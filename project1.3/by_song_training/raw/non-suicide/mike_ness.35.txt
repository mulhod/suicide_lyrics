#Don't Drag Me Down

Children are taught to hate. 
Parents just couldn't wait. 
Some are rich and some are poor. 
Others will just suffer more.
Have you ever been ashamed and felt society try to keep you down? 
I begin to watch things change And see them turn around.
Turn around, they'll try to keep you down. 
Turn around, turn around, don't drag me down.
Ignorance like a gun in hand. 
Reach out to the promised land.
Your history books are full of lies.
Media-blitz going to dry your eyes.
Have you ever been afraid and felt society try to keep you down? 
I begin to watch things change and see them turn around.
Turn around, they'll try to keep you down. 
Turn around, turn around, don't drag me down.
Ignorance like a gun in hand. 
Reach out to the promised land.
Your history books are full of lies. 
Media-blitz going to dry your eyes.
You're eighteen, want to be a man. 
Your granddaddy's in the Ku Klux Klan, taking two steps forward and four steps back. 
Gonna go to the White House and paint it black.
Turn around, They'll try to keep you down. 
Turn around, turn around, they'll try to keep you down,
Turn around, don't drag me down.
