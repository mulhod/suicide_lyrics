#Bakersfield

Take me down that line, going to tow that heavy load.
I can't seem to make it, make it on my own.
Turn the lights down low now. 
Turn down our bed. 
I can't seem to get you out of my head.
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're so close yet so far, far away. 
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're a million miles away, yeah.
I feel the heat coming down now. 
Sweat runs down my face. 
I can hardly make it go, make it through this day. 
Was it something that I said, or something I didn't do. 
Eighteen more hours, girl, 'til I'm home to you.
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're so close yet so far, far away. 
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're a million miles away, yeah.
So I walk out that lonely truck stop with my head hanging down wondering how in the hell I got myself into this mess, and more importantly how I was going to get myself out of it.
So I wrote a song for you, baby girl. 
And I hope when I return home, the locks be not changed on the doors and there's still a spot for me on that big ol' California king size bed.
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're so close yet so far, far away. 
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're a million miles away, yeah.
Won't you come see me in Bakersfield? 
Ooh, I'm not a million miles away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
