#Don't Take Me for Granted

I'm your worn in leather jacket.
I'm the volume in your fucked up teenage band.
A bag of smokes and a six pack, I'm the dreams you had walkin down the railroad tracks, you and me.
I'm your first taste of romance.
I'm your first broken heart on a saturday night.
Guys like us be not got no chance, but I'm the thing that keeps you and me alive, but not forever.
So take me down the road.
Take me to the show.
It's something to believe in that no one else knows.
But don't take me for granted.
I'm the blood on your guitar.
I'm that wave you caught back in 1975.
I'm as strong as a thousand armies.
I'm as soft as a pedal on a long stem rose.
I am love.
So take me down the road.
Take me to the show.
It's something to believe in that no one else knows.
But don't take me for granted.
I'm with you when you're born.
You can take me when you die
With all the reasons why.
But don't take me for granted.
No one knows.
Don't take me for granted.
