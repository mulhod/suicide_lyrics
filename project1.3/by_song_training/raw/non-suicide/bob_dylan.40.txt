Aing. it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon, especially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon?
Aing. going to hang no picture.
Aing. going to hang no picture-frame.
Aing. going to hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.

I got for good luck my black tooth.
I got my dark sunglasses,
I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing.
I just might tell you the truth.

Oh, I be not going to say her name.
I got a woman in Jackson.
I be not going to say her name.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I, I love her just the same.
