#Misty morning

Misty morning, don't see no sun.
I know you're out there somewhere having fun.
There is one mystery, yeah, I just can't express.
To give your more, to receive your less.
One of my good friends said, in a reggae rhythm: "Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim."
The power of philosophy, yeah, floats through my head light like a feather, heavy as lead, light like a feather, heavy as lead, yeah.
See no sun, oh.
Time has come.
I want you, I want you to straighten out my tomorrow, uh!
I want, I want, I want you, oh, whoa!
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow!
Misty morning, don't see no sun.
I know you're out there somewhere having fun.
Mysteries I just can't express.
How can you ever give your more to receive your less?
Like my good friend said, in a reggae rhythm: "You can't jump, you can't jump in the water if you can't swim."
I want you, I want you, I want you to straighten out my today, my tomorrow, my, my, my, my, my.
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow.
On a misty morning, uh! 
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow.
Straighten out my tomorrow, my tomorrow! 
Need some straightening out!
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow, mist!
I want, mist, you to straighten out my tomorrow, misty, oh! 
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow.
