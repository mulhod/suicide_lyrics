#Window

I was staring out the window the whole time he was talking to me.
It was a filthy pane of glass. 
I couldn't get a clear view.
And as he wenton and on, it wasn't the outside world I could see.
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through.
So I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
Better that I break the window than him or her or me.
I was never focused on just one thing.
My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft.
It may look like I'm concentrated on a very clear view, but I'm as good as asleep.
I bet you didn't know.
It takes a lot of it away, if you do.
I had to break the windo.
It just had to be.
Better that I break the window than him or her or me.
I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
It was in my way.
Better that I break the window than forget what I had to say, or miss what I should see.
Because the fact being that whatever's in frontof me is covering my view.
So I can't see what I'm seeing, in fact. 
I only see what I'm looking through.
So again I done the right thing.
I was never worried about that.
The answer's always been in clear view.
But even when the window was cleaned, I still can't see for the fact that when it's clean it's so clear, I can't tell what I'm looking through.
So I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
It was in my way.
Better that I break the window than him or her or me.
I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
Better that I break the window than miss what I should see.
I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
It was in my way.
Better that I break the window than forget what I had to say, or miss what I should see, or break him her or me.
Especially me.
