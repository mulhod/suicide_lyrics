#Burning and looting

This morning I woke up in a curfew.
Oh, God, I was a prisoner, too, yeah!
Could not recognize the faces standing over me.
They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality, eh!
How many rivers do we have to cross, before we can talk to the boss, eh?
All that we got, it seems we have lost.
We must have really paid the cost.
That's why we gonna be burning and looting tonight.
Say we gonna burn and loot.
Burning and looting tonight.
One more thing: burning all pollution tonight.
Oh, yeah, yeah, burning all illusion tonight.
Oh, stop them!
Give me the food and let me grow.
Let the Roots Man take a blow.
All them drugs gonna make you slow now.
It's not the music of the ghetto, eh!
Weeping and wailing tonight.
Who can stop the tears?
Weeping and wailing tonight.
We've been suffering these long, long years!
Weeping and wailing tonight.
Will you say cheer?
Weeping and wailing tonight, but where?
Give me the food and let me grow.
Let the Roots Man take a blow.
I must say: All them, all them drugs gonna make you slow.
It's not the music of the ghetto.
We gonna be burning and looting tonight.
To survive, yeah!
Burning and looting tonight.
Save your baby lives.
Burning all pollution tonight.
Pollution, yeah, yeah!
Burning all illusion tonight, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!
Burning and looting tonight.
Burning and looting tonight.
