#Slave Driver

Slave driver, the table is turn.
Catch a fire.
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, now.
Catch a fire.
Slave driver, the table is turn.
Catch a fire.
Catch a fire. 
Gonna get burn.
Catch a fire, whoa, now!
Every time I hear the crack of a whip, my blood runs cold.
I remember on the slave ship, how they brutalize the very souls.
Today they say that we are free only to be chained in poverty.
Good God, I think it's illiteracy.
It's only a machine that makes money.
Slave driver, the table is turn, you all.
Slave driver, uh, the table is turn, baby, now.
Catch a fire.
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, baby, now. 
Catch a fire.
Slave driver, the table is turn, you all.
Catch a fire.
Catch a fire.
So you can get burn, now.
Catch a fire.
Every time I hear the crack of a whip, my blood runs cold.
I remember on the slave ship how they brutalize the very soul.
Oh, God, have mercy on our souls!
Oh, slave driver, the table is turn, you all.
Catch a fire.
Catch a fire, so you can get burn. 
Catch a fire.
Slave driver, the table is turn, you all.
Catch a fire.
Catch a fire.
