#Get Him Back

One man, he disappoint me.
He give me the gouge and he take my glee.
Now every other man I see remind me of the one man who disappoint me.
But wait till I get him back.
He won't have a back to scratch.
Yeah, keep turning that chin and you will see my face as I figure how to kill what I cannot catch.
So I say, and on I go to another one to disappoint me so.
Next one up, a contemptible snob.
He live to put things in their place.
He did a commendable job.
He put himself so low, he can hardly even look me in the face.
O, he made my blood just burn.
I flipped so far, I thought that I would not return.
But the last one I had who was getting my hopes up, I might've been a little fast to dismiss.
I think he let me down, when he didn't disappoint me.
He didn't always guess right, but he usually got my gist.
So wait till I get him back.
I'm going to bring him home, and I'll watch him unpack.
Yeah keep turning that chin, and you will see my face is fixed on the one I'm going to get back.
I'm going to get him back, I am.
I'm going to get him back, I really am.
