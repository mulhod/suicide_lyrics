#Going, Going, Gone

I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend.
There's not much more to be said.
it's the top of the end.
I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm gone.
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text and I don't really care, ooh, what happens next.
I'm just going.
I'm going.
I'm gone.
I been hanging on the threads.
I been playing it straight.
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late.
So I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm gone.
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart and you'll be fine at the end of the line.
All that's gold doesn't shine.
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
I been walking the road.
I've been living on the edge.
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge.
So I'm going.
I'm just going.
I'm gone.
