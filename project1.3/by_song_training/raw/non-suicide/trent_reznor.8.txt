#Terrible lie

Hey God, why are you doing this to me?
Hey God, am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?
Why am I seething with this animosity?
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology.
Terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie.
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean.
Hey God, seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.
Hey God, I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.
Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems?
Terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie.
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to.
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to.
Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.
Hey God, I lost my ignorance, security and pride.
Hey God, I'm all alone in a world you must despise.
Hey God, I believed your promises, your promises and lies.
Terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie.
You made me throw it all away, my morals left to decay.
How many you betray.
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease.
My skin is begging you please.
I'm on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe.
I give you everything.
My sweet everything.
