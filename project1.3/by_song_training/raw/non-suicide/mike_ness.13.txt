#I Wasn't Born to Follow

When I grow up, going to be a star.
Gonna sing my songs and play my guitar, I'm ready.
Gonna change the world, going to turn the page, going to say what I feel, let out this rage, get ready.
We're going down, down to the streets below.
Gonna sing the songs of the streets again.
Gonna knock me off my feet, so get ready.
I'll sing a song for the fallen angels.
This one goes to all the unsung heroes.
We're going down, down to the streets below, cause don't you know, I wasn't born to follow.
I realize that in your eyes you got ideas but I got mine, get ready.
Here comes the new generation. 
Hope they feel and fight the same way as we did.
We're going down, down to the streets below, cause I wasn't born, I wasn't born to follow, no.
When I grow up, going to be a star.
Gonna sing my songs and play my guitar, I'm ready.
Gonna change the world, going to turn the page, going to say what I feel, let out this rage, get ready.
We're going down, down to the streets below, cause don't you know, I wasn't born to follow.
We're going down, down to the streets below, cause don't you know, I wasn't born to follow.
We're going down, down, down, down.
We're going down, down, down, down.
I said goodbye to the masses. 
I wasn't born to follow.
