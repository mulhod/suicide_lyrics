#Story of my Life

High school seemed like such a blur.
I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections, and in class, I dreamed all day, of a rock 'n' roll weekend.
And the girl in the front of the room, so close yet so far you know she never seemed to notice that this silly schoolboy crush wasn't just pretend.
Life goes by so fast.
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past.
Story of my life.
And I went down my old neighborhood.
The faces have all changed; there's no one left to talk to, and the pool hall I loved as a kid is now a Seven Eleven.
I went downtown to look for a job.
I had no training, no experience to speak of.
And I looked at the holes in my jeans, and turned and headed back.
Life goes by so fast.
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past.
Story of my life.
Good times come, and good times go.
I only wish the good times would last a little longer.
And I think about the good times we had and why they had to end.
So I sit at the edge of my bed.
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song.
Thinking 'bout what you're doing now, and when you're coming back.
Life goes by so fast.
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past.
Story of my life.
