#From a Buick 6

I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge, I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge, again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Well, she don't make me nervous.
she don't talk too much.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Come on!
Well, you know, I need a steam-shovel, mama, to keep away the dead.
I need a dump-truck, baby, to unload my head.
She brings me everything and more and just like I said, well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
