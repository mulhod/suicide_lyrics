#Can't Take It with You

I'll tell you something, baby that's a fact: Never see a hearse, with a luggage rack.
All your money, your hard earned pay, it don't mean shit, baby, at the end of the end of the day.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, oh no you can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you when you go.
As sure as life, and the light of day, I'll tell you something, I've heard them they say: It don't matter, baby, what your worth, since we all, we all go back to mother earth.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, oh no you can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you when you go.
Work all your life, you become a slave.
There be not no spending when you're in the grave.
Even if it's raining, thousand dollar bills, think of me baby, in your mansion on the hill.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you (oh yeah), can't take it with you, can't take it with you, oh no you can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you when you go.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you...
