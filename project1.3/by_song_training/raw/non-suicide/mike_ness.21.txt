#Sick Boys

Sick-boy, in his faded blue jeans.
Sick-boy, black leather jacket scene.
Sick-boy, he's always in trouble with the law, don't ya know.
Sick-boy, he carries a switchblade knife.
Sick-boy, likes to get into fights.
Sick-boy, he'll go drinking with the boys all night long.
Sick boys-oh way oh.
Sick boys-na na na na.
Sick boys.
Sick-boy, rides a big motorbike.
Sick-boy, combs his hair up just right.
Sick-boy, with tattoos up and down his arms, don't ya know.
Sick-boy, he's got a girl wrapped around his arm.
Sick-boy, with his street-like charm.
Sick-boy, he'll make love to her all night long, don't ya know.
Sick boys-oh way oh.
Sick boys-na na na na.
He's a sick boy,
Such a sick boy.
We're all sick boys.
I'm a sick boy.
