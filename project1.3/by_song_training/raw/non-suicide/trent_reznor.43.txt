#The Great Destroyer

Say your name, try to speak as clearly as you can.
You know, everything gets written down.
Nod your head, just in case they could be watching with their shiny satellites.
I hope they cannot see the limitless potential living inside of me to murder everything.
I hope they cannot see, I am the great destroyer.
Turn it up, listen to the shit they pump into your head, filling you with apathy.
Hold your breath.
Wait until you know the time is right. 
On time, the end is near.
I hope they cannot see the limitless potential living inside of me. 
I murder everything.
I hope they cannot see, I am the great destroyer.
