#Time will tell

Jah would never give the power to a baldhead.
Run come crucify the Dread.
Time alone, oh, time will tell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Time alone, oh, time will tell.
you think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Back them up; oh, not the brothers, but the ones who sets them up.
Time alone, oh, time will tell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Time alone, oh, time will tell.
you think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my children are crying.
Oh, children, weep no more!
Oh, my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree.
All you have spoke.
Oh, children, weep no more.
Weep no more children.
Weep no more!
Jah would never give the power to a baldhead.
Run come crucify the Dread.
Time alone, oh, time will tell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
Time alone, oh, time will tell.
Think you're in heaven, but you living in hell.
