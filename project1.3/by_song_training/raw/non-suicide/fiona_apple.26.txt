#Love Ridden

Love ridden, I've looked at you with the focus I gave to my birthday candles.
I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow.
And baby, I wished for you.
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed, and I want to crawl in with you, but I cry instead.
I want your warm, but it will only make me colder when it's over.
So I can't tonight, baby.
No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on, and in a little while, we'll only have to wave.
My hand won't hold you down no more.
The path is clear to follow through.
I stood too long in the way of the door mp fiona apple, and now I'm giving up on you.
No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on, and in a little while, we'll only have to wave.
No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on, and in a little while, we'll only have to wave.
