#Reach for the Sky

When I was young I was invincible.
I found myself not thinking twice.
I never thought about no future, it's just a roll of the dice.
But the day may come when you got something to lose, and just when you think you're done paying dues, you say to yourself: "Dear, God What have I Done?" and hope its not too late, cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Yesterday is history, and tomorrow is a mystery.
But baby right now, it's just about you and me.
You can run, you can hide, just like Bonnie and Clyde.
Reach for the sky be not never going to die.
And I thank the Lord for the love that I have found, and hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
So if you please take this moment, try if you can to make it last.
Don't think about no future, and just forget about the past.
And make it last.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky I be not never going down.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky I be not never coming down.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky I be not never going down.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
