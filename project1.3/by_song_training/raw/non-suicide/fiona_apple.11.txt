#Not About Love

The early cars already are drawing deep breaths past my door, and last night's phrases sick with lack of basis are still writhing on my floor.
And it doesn't seem fair that your wicked words should work in holding me down.
No, it doesn't seem right to take information given at close range for the gag, and the bind and the ammunition round.
Conversation once colored by esteem became duologue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation, my palate got clean.
Now I could taste your agenda while you're spitting your cud.
And it doesn't make sense I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown.
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range for the gag, and the bind, and the ammunition round.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
I miss that stupid ache.
What is this posture I have to stare at.
That's what he said when I'm sitting up straight.
Change the name of the game because he lost, and he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late.
But I'm not being fair, because I chose to listen to that filthy mouth, but I'd like to choose right.
Take all the things that I've said that he stole, put 'em in a sack, swing 'em over my shoulder, turn on my heels, step out of this sight.
Try to live in a lovelier light.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
I miss that stupid ache.
