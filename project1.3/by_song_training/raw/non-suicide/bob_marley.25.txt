#Night shift

The sun shall not smite I by day, nor the moon by night.
And everything that I do shall be upfull and right.
And if it's all night, it got to be alright!
If it's all night, got to be alright!
Your mamma won't lose this one.
You're the lucky one under the sun.
If you make me move, then you know you got the groove.
All night, it's alright!
All night, yeah, it's alright!
Working on a forklift in the night shift.
Working on a night shift, with the forklift, from A.M. to P.M. 
Did you say that? 
Why did you say that?
Working on a night shift, yeah!
Did you say that? 
Why did you say that? 
Up full and right!
Well, if it's all night! 
If it's alright!
all night, all night! 
Warehouse, alright, you're empty, yeah!
Go around the corner.
Bring your goods!
Go around the other corner.
Bring your suitcases.
By the sweat of my brow, eat your bread! 
By the sweat of my brow, eat your bread!
All night, all night! 
alright, alright!
All night, all night! 
alright, alright, oh, yeah! 
Moon by night.
Why did you say that? 
Oh, yeah, up full and right!
Working on a night shift with the forklift. 
Moon by night!
Working on the night shift, oh, yeah! 
Up full and right!
