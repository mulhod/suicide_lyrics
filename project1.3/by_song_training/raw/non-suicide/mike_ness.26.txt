#Drug Train

It'll take you as high as the heavens.
It'll take you to the depths of hell.
It'll make you friends, it'll take your friends who will never live to tell.
Drug train, drug train.
Drug train, drug train.
The traing. first stop is pleasure.
The scond stop is fun.
But in a jail cell, baby, in a hospital bed, you'll need hope, because you
be not got none.
Drug train, drug train.
Drug train, drug train.
The train passes through the graveyard.
May the loved ones rest in peace.
For the last stop baby is a violent crash and hard times they never cease.
Drug train, drug train.
Drug train, drug train.
