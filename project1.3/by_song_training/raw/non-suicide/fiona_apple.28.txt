#A Mistake

I'm going to make a mistake.
I'm going to do it on purpose.
I'm going to waste my time. 
'Cause I'm full as a tick, and I'm scratching at the surface.
And what I find is mine.
And when the day is done, and I look back, and the fact is I had fun, fumbling around.
All the advice I shunned, and I ran where they told me not to run, but I sure had fun, so I'm going to fuck it up again.
I'm going to do another detour.
Unpave my path.
And if you want to make sense, what you looking at me for?
I'm no good at math.
And when I find my way back, the fact is I just may stay, or I may not.
I've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake.
I want to make mistake; why can't I make a mistake?
I'm always doing what I think I should.
Almost always doing everybody good.
Why?
Do I want to do right?
Of course, but do I really want to feel I'm forced to answer you?
hell no.
I've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake. 
I want to Make a mistake.
why can't I make a mistake?
I'm always doing what I think I should.
Almost always doing everybody good.
Why?
