#In This Twilight

Watch the sun, as it crawls across a final time.
And it feels like, like it was a friend.
It is watching us, and the world we set on fire.
Do you wonder if it feels the same?
And the sky is filled with light.
Can you see it?
All the black is really white, if you believe it.
As your time is running out, let me take away your doubt.
You can find a better a place in this twilight.
From dust to dust, ashes in your hair remind me what it feels like and I won't feel again.
Night descends.
Could I have been a better person?
If I could only do it all again.
And the sky is filled with light.
Do you see it?
All the black is really white, if you believe it.
And the longing that you feel. 
You know none of this is real.
You will find a better a place in this twilight.
