#Gotta Know the Rules

Spent my whole life yeah looking for something.
What it was, I'm not really sure.
I looked for happiness, but only found sorrow.
Then I realized how to unlock the door yeah, yeah, yeah.
So you think you've got it figured out?
It don't come easy, maybe just for fools.
Some say life is a struggle now.
It's a game now, just got to know the rules.
Gotta know the rules.
Most people go through life thinking:
Take what you can and leave the weak behind.
Never stop to think what can you give now.
Too afraid to learn what you might find yeah, yeah, yeah
So you think you've got it figured out?
It don't come easy, maybe just for fools.
Some say life is a struggle now.
It's a game now, just got to know the rules.
Gotta know the rules.
Spent my whole life yeah doing things my way.
Doing unto others, knowing its wrong.
When's the last time you looked in the mirror?
When's the last time you liked what you saw, yeah, yeah, yeah?
So you think you've got it figured out?
It don't come easy, maybe just for fools.
Some say life is a struggle now.
It's a game now, just got to know the rules.
Gotta know the rules.
