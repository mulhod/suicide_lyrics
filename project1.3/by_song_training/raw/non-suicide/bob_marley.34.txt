#Three little birds

Don't worry about a thing because every little thing gonna be alright.
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, because every little thing gonna be alright!"
Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun.
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true, saying, "This is my message to you."
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, because every little thing gonna be alright."
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, because every little thing gonna be alright!"
Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun.
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true, saying, "This is my message to you!"
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, worry about a thing, oh, every little thing gonna be alright, don't worry!"
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing"
I won't worry!
"because every little thing gonna be alright."
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, because every little thing gonna be alright" 
I won't worry!
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, because every little thing gonna be alright."
Singing: "Don't worry about a thing, oh no, because every little thing gonna be alright!
