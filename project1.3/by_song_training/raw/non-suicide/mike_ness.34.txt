#Dear Lover

Yeah, loving over and over again now.
It be not nothing girl till you've felt the pain.
Up against the wall.
Why does love always have to hurt?
Your scratches run across my back and then a tear.
Dear lover, I can't take the pain no more.
Dear lover, I pick my heart up from the floor.
Dear lover, I can't believe it's come to this.
Dear lover, give me one last painful kiss.
There be not nothing in this world for free now.
So how high of a price will you pay?
Hear the screams so loud, wake up to the broken glass.
It's a scene from bad to worse and many more tears.
Dear lover, I can't take the pain no more.
Dear lover, I pick my heart up from the floor.
Dear lover, I can't believe it's come to this.
Dear lover, give me one last painful kiss.
Dear lover, I can't take the pain no more.
Dear lover, I pick my heart up from the floor.
Dear lover, I can't believe it's come to this.
Dear lover, give me one last painful kiss. 
One last kiss, one last kiss, one last kiss.
