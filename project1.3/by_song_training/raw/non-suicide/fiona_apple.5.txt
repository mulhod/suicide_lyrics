#Tymps (The Sick In The Head Song)

Those boon times wentbust.
My feet of clay, they dried to dust.
The red isn't the red we painted; It's just rust.
And the signature thing that used to bring a following, I have trouble now even remembering.
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night, and keep on letting him change all my plans?
I'm either so sick in the head I need to be bled dry to quit, or I just really used to love him.
I sure hope thats it.
I knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch.
Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, its just mush.
And the signature thing is only growing harrowing.
I should have no trouble now to keep from following.
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night, and keep on letting him change all my plans?
I'm either so sick in the head I need to be bled dry to quit, or I just really used to love him.
I sure hope thats it.
Those boon times wentbust.
My feet of clay, they dried to dust.
The red isn't the red we painted; It's just rust.
And the signature thing that used to bring a following, I have trouble now even remembering.
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night, and keep on letting him change all my plans?
I'm either so sick in the head I need to be bled dry to quit, or I just really used to love him, or I just really used to love him, Or I just really used to love him.
I sure hope that's it.
