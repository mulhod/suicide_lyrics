#When Angels Sing

At last we meet again, dear God, hear the angels sing. 
The funerals are nicer when we know you're there, when the angels sing. 
Sometimes I try so hard to understand the things you do.
I like to question you when it all comes down, hear the angels sing.
Stand up strong, feel the pain, when the angels sing.
Love and death don't mean a thing till the angels sing.
The prisoners pray when they're on to death row, when the angels sing.
The junky cries for love but it's all run out, when the angels sing.
The sins of the world.
And it's cold on the streets and you're all alone and the tears they start to fall when it all comes down, hear the angels sing.
Stand up strong, feel the pain, when the angels sing.
Love and death don't mean a thing, till the angels sing.
Little by little, day by day, I watch the children play.
Cause life and death don't mean a thing, till the angels sing.
When the angel of death comes to looking for me, hear the angels sing.
I hope I was everything I was supposed to be, when the angels sing.
There's got to be a heaven cause I've already done my time in hell.
And a little, baby's born, when it all comes down, hear the angels sing.
Stand up strong, feel the pain, when the angels sing.
Love and death don't mean a thing, till the angels sing.
Little by little, day by day, I watch the children play because life and death don't mean a thing till the angels sing.
