#Suck

There is no God up in the sky tonight.
No sign of heaven anywhere in sight.
All that was true is left behind.
Once I could see now I am blind.
Don't want your dreams you try to sell.
This disease I give to myself.
How does it feel? 
How does it feel?
She makes it sweeter than the sun.
I get too tight I come undone.
I bow my head to confess.
The temple walls are made of flesh.
Runs up my arms 'til I'm on track.
Itches my skin right off of my back.
I'll heal your wounds.
I'll set you free.
I'm Jesus Christ on ecstasy.
How does it feel?
How does it feel? 
I am so dirty on on the inside.
I am so dirty on on the inside. 
I am so dirty on on the inside. 
I am so dirty on on the inside. 
How does it feel?
How does it feel? 
Suck, suck, suck, suck.
A thousand lips, a thousand tongues, a thousand throats, a thousand lungs, a thousand ways to make it true I want to do terrible things to you.
