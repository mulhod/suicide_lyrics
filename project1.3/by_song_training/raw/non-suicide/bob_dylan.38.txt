#Maggie's Farm

I be not going to work on Maggie's farm no more.
No, I be not going to work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.

I be not going to work for Maggie's brother no more.
No, I be not going to work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, he hands you a nickel.
he hands you a dime.
he asks you with a grin if you're having a good time.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I be not going to work for Maggie's brother no more.
I be not going to work for Maggie's pa no more.
No, I be not going to work for Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
The National Guard stands around his door.

I be not going to work for Maggie's ma no more.
No, I be not going to work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
I be not going to work for Maggie's ma no more.
I be not going to work on Maggie's farm no more.
I be not going to work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I try my best to be just like I am, but everybody wants you to be just like them.
They say, "Sing while you slave!"
and I just get bored.
I be not going to work on Maggie's farm no more.
