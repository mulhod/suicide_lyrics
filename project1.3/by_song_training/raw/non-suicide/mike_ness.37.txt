#Through These Eyes

Through these eyes I've seen love and I've seen hate.
I've seen the violence and the tears through these eyes.
I got my schooling on the streets.
I've seen the things in life you don't want to see.
Through these eyes, I've seen the shape of things to come, and I've watched them all fall apart, through these eyes.
I've seen the broken homes, they cry.
I've seen the poor man's face as he stands in line.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on.
Through these eyes, I've looked the devil in the face and I've seen God's holy grace, through these eyes.
I've tried to walk the straighter line.
I found myself again but nearly lost my mind.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on, yeah.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on.
