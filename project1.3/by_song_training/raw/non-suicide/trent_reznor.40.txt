#God Given

Hey man, please don't make a sound.
Take a look around.
Can't you see what's right in front of you?
Ah, have a little taste.
No more time to waste.
You don't want to get left behind cause it's all coming down right now.
How hard is it to see?
Put your faith in me.
I sure wouldn't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood.
You should get where you belong.
Everything you know is wrong.
Come on, sing along, everybody now.
God given!
And he gives us sight, and we see the light, and it burns so bright.
Now we know we're right.
When his kingdom come, and thy will be done, we have just begun.
We're the chosen ones.
I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you.
Wait, step into the light.
How can this be right?
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave.
Guess you can not win, with the color of your skin.
You won't be getting in to the promised land.
Besides this is just another case, you people still don't know your place.
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face.
We are the devine. 
Separated from the swine.
Come on, sing along, everybody now.
God given!
And he gives us sight, and we see the light, and it burns so bright. 
Now we know we're right.
When his kingdom come, and thy will be done, we have just begun. 
We're the chosen ones.
And he gives us sight.
And we see the light.
And it burns so bright.
Now we know we're right.
When his kingdom come, and thy will be done, and the father and the holy son, we're the chosen ones.
I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you.
