#I Am a Lonesome Hobo

I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit and I've served time for everything except begging on the street.
Well, once I was rather prosperous.
there was nothing I did lack.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back, but I did not trust my brother.
I carried him to blame, which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone, but let me just warn you all before I do pass on.
Stay free from petty jealousies.
live by no man's code.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
