#African Herbsman

All twinkling lee, can't see the right rose when the streams abate.
The old slave men might grind slow, but it grinds fine, yeah.
African herbsman, why linger on?
Just concentrate, because heaven lives on.
Greet-I-eth slave men will look with a scorn, with a transplanted heart.
Yes, how quick they had to part.
How quick they had to part.
The remembrance of today is the sad feeling of tomorrow.
How quick, oh part, oh yeah.
African herbsman, seize your time.
I'm taking illusion on the edge of my mind.
I'm taking losers down through my life.
Down through my life, yeah.
Yes, how quick they had to part.
How quick they had to part.
Dideh part, yes, they part.
In remembrance of today.
How quick they had to part.
African herbsman, why linger on?
Just concentrate, because your heaven lives on.
Greet-I-eth slave men will look with a scorn, with a transplanted heart.
Yes, how quick they have to part.
How quick they have to part.
In remembrance of today brings sad feelings of tomorrow.
Yes, how quick they have to.
Lead me on, oh, Lord, I pray to you.
African herbsman, African herbsman, African, African herbsman.
