#Crown of Thorns

Pretty much been alone now for almost five years.
I could always find a way to hide these bitter tearsa
And still I'm a-waiting a-wishing somehow; I wish I knew then what I know now.
It's no bed of roses, It be not no crown of thorns.
Better than lonely.
I've been there before.
Got a bad reputation for playing with love.
Gonna play again now and beat the odds above.
And still I'm a-waiting and wishing somehow; I wish I knew then what I know now.
It's no bed of roses, It be not no crown of thorns.
Better than lonely.
I've been there before.
Are you tired of being alone?
Or have you fallen out of love?
Do you care enough about yourself?
I have worn your crown of thorns.
It's no bed of roses, It be not no crown of thorns.
Better than lonely.
I've been there before.
It's no bed of roses, It be not no crown of thorns.
Better than lonely.
I've been there before.
