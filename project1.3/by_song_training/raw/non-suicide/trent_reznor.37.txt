#Capital G

I pushed a button and elected him to office, and he pushed a button and it dropped a bomb.
You pushed the button and could watch it on the television.
Those motherfuckers didn't last too long, ha ha.
I'm sick of hearing about the haves and the have-nots.
Have some personal accountability.
The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is the more we let you have, the less that I'll be keeping for me.
Well I used to stand for something, now I'm on my hands and knees.
Traded in my god for this one, and he signs his name with a capital G.
Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala.
Don't really see what all the fuss is about.
Aing. going to worry 'bout no future generations, and I'm sure somebody going to figure it out.
Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person, you haven't had enough to know what it's like.
You're only angry cause you wish you were in my position.
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right, alright!
Well I used to stand for something, but forgot what that could be.
There's a lot of me inside you.
Maybe you're afraid to see.
Well I used to stand for something, now I'm on my hands and knees.
Traded in my god for this one, and he signs his name with a capital G.
