#Brainwashing

Ooh-ooh, old Mr. Joe, he build a house away on top of some hill.
Old Mr. Joe knew he had to go, so he got right down and wrote bank will.
He say now, here's to mother hen and her chicken. 
Lord, have mercy now.
Master, will you take a roll in the mud like you know you should?
The old barnyard, the old barnyard.
Birds and the chick, ooh-wee.
Who's got to watch out for brother mongoose with his top hat and walking-stick?
It's just the poor's brainwashing, poor's brainwashing. 
They told me a long time ago: It's just the poor's brainwashing, ooh-wee, poor's brainwashing. 
Now look at a thing like this:
Cinderella and her long-lost fellow, in the midnight hour, she lost her silver slipper.
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall while Jack and Jill had themselves a fall.
It's just the poor's brainwashing, poor's brainwashing, and I don't need it no longer.
Poor brainwashing.
It's just the poor's brainwashing coming through to a poor man's child.
Ooh-wee, look at this.
Little Miss Muffet she sat on a tuffet while Little Red Riding Hood delivered her grandmom's food.
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh-wee, look at one more thing like this.
The cow jumping over the moon while the dish got jealous.
He grabbed the handy spoon.
It's just the poor's brainwashing and I don't need it no longer.
I don't want it no longer.
I don't need it no longer. 
Poor's brainwashing.
And I don't care for no more brainwashing, poor's brainwashing.
