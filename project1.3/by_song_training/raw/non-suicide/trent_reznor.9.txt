#Down in it

Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky, and I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.
Sometimes I don't believe them myself, and I decided i was never coming down. 
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.
It was just about too small to see, but I watched it way too long. 
It was pulling me down.  
I was up about it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it.
Well shut up. 
So what, what does it matter now? 
I was swimming in the haze now I crawl on the ground. 
And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me. 
Try to laugh about it now, but isn't it funny how everything works out. 
"I guess the joke's on me," she said.
I was up about it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it.
I used to be so big and strong.
I used to know my right from wrong.
I used to never be afraid.
I used to be somebody
I used to have something inside.
Now just this hole that's open wide.
I used to want it all.
I used to be somebody.
I'll cross my heart and hope to die, but the needle's already in my eye. 
And all the world's weight is on my back, and I don't even know why. 
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory.
I looked him right in the eye and said goodbye.
 was up about it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it. 
Now I'm down in it.
