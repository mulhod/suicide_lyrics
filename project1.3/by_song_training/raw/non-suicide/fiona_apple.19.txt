#Never Is A Promise

You'll never see the courage I know.
Its colors' richness won't appear within your view.
I'll never glow the way that you glow.
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you, but as the scenery grows, I see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception.
My feelings swell and stretch.
I see from greater heights.
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you.
You'll say you understand, but you don't understand.
You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye, but never is a promise and you can't afford to lie.
You'll never touch these things that I hold.
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own.
You'll never feel the heat of this soul.
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you.
You'll say: don't fear your dreams.
It's easier than it seems.
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high, but never is a promise and you can't afford to lie.
You'll never live the life that I live.
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night.
You'll never hear the message I give.
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight, but as the scenery grows, I see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception.
My feelings swell and stretch.
I see from greater heights.
I realise what I am now too smart to mention to you.
You'll say you understand.
You'll never understand.
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why.
I don't know what to believe in.
You won't know who I am.
You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry, but never is a promise and I'll never need a lie.
