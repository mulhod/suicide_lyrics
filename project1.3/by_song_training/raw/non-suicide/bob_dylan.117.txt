#One Too Many Mornings

Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark and the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade and I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid and I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign and I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good when everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
You're right from your side.
I'm right from mine.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
