#I Don't Believe You

I can't understand.
She let go of my hand and left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like to know why she did go, but I can't get close to her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing night-time, she said she would never forget.
But now morning is clear.
It's like I be not here.
She acts like we never met.
It's all new to me, like some mystery.
It could even be like a myth.
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one that last night I was with.
From darkness, dreams are deserted.
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she'd unlock her voice once and talk instead of acting like we never met.
If she be not feeling well, then why don't she tell instead of turning her back to my face?
Without any doubt she seems too far out for me to return to or chase.
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played.
Her mouth was watery and wet.
But now something has changed for she be not the same.
She just acts like we never have met.
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess to anything I might've tried.
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong, I'd wish she'd tell me what it is.
I'll run and hide.
Though the night ran swirling and whirling, I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't.
Evidently she won't.
She just acts like we never have met.
I'm leaving today.
I'll be on my way.
Of this I can't say very much.
But if you want me to, I can be just like you and pretend that we never have touched.
And, if anybody asks me, "Is it easy to forget?"
I'll say, "It's easily done.
You just pick anyone and pretend that you never have met."
