#Writing on the Wall

There was a time when you were proud.
You looked up to me with big eyes, and I could do no wrong.
There's something inside, that's clearly tearing both of us apart, ooh ooh there's something inside.
I wonder where you are tonight, and what you did with your day.
Can't find the words to say.
Did you feel the sun?
Did you feel the warmness of my heart?
Ooh ooh did you feel at all?
They say if you love someone, you got to let them go.
And if they return to you, that's surely how you'll know.
Ooh ooh, I can read the writing on the wall, ooh ooh, but I can't let go.
They say if you love someone, you got to let them go.
And if they return to you, that's surely how you'll know.
Ooh ooh, I can read the writing on the wall, ooh ooh, but I can't let go.
I'm hopelessly aware of the good and bad traits we share.
It's like looking at myself.
And I know that at times I could've handled things differently, ooh ooh, but know my intentions were well.
They say if you love someone, you got to let them go.
And if they return to you, that's surely how you'll know.
Ooh ooh, I can read the writing on the wall, ooh ooh, but I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
