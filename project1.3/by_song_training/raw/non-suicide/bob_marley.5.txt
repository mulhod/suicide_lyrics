#Sun Is Shining

Sun is shining.
The weather is sweet.
Make you wanna move your dancing feet to the rescue.
Here I am.
Want you to know, you all.
Can you understand?
When the morning gather the rainbow, yeah, yeah.
Want you to know, I'm a rainbow too now.
To the rescue, here I am.
Want you to know, you all.
Can you, can you, can you understand?
Sun is shining.
The weather is sweet now.
Make you wanna move your dancing feet, yeah.
But to the rescue, here I am.
Want you to know just if you can.
Here I stand.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Can you understand me now, baby?
Do you believe me?
