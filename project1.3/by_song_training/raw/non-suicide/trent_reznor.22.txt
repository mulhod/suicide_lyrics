#Ruiner

You had all of them on your side, didn't you?
You believe in all your lies, didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove. 
He's got nothing to lose, and now he made you believe.
The ruiner's your only friend. 
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives.
The raping of the innocent; you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees.
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease.
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd you get so long?
You had to give them all a sign, didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine, didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector. 
He's an infector, serving his shit to his flies.
Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize.
Maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go.
And maybe that fucked me up so much more than you'll ever know.
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd you get so long?
What you gave to me, my perfect ring of scars.
You know I can see what you really are.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop me now.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop me now.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop me now.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop.
