#To Your Love

Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow.
Another cue for you to fold your ears.
Another train of thought too hard to follow, chugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gears.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is the evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance to your love, to your love, to your love.
I would've warned you, but really, what's the point?
Caution could, but rarely ever helps.
Don't be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint.
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance to your love, to your love, to your love.
My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you, but by the time I'm close to you, I lose my desideratum and now you, so now you have it.
So baby tell me what's the word?
Am I your gal, or should I get out of town?
I just need to be reassured.
Do you just deal it out, or can you deal with what I lay down?
Please forgive me, for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love.
