#Midnight ravers

You can't tell the woman from the man.
No, I say you can't because they're dressed in the same pollution, dressed in the same pollution.
Their mind is confused with confusion, with their problems since they've no solution.
They become the midnight ravers.
Someone say: Please, don't let me down!
Oh, please, don't let me, oh, please don't let me down!
Midnight ravers! 
Midnight ravers!
Please don't, Oh, please, please, don't let me down, down, down, down, down!
Don't let me down.
Don't let me down.
I see ten thousand chariots and they coming without horses, coming without horses.
The riders, they cover their face, so you couldn't make them out in smoky place, make them out in smoky places, in that musical stampede, where everyone is doing their thing.
Musical stampede, people swinging.
Musical stampede, someone say:
People, ride on! 
Keep riding!
Keep riding!
Ride on!
Keep riding, midnight ravers!
People, ride on! 
Keep riding!
Keep riding!
Ride on!
Keep riding, midnight ravers!
I can't tell my woman from the man.
She is dressed in the same pollution, dressed in the same pollution.
Her mind is confused with confusion.
To my problem, seems there's never, never no solution!
I've become a night-life raver, and I'm begging you, please, please, please, oh, please don't you let me down!
Night-life ravers, night-life ravers, night-life ravers!
Oh, please, please, please, please, don't let me down.
Don't let me down!
Don't let me down!
I see ten thousand chariots, and they coming without horses, coming without horses.
The riders they cover their face, so you couldn't make them out in smoky place, in that musical stampede, oh!
It's the musical stampede. 
Ride on!
It's the musical stampede, some preacher say!
People ride on! 
Keep riding!
Keep riding! 
Ride on!
Keep riding!
Midnight ravers!

Keep riding!
Keep riding! 
Ride on!
Keep riding, midnight ravers!
Ride on, you all!
Keep riding!

Keep riding, midnight ravers!

Midnight ravers, don't let me down, keep riding!
Don't let me down.

Keep riding!
Well, I'm coming!
