#We're for the Dark

Tell me the day and I'll set you free, what you want to be.
Show me the way and I'll let you see what you do to me.
Well, it's not enough to live.
If you're going to take, then you have to give.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I.
Show me the clouds and I'll give you sky if you want me to.
Show me the crowds and I'll make you sigh if you take me through.
Well, it's not enough to be.
If you're going to look, then you have to see.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I.
Show me the way and I'll set you free, what you ought to be.
Tell me the day and I'll let you see what you do to me.
Well, it's not enough to live.
If you're going to take, then you have to give.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I.
Show me the clouds and I'll give you sky if you want me to.
Show me the crowds and I'll make you cry if you take me through.
Well, it's not enough to be.
If you gotta look, then you have to see.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I.
