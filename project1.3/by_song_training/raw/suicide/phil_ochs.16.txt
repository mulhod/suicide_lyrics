#One More Parade

Hup, two, three, four, marching down the street, rolling of the drums and the tramping of the feet.
general salutes and the mothers wave and weep.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
One more parade.
So young, so strong, so ready for the war, so willing to go and die upon a foreign shore.
All march together.
everybody looks the same, so there is no one you can blame.
Don't be ashamed.
light the flame.
One more parade.
Listen for the sound and listen for the noise.
Listen for the thunder of the marching boys.
Few years ago their guns were only toys.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
One more parade.
Medals on their coats and guns in their hands.
Trained to kill as they're trained to stand.
Ten thousand ears need only one command.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
One more parade.
Cold hard stares on faces so proud.
Kisses from the girls and cheers from the crowd.
And the widows from the last war cry into their shrouds.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
Don't be ashamed.
war's a game.
World in flames.
So start the parade.
