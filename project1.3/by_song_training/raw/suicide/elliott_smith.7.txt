#Rose Parade

they asked me to come down and watch the parade and to march down the street like the duracell bunny.
with a wink and a wave from the cavalcade, throwing out candy that looks like money to people passing by that all seem to be going the other way.
said won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar.
people were shouting and pushing and saying.
and when i traded a smoke for a food-stamp dollar, a ridiculous marching band started playing and got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song.
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
the trumpet has obviously been drinking because he's fucking up even the simplest lines.
i'd say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing.
it's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine.
and, when they clean the street, i'll be the only shit that's left behind.
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
won't you follow me down to the rose parade?
