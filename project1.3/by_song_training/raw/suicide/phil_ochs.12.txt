#I'm Tired

Sometimes I feel that the world isn't mine.
It feeds on my hunger and tears on my time.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
Every face on the street is as cold as the air, as hard as the pavement moves beneath my feet.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
Sometimes I stop and ask to myself, oh, why should I be so alone?
It comes and it goes and nobody knows for they're blind with a pain all their own.
So I start out again with a smile on my face to hide all the empty and search for a friend.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.

And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
