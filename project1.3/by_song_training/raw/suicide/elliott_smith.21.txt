#St. Ides Heaven

everything is exactly right when i walk around here drunk every night with an open container from 7-11 in st. ides heaven.
i've been out haunting the neighborhood and everybody can see i'm no good when i'm walking out between parked cars with my head full of stars.
high on amphetamines, the moon is a lightbulb breaking.
it'll go around with anyone, but it won't come down for anyone.
you think you know what brings me down, that i want those things you could never allow.
you see me smiling.
you think it's a frown turned upside down because everyone is a fucking pro and they all got answers from trouble they've known and they all got to say what you should and shouldn't do though they don't have a clue.
high on amphetamines, the moon is a lightbulb breaking.
it'll go around with anyone, but it won't come down for anyone and i won't come down for anyone.
