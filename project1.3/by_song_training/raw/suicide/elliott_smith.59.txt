#Going Nowhere

he waved hello, silent like a mime.
there's no changing my mind.
i won't walk the stairs with you tonight going nowhere.
the clock moved a quarter of a turn, the time it took a cigarette to burn.
she said, you got a lot of things to learn going nowhere.
saw you move a certain way, missed you a lot, returned to this abandoned place, should've been forgot.
echoes drown the conversation out, echoes that only seem to bring about a silent expression, things you may allow, going nowhere.
the steps made a pattern i'd never seen.
i felt like a kid of six or seventeen.
i was off in some empty daydream going nowhere.
it's dead and gone, matter of fact.
maybe for the best.
said some things you can't take back honestly, i guess.
the old records sitting on the floor, the ones i can't put on anymore.
he walked over to her like before going nowhere, going nowhere, going nowhere.
