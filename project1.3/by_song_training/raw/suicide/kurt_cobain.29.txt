#Come As You Are

Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be, as a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy.
Take your time.
hurry up.
The choice is yours.
don't be late.
Take a rest as a friend, as an old memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria.
Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be, as a trend, as a friend, as an old memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria.
And I swear that I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
memoria, memoria, memoria.
Memoria, and I don't have a gun
And I swear that I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
Memoria, memoria.
