#Shadowplay

To the centre of the city where all roads meet waiting for you, to the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank searching for you, I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you.
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth. 
In the shadow-play, acting out your own death, knowing no more, as the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor, and with cold steel, odor on their bodies made a move to connect, but I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left. 
I did everything, everything I wanted to.
I let them use you for their own ends.
To the center of the city in the night waiting for you. 
To the center of the city in the night waiting for you.
