#Say Yes

i'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after.
we broke up a month ago and i grew up.
i didn't know i'd be around the morning after.
it's always been wait and see, a happy day and then you pay and feel like shit the morning after.
but now i feel changed around and instead of falling down
 i'm standing up the morning after.
situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later.
and i could be another fool or an exception to the rule.
you tell me the morning after.
crooked spin can't come to rest.
i'm damaged bad at best.
she'll decide what she wants.
i'll probably be the last to know.
no one says until it shows and you see how it is.
they want you or they don't.
say yes.
i'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after.
