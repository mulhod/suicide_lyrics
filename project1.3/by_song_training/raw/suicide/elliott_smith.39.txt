#Can't Make a Sound

i have become a silent movie.
the hero killed the clown.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
nobody knows what he's doing still hanging around.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
the slow motion moves me.
the monologue means nothing to me.
bored in the role, but he can't stop standing up to sit back down or lose the one thing found, spinning the world like a toy top till there's a ghost in every town.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
can't make a sound.
eyes locked and shining.
can't you tell me what's happening?
why should you want any other when you're a world within a world?
why should you want any other when you're a world within a world?
why should you want any other when you're a world within a world?
why should you want any other when you're a world within a world?
