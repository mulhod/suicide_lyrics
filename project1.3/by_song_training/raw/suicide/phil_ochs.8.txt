#I'll Be There

When the river of rebellion overflows, I'll be there.
When the seed of discontent plants and grows, I'll be there, watching for the sun through the dark and rainy storm, searching for the keys to the dungeons old and worn.
Let me tell you.
I'll be there.
When the shadow of the tyrant falls and sweeps across the land, when men would steal from others with paper in their hand, when people search for answers and the answers never come, when their troubles would be over if they thought and fought as one, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
Whispering of yesterday has grown into a roar, winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore.
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
When the thunder of oppression roars and crackles, I'll be there.
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there for the day is going to come when they'll throw away their chains, lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains and let me tell you.
I'll be there.
Whispering of yesterday has turned into a roar, winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore.
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
When the thunder of opression roars and crackles, I'll be there.
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there for the day is going to come when they'll throw away their chains, lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains and let me tell you, let me tell you, let me tell you, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
