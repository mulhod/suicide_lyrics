#King's Crossing

the king's crossing is the main attraction.
dominoes are falling in a chain reaction.
the scraping subject, ruled by fear, told me whiskey works better than beer.
the judge is on vinyl, decisions are final, and nobody gets a reprieve.
and every wave is tidal.
if you hang around, you're going to get wet.
i can't prepare for death any more than i already have.
all you can do now is watch the shells.
the game looks easy.
that's why it sells.
frustrated fireworks inside your head are going to stand and deliver, talk instead.
the method acting that pays my bills keeps a fat man feeding in beverly hills.
i got a heavy-metal mouth that hurls obscenity and i get my check from the trash treasury because i took my own insides out.
it don't matter because i have no sex life.
all i want to do now is inject my ex-wife.
i've seen the movie and i know what happens.
it's christmas time and the needle's on the tree.
a skinny santa is bringing something to me.
his voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred and i only understand every other word.
open your parachute and grab your gun, falling down like an omen, a setting sun.
read the part and return at five.
it's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive, but i don't care if i fuck up.
i'm going on a date with a rich, white lady.
be not life great?
give me one good reason not to do it, so do it.
this is the place where time reverses.
dead men talk to all the pretty nurses.
instruments shine on a silver tray.
don't let me get carried away.
don't let me get carried away.
don't let me be carried away.
