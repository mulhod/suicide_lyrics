#Warsaw

I was there in the backstage when the first light came around.
I grew up like a changeling to win the first time around.
I can see all the weakness.
I pick all the faults.
Well, I concede all the faith tests just to stick in your throats.
31G, 31G, 31G.
I hung around in your soundtrack to mirror all that you've done, to find the right side of reason, to kill the three lies for one.
I can see all the cold facts.
I can see through your eyes.
All this talk made no contact no matter how hard we tried.
31G, 31G, 31G.
I can still hear the footsteps.
I can see only walls.
I slid into your man-traps with no hearing at all.
I just see contradiction, had to give up the fight just to live in the past tense, to make believe you were right.
31G, 31G, 31G.
