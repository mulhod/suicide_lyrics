#Pictures of Me

start, stop and start.
stupid acting smart.
flirting with the flicks.
you say it's just for kicks.
you'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks.
you got yourself to tease and displease.
doors swinging wide, you walked in to hide.
looking at your feet, failure's complete.
saw you and me on the coin-op tv frozen in fear every time we appear.
i'm not surprised and, really, why should i be?
see nothing wrong, see nothing wrong, so sick and tired of all these pictures of me.
completely wrong, totally wrong.
go walking by.
here comes another guy, jailer who sells personal hells who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees.
everybody's dying just to get the disease.
hey, hey, hey, hey, i'm not surprised and, really, why should i be?
see nothing wrong, see nothing wrong, so sick and tired of all these pictures of me.
completely wrong, totally wrong.
i'm not surprised and, really, why should i be?
see nothing wrong, see nothing wrong, so sick and tired of all these pictures of me.
oh, everybody's dying just to get the disease.
everybody's dying just to get the disease.
everybody's dying just to get the disease.
