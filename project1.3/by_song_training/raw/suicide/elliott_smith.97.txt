#A Question Mark

i got a question mark.
i got a need to always take some shot in the dark.
i don't have to make pretend the picture i'm in is totally clear.
you think that all things have a way they ought to appear because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know i don't.
i dream.
don't know what you mean.
panic called you out and took you in, giving you an easy game and letting you win.
you're giving back a little hatred now to the world because it treated you bad, because you couldn't keep the great unknown from making you mad, because you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know i don't.
i dream.
don't know what you mean.
said your final word, but honesty and love could've kept us together.
one day you'll see it's worth it after all.
if you ever want to say you're sorry, you can give me a call.
