#Draft Dodger Rag

Oh, I'm just a typical American boy from a typical American town.
I believe in God and Senator Dodd and keeping old Castro down.
And, when it came my time to serve, I knew "better dead than red".
But, when I got to my old draft board, buddy, this is what I said.
Sarge, I'm only eighteen.
I got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse.
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt.
Besides, I be not no fool, I'm going to school, and I'm working in a defense plant.
I've got a dislocated disc and a wracked-up back.
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs.
And, when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits and I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.
I got the weakness woes.
I can't touch my toes.
I can hardly reach my knees.
And, if the enemy came close to me, I'd probably start to sneeze.
Sarge, I'm only eighteen.
I got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse.
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt.
Besides, I be not no fool, I'm going to school, and I'm working in a defense plant.
Oh, I hate Chou En Lai and I hope he dies.
One thing you got to see, that someone's got to go over there, and that someone isn't me, so I wish you well, Sarge.
give them Hell!
Kill me a thousand or so.
And, if you ever get a war without blood and gore, I'll be the first to go.
Yes, I'm only eighteen.
I got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse.
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt.
Besides, I be not no fool, I'm going to school, and I'm working in a defense plant.
