#Last Hour

here's the army that you mowed to the ground and the bodies you left lying around.
talking it out the last hour.
i'm through trying now.
it's a big relief.
i'll be staying down where no one else going to give me grief, mess me around.
just make it over.
your opinion was the law of the land, a single thing that i couldn't always understand.
i lived it out from hour to hour, the only thing that never really changed.
you ran me all around and dragged me down at the end of the day.
don't keep me around.
just make it over.
i've been thinking of the things that i missed, situations that i passed up for this one-way love i took for ours.
i'm through trying now.
it's a big relief.
i'll be staying down.
i wasn't good at being a thief, more like a clown.
make it over.
