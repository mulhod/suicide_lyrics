#Exercise One

When you're looking at life in a strange new room, maybe drowning soon, is this the start of it all?
Turn on your TV.
Turn down your pulse.
Turn away from it all.
It's all getting too much.
When you're looking at life, deciphering scars.
just who fooled who?
sit still in their cars.
the lights look bright when you reach outside, time for one last ride before the end of it all.
