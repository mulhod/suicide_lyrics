#Ballad of William Worthy

Well, it's of a bold reporter whose story I will tell.
He went down to the Cuban land, the nearest place to hell.
He'd been there many times before, but now the law does say the only way to Cuba is with the C.I.A.
William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door.
Went down to Cuba.
he's not American anymore.
But somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world.
in the free world you must stay.
Five thousand dollars or a five year sentence may well be for a man who had the nerve to think that traveling is free.
Oh, why'd he waste his time to see a dictator's reign when he could have seen democracy by traveling on to Spain?

So, come all you good travelers and fellow travelers too, yes, and travel all around the world, see every country through.
I'd surely like to come along and see what may be new, but my passport's disappearing as I sing these words to you.
Well, there really is no need to travel to these evil lands.
Yes, and, though the list grows larger, you must try to understand.
try hard not to worry if someday you should hear the whole world is off limits.
visit Disneyland this year.
