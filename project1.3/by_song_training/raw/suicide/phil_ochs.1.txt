Do What I Have to Do

All around this country, trouble in the air and I hear the voices calling me, asking, "do you know and do you care?
Do you know and do you care?"
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
Don't want to cause no sorrow.
Don't want to cause no pain.
I'm only going to cause what I have to cause until this land is free of shame, till this land is free of shame.
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
Only one thing I know, I know we're not alone.
Was a million here before we came.
Be a million when we're gone, we're gone, million when we're gone.
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
Oh, I'm afraid of trouble.
yes, I'm afraid of jail.
But I'm more afraid, lord, not to try, more afraid of what happens now if we fail, what happens now if we fail.
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
