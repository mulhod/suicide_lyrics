#Ballad of Big Nothing

throwing candy out to the crowd dragging down the main, the helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who's always got something to say.
you're sitting at home now waiting for your brother to call.
i saw him down at the alley having had enough of it all.
said you can do what you want to whenever you want to.
you can do what you want to.
there's no one to stop you.
all spit and spite, you're up all night and down every day, a tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away, getting in to the back of a car for candy from some stranger, watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger.
you can do what you want to whenever you want to.
you can do what you want to.
there's no one to stop you.
now you can do what you want to whenever you want to, do what you want to whenever you want to, do what you want to whenever you want to though it doesn't mean a thing, big nothing.
