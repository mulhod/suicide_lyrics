#Chords of Fame

I found him by the stage last night.
He was breathing his last breath.
A bottle of gin and a cigarette was all that he had left.
I can see you make the music because you carry a guitar, but, God, help the troubadour who tries to be a star.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
I've seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world.
When they find their melody, they're surrounded by the girls.
But it all fades so quickly, like a sunny summer day.
Reporters ask you questions.
They write down what you say.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
They will rob you of your innocence.
They will put you up for sale.
More that you will find success, the more that you will fail.
I've been around.
I've had my share and I really can't complain, but I wonder who I left behind the other side of fame.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
