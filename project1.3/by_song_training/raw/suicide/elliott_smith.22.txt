#Good to Go

a low-riding junkie girl rode down south to your little world like a dream.
you can do it if you want to, you can do it if you want to, you can do it if you want to be like me.
i wouldn't need a hero if i wasn't such a zero, if i wasn't such a zero.
good to go.
all i ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around.
it's all i ever see around here.
she kicked new york like a curse and you traced her footsteps in reverse up to queens.
you can do it if you want to, you can do it if you want to, you can do it if you want to be like me.
i wouldn't need a hero if i wasn't such a zero, if i wasn't such a zero.
good to go.
all i ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around.
it's all i ever see around here, some empty envelopes from some other town.
it's all i ever see around here, i'm waiting for something that's not coming.
