#Angel in the Snow

i'd say you make a perfect angel in the snow, all crushed out on the way you are.
better stop before it goes too far.
don't you know that i love you?
sometimes i feel like only a cold, still life that fell down here to lay beside you.
don't you know that i love you?
sometimes i feel like only a cold, still life, only a frozen, still life that fell down here to lay beside you.
