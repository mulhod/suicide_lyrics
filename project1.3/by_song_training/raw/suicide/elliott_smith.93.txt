#Waltz #1

Every time the day darkens down and goes away, pictures open in my head of me and you, silent and cliche, all the things we did and didn't say, covered up by what we did and didn't do, going through every out i used to cop to make the repetition stop.
What was I supposed to say?
Now I never leave my zone.
we're both alone.
I'm going home.
I wish I'd never seen your face.
