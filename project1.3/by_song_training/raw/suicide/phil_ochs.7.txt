#Going Down To Mississippi

I'm going down to Mississippi.
I'm going down a southern road and, if you never see me again, remember that I had to go, remember that I had to go.
It's a long road down to Mississippi.
It's a short road back the other way.
If the cops pull you over to the side of the road, you won't have nothing to say.
No, you won't have nothing to say.
There's a man waiting down in Mississippi and he's waiting with a rifle in his hand and he's looking down the road for an out-of-state car and he thinks he's fighting for his land.
Yes, he thinks he's fighting for his land.
And he won't know the clothes I'm wearing and he doesn't know the name that I own, but his gun is large and his hate is hard and he knows I'm coming down the road.
Yes, he knows I'm coming down the road.
It's not for the glory that I'm leaving.
It's not trouble that I'm looking for.
But there's lots of good work calling me down and the waiting won't do no more.
No, the waiting won't do no more.
Don't call me the brave one for going.
No, don't pin a medal to my name for, even if there was any choice to make, I'd be going down just the same, I'd be going down just the same for someone's got to go to mississippi just as sure as there's a right and there's a wrong.
Even though you say the time will change, that time is just too long, that time is just too long.
So I'm going down to Mississippi.
I'm going down a southern road and, if you never see me again, remember that I had to go, remember that I had to go.
