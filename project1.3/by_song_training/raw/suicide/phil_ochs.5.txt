#William Moore

Walking down an Alabama road, remembering what the Bible told, walking with a letter in his hand, dreaming of another southern land.
walking down an Alabama road.
And he went by the name of William Moore.
Now what are you doing William Moore?
Why the letter in your hand?
There's only one southern land and he went by the name of William Moore.
What price the glory of one man?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the hopes?
What price the dreams?
And what price the glory of one man?
Remembering what his grandfather done, fought for the south in '61.
A hundred years have passed by since then.
Now Moore is fighting for the south again, remembering what his grandfather done.
Remembering the time in World War II and the South Pacific Island that he knew, remembering the young men that he killed and praying that the guns of hate be stilled.
Remembering the time in World War Two.
What price the glory of one man?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the hopes?
What price the dreams?
And what price the glory of one man?
And they shot him on the Alabama road, forgot about what the Bible told.
They shot him with that letter in his hand as though he were a dog and not a man.
And they shot him on the Alabama road.
Did you say it was a shame when he died?
Did you say he was fool because he tried?
Did you wonder who had fired the gun?
Did you know that it was you who fired the gun?
Did you say "it was a shame" when he died?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the hopes?
What price the dreams?
And what price the glory of one man?
Walking down an Alabama road.
