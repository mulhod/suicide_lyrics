#Lithium

I'm so happy because today I've found my friends.
They're in my head.
I'm so ugly, but that's okay because so are you.
We've broken our mirrors.
Sunday morning is every day for all I care and I'm not scared.
Light my candles in a daze because I've found god.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm so lonely, but that's okay.
I shaved my head.
And I'm not sad and just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard.
But I'm not sure.
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to meet you there.
But I don't care.
I'm so horny, but that's okay.
My will is good.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I like it.
I'm not going to crack.
I miss you.
I'm not going to crack.
I love you.
I'm not going to crack.
I killed you.
I'm not going to crack.
I like it.
I'm not going to crack.
I miss you.
I'm not going to crack.
I love you.
I'm not going to crack.
I killed you.
I'm not going to crack.
I'm so happy because today I've found my friends.
They're in my head.
I'm so ugly, but that's okay because so are you.
We've broken our mirrors.
Sunday morning is every day for all I care and I'm not scared.
Light my candles in a daze because I've found god.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I like it.
I'm not going to crack.
I miss you.
I'm not going to crack.
I love you.
I'm not going to crack.
I killed you.
I'm not going to crack.
I like it.
I'm not going to crack.
I miss you.
I'm not going to crack.
I love you.
I'm not going to crack.
I killed you.
I'm not going to crack.
