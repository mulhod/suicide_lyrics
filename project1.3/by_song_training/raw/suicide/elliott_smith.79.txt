#Condor Avenue

she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue and she locked the car and slipped past into rhythmic quietude, lights burning, voice dry and hoarse.
i threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth.
the chimes fell over each other.
i fell onto my knees.
the sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased,
a sick shouting like you hear at the fairground.
now i'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around.
i don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters.
it'll make a whisper out of you.
she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue.
the fairground's lit, a drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through, got his hat tipped, bottle back in between his teeth.
looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach.
i can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake to take a little nap while the road is straight.
i wish that car had never been discovered.
they took away the bottle and the hat he was under.
that's the one thing that he could never do and it'll make a whisper out of you.
she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue.
cops were running around the scene, looking for some kind of clue.
they never get uptight when a moth gets crushed, unless a lightbulb really loved him very much.
i'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette, little whisper smoke-signs that you'll never get.
you're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon, headlights burning bright ahead of you.
and someone's burning out, out on condor avenue, trying to make a whisper out of you.
what a shitty thing to say.
did you really mean it?
you never said a word to me about what passed between us, so now i'm leaving you alone.
you can do whatever the hell you want to.
