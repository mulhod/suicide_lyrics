Apple of My Eye

Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away though inside my heart, I really want to stay.
Believe the love we have is so sincere.
You know, the gift you have will always be.
You're the apple of my eye.
You're the apple of my heart, but now the time has come to part.
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to make a stand though we never meant to bite the loving hand.
And now the time has come to walk alone.
We were the children.
now we've overgrown.
You're the apple of my eye.
You're the apple of my heart, but now the time has come to part.
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away though inside my heart, I really want to stay.
Believe the love we have is so sincere.
You know, the gift you have will always be.
You're the apple of my eye.
You're the apple of my heart, but now the time has come to part.
Now the time has come to part.
Now the time has come to part.
