#Blodwyn

I put away the knife, the chisel, and the saw.
I've locked away my life behind this old oak door to make a simple spoon, a token of my love in hope that maybe soon it's me you're thinking of.
So take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn.
The valley knows the way I feel today.
So take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn, before some other spoon takes you away.
My life may not be long, was working down below for so much can go wrong, but what else do I know?
So take these precious years and make them precious too and say you'll take from me what I will give to you.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn.
The valley knows the way I feel today.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn, before some other spoon takes you away.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn.
Valley knows the way I feel today.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn, before some other spoon takes you away.
