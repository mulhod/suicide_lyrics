#Drive All Over Town

two-dollar color pictures from a photo booth, dirty, stepped on, lying out on the floor of their room.
faces fell long in the half-light.
he looks all wrong, but that's her alright.
look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight.
he knew the one time with the army captain he got one that whole deal before it happened, said it's okay, i knew exactly what you meant when you said you were an accident.
but, when it's 3 am, he wonders where in the hell she went and he'll drive all over town, drive all over town, and he'll drive all over town, drive all over town.
until he tracks her down, he'll drive all over town.
