#A.M.A. Song

We are the nation's physicians.
Yes, we give to our lobbies every day.
We will fight against disease when the money comes with ease and, when we get together, we say, "Hooray for A.M.A. and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way.
We've divided up the sections of the body.
Every day we specialize more and more.
But we really love to stitch the diseases of the rich.
We are sure there is a clinic for the poor.
Hooray for the A.M.A and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way and our waiting rooms are getting pretty crowded.
It is sad to see our patients sit and bleed, but, if you must use our ointment, then you must have an appointment or who'll pay for those magazines you read?
Hooray for the A.M.A and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay, higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way and now the government is getting too ambitious.
Yes, we know they want to socialize us all.
Well, our oath was Hippocratic, but with money we're fanatic, so we'll see you in Canada in the fall.
Hooray for the A.M.A. and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way.
AMALGAMATED A.M.A.
