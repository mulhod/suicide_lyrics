#Punch and Judy

a wallflower punch talks to judy in a crowded corner where anybody can listen in, but they don't read page to page or speak easy.
now they're going to go say the words in the wrong order again.
they walk in a circle through all the sidewalk scenes they used to be a part of one time.
now everybody just stares and whispers, driving around up and down division street.
i used to like it here.
it just bums me out to remember.
can't you ever treat anyone nice?
i think i'm going to make the same mistake twice.
they draw the curtain, wait for a call.
pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all.
can't you ever treat anyone nice?
i think i'm going to make the same mistake twice.
i'm going to make the same mistake twice.
