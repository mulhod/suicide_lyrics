#Song of my Returning

The wild geese are dancing in the ripples of the morn.
My wanderlust is formed.
I've got to follow them wherever they may lead for I am just a sailor on a ship across the land.
Let me hold your hand to bid farewell, so i can knuckle to my
 knee.
but I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the early song of my returning.
The weary world is waiting for ambition to be played, now young and not afraid.
I've got to challenge every chalice that I know.
My eager ears are listening for the singing of the sign.
Deeper are the lines upon the face that finds reflections in the road.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the changing song of my returning.
My drifting days prepare me to do battle with the night, a phantom of the fight.
I've got to conquer all the courage of my fears.
The answer lies in limbo and the harvest will be hard, but sacred are the scars that leave their mark on the fast disolving years.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the changing song of my returning.
Time must have her victory.
It's that I've always known.
But I won or lost alone.
and, when a voice calls out, "there's someone you must meet", with every strength remaining I will suffer one more scene.
I'll gather all my dreams and with my final breath I'll lay them at your feet.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the changing song of my returning.
