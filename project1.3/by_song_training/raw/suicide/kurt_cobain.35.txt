#Lounge Act

Truth covered in security.
I can't let you smother me.
I'd like to, but it couldn't work.
Trading off and taking turns, I don't regret a thing and I've got this friend, you see,
 who makes me feel and I wanted more than I could steal.
I'll arrest myself.
I'll wear a shield.
I'll go out of my way to prove I still, I still smell her on you.
Don't tell me what I want to hear.
Afraid of never knowing fear.
Experience anything you need.
I'll keep fighting jealousy until it's fucking gone.
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel and I wanted more than I could steal.
I'll arrest myself.
I'll wear a shield.
I'll go out of my way to prove I still, I still smell her on you.

I'll arrest myself.
I'll wear a shield.
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal.
We've made a pact to learn from whoever we want without new rules.
We'll share what's lost and what we grew.
They'll go out of their way to prove they still, still smell her on you, still smell her on you, still smell her on you.
