#Get Down

Get down, baby, get down.
Get down to my heart.
Be around, baby, be around.
Be around when I call.
You say your name is Mary, but I got my point of view.
Got the time to show you that it's true.
Yes, I do.
Thrill me, baby.
Come on.
Way down to my feet.
Get down, baby, get down.
Get down to my heart.
You say your name is Mary, but I got my point of view.
I got the time to show you that it's true.
Yes, I do.
Get down.
