#No Matter What

No matter what you are I will always be with you.
Doesn't matter what you do, girl.
Oh, girl, with you.
No matter what you do I will always be around.
Won't you tell me what you found, girl?
Oh, girl, won't you?
Knock down the old gray wall and be a part of it all.
Nothing to say.
nothing to see.
nothing to do.
If you would give me all as I would give it to you, nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be.
No matter where you go there will always be a place.
Can't you see it in my face, girl?
Oh, girl, want you.
Knock down the old gray wall.
Be a part of it all.
Nothing to say.
nothing to see.
nothing to do.
If you would give me all as I would give it to you, nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be.
No matter what you are I will always be with you.
Doesn't matter what you do, girl.
Oh, girl, with you.
Oh, girl, you girl.
Want you.
Oh, girl, you girl.
Want you.
