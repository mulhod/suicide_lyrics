#Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Me

Every morning at the dawn dust is in the air.
Karen rises early, runs brushes through her hair.
Then she buys the paper.
I lay on my back.
Then she feeds the monkey.
then she feeds the cat.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
Frances is the next to rise.
Powders up her nose.
She's working for the tailor.
Makes the western clothes.
Andy drives a sports car to the Warner Brothers ghost.
He used to live in England.
Now he loves the coast.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
Sometimes a friend comes by to sing the latest song, but David fights with Susan.
Nobody gets along.
Every other Sunday it's time to make a call.
Judy has a barbecue.
Play the volleyball.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
In the evening when the sun goes down, the streets are all aglow.
We walk out on the hillside.
City shines below.
We sit down for our supper.
The news begins to play.
Walter, he is speechless.
Eric speaks cliches.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
Andy plays a cricket game.
Frances holds a glass.
Karen reads and darns a dress.
I dream of the past.
Dark is spreading up now.
Good evening, goodnight.
Karen turns the bed sheet.
She's turning out the light.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
