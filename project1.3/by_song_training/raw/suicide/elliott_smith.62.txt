#First Timer

i'm a first timer, wishing i was someone else when i see you by yourself in a corridor where you find yourself now blocked by a door you locked.
you won't do what the doctor ordered.
you won't see someone else.
come on back to me, my bright tomorrow.
you say you feel hollow and you know it's because you are, well, at least so far.
i think of you with hesitation.
i think of you too hard.
come on back to me, but don't make me sorry.
i'm a first timer, wishing i'd been someone else, seeing you by yourself, seeing you by yourself.
