#The Trial

Outside the cats are scratching.
Inside the doors are latching.
On the room, the greedy gloom, the trial is revealed.
Police are six feet deep with switchblades in their teeth, so no one leaves and they all believe this is absolutely real.
Yes, it's real.
And the sergeant says, "Are you ready, boys?
Get ready, boys.
Aim and fire."
Order in the court.
People ready for the sport.
They squirm and squeak and lick their beaks and grease their feathers down.
Everybody rise.
Judge is here with bathroom eyes.
A grizzly bear, he hugs his chair and the greedy gavel pounds.
Yes, it pounds.
And the sergeant says, "Are you ready, boys?
Get ready, boys.
Aim and fire."
In the dungeon falls, writing appeals upon the wall, and the priest in prayers is not even there, so precious is his time.
To the stake he's tied.
The swallows sing.
the triggers slide.
He bids goodbye to the watery sky that plunges from his mind, from his mind.
And the sergeant says, "Are you ready, boys?
Get ready, boys.
Aim and fire."
