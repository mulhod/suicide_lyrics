#Aero Zeppelin

What's a season in a right if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything?
What's the meaning in a crime?
it's a fan if anything.
Where's the learning in a line?
it's a brand.
it's a brand.
How a culture comes again.
it was all here yesterday and you swear it's not a trend.
doesn't matter anyway.
There's only here to talk to friends.
nothing new is every day.
You could shit upon the stage.
they'll be fans.
They'll be fans.
They'll be fans.
They'll be fans.
All the kids will eat it up if it's packaged properly.
Steal a sound and imitate.
keep a format equally, not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays.
An idea is what we lack.
it doesn't matter anyways.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
