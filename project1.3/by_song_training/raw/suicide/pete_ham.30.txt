#Perfection

There is no real perfection.
There'll be no perfect day.
Just love is our connection, the truth in what we say.
There's no good revolution, just power changing hands.
There is no straight solution, except to understand.
So listen to my song of life.
You don't need a gun or a knife.
Successful conversation will take you very far.
There is no real perfection.
There'll be no perfect man.
Just peace is our connection, forgiving all you can.
There's no good kind of killing, just power taking life.
It's all good blood that's spilling to make a bigger knife.
So listen to my song of life.
You don't need a gun or a knife.
Successful conversation will take you very far.
Successful conversations will take you very far.
So listen to my song of life.
You don't need a gun or a knife.
Successful conversation will take you very far.
Successful conversations will take you very far.
Successful conversations will take you very far.
