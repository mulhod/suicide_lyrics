#My Kingdom for a Car

I've found my freedom.
Her and I been flying down that highway of gold.
My shirtsleeves are rolled.
my Colt 45 is cold.
I go fast till I'm going faster.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
How I love the highway.
Picks me up and takes me wherever I please.
I race through the trees, bring space to her knees.
I am master of all that's flying past me.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
Take me to tomorrow.
Let me go on racing with the wind in my hair.
There's smoke in the air, but I do not care.
If you want me, you will have to pass me.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
Come to me, baby.
We will leave this town.
it was not made for a man.
We'll find a new land, but the traffic is jammed.
I went far, but it's a time for walking.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
