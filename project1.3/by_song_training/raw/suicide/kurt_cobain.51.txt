#Big Long Now

It's not cold enough.
Please put this side up.
She is moving through.
Can we show our faces now?
I'm not interesting.
She's not turning green, shameful as it seems.
Can we show our faces now?
Endless climb.
I am blind.
Why can't I leave?
Color-blind.
Speaking a phrase.
Instantly grown.
I am blind, waiting in line.
It's not cold enough.

Can we show our faces now?
Endless climb.
I am blind.
Why can't I leave?
Color-blind.
Speaking a phrase.
Instantly grown.
I am blind.
Why am I sure?
