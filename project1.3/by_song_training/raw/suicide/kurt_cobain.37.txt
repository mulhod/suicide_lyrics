#On A Plain

I'll start this off without any words.
I got so high that I scratched till I bled.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I ever had was when I learned to cry on command.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
My mother died every night, it's safe to say.
don't quote me on that.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again, forgot to put on the zip code.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
Somewhere I have heard this before, in a dream of memory restored.
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed.
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear, to write off lines that don't make sense.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
And one more special message to go and then I'm done.
then I can go home.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
