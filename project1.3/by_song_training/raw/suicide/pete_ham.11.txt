#Carry on Till Tomorrow

In younger days, I told myself my life would be my own and I'd leave the place where sunshine never shone for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the rising sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on till tomorow.
there's no reason to look back.
Carry on, carry on, carry on beyond the shadows of the clouds and onward to the sky.
Carry on till I find the rainbow's end for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the rising sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on till tomorow.
there's no reason to look back.
Carry on, carry on, carry on.
Drifting on the wings of freedom, leave this stormy day and we'll ride to tomorrow's golden fields for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the rising sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on.
And, when the heavy journey's done, I'll rest my weary head for the world and its colours will be mine for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the setting sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on till tomorow.
there's no reason to look back.
Carry on, carry on, carry on.
