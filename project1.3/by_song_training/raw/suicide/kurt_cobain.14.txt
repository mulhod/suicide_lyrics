#Serve The Servants

Teenage angst has paid off well.
Now I'm bored and old.
Self-appointed judges judge more than they have sold.
If she floats, then she is not a witch like we had thought.
A down payment on another one at salem's lot.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
That legendary divorce is such a bore.
As my bones grew they did hurt.
They hurt really bad.
I tried hard to have a father, but instead I had a dad.
I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore.
There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
That legendary divorce is such a bore.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
That legendary divorce is such a bore.
