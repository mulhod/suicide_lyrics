#No Name #5

got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past and everybody's gone at last.
a sweet, sweet smile that's fading fast because everybody's gone at last.
and you don't get upset about it, no not anymore.
there's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before.
had a second alone with a chance let pass and everybody's gone at last.
well, i hope you're not waiting, waiting around for me because i'm not going anywhere, obviously.
got a broken heart and your name on my cast and everybody's gone at last.
everybody's gone at last.
