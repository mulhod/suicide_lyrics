#Without You

Well, I can't forget this evening and your face when you were leaving, but I guess that's just the way the story goes.
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows.
Yes, it shows.
Well, I can't forget tomorrow when I think of all my sorrow.
I had you there, but then I let you go and now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.

I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
