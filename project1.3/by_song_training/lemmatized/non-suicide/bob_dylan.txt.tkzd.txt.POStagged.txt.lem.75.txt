#if not for you if not for you , babe , i can n't find the door , can n't even see the floor . 
i 'd be sad and blue if not for you . 
if not for you , babe , i 'd lie awake all night , wait for the morning light to shine in through . 
but it will not be new if not for you . 
if not for you , me sky will fall , rain will gather , too . 
without you love i 'd be nowhere at all . 
i 'd be lose if not for you and you know it 's true . 
if not for you , me sky will fall , rain will gather , too . 
without you love i 'd be nowhere at all . 
oh , what will i do if not for you ? 
if not for you winter will have no spring , i can n't hear the robin sing , i just will n't have a clue . 
anyway , it will n't ring true if not for you , if not for you , if not for you , if not for you , if not for you .
