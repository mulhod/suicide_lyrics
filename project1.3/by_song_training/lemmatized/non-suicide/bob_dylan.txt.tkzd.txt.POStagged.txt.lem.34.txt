#shelter from the storm 'twas in another lifetime , one of toil and blood , when blackness be a virtue , the road be full of mud .

in a world of steel-eyed death and man who be fight to be warm , " come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm .

there be little risk involve . 
everything up to this point have be leave unresolved . 
try imagine a place where it 's always safe and warm . 
" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" i be burn out from exhaustion , bury in the hail , poison in the bush and blow out on the trail , hunt like a crocodile , ravage in the corn . 
" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" suddenly i turn around and he be stand there with silver bracelet on he wrist and flower in he hair . 
he walk up to me so gracefully and take me crown of thorn . 
" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" now there 's a wall between we . 
something there 's be lose . 
i take too much for grant . 
i get me signal cross . 
just to think this it all begin on a non-eventful morn . 
" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" well , the deputy walk on hard nail and the preacher ride a mount , but nothing really matter much .

"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" i 've hear newborn baby wail like a mourn dive and old man with break teeth , strand without love . 
do i understand you question , man ?

" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" in a little hilltop village they gamble for me clothe . 
i bargain for salvation and he give me a lethal dose . 
i offer up me innocence . 
i get repay with scorn . 
" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . 
" well , i 'm live in a foreign country , but i 'm bind to cross the line .

some day i 'll make it me . 
if i can only turn back the clock to when god and he be bear . 
" come in , " he say . 
"i'll give you shelter from the storm .
