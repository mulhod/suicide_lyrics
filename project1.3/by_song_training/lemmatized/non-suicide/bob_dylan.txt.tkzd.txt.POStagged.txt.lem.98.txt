#you angel you you angel , you , you get me under you wing . 
the way you walk and the way you talk i feel i can almost sing . 
you angel , you , you 're as fine as anything 's fine . 
i just walk and watch you talk with you memory on me mind . 
and , though i ca n't sleep at night for try , yes , i never do feel this way before , never do get up and walk the floor . 
if this be love , then give me more and more and more and more and more . 
you angel , you , you 're as fine as can be . 
the way you walk and the way you talk be the way it ought to be . 
and , though i ca n't sleep at night for try , never do feel this way before , never do get up and walk the floor . 
if this be love , then give me more and more and more and more . 
you angel , you , you get me under you wing . 
the way you walk and the way you talk , i swear , it will make me sing .
