# the time they be a-changin' come gather around , people , wherever you roam and admit this the water around you have grow and accept it , this soon you 'll be drench to the bone .

the battle outside , rage , will soon shake you window and rattle you wall for the time , they be change . 
come , mother and father throughout the land , and do n't criticize what you ca n't understand . 
you son and you daughter be beyond you command .
