#bob dylan 's dream while ride on a train go west , i fall asleep for to take me rest . 
i dream a dream this make me sad , concern me and the first few friend i have . 
with half-damp eye i stare to the room , where me friend and i spend many an afternoon , where we together weather many a storm , laugh and sing till the early hour of the morn . 
by the old wooden stave where we hat be hang , we word be tell , we song be sing , where we long for nothing and be satisfy , joke and talk about the world outside . 
with hungry heart through the heat and cold , we never much think we can get very old . 
we think we can sit forever in fun . 
we chance really be a million to one . 
as easy it be to tell black from white , it be all this easy to tell wrong from right . 
and we choice , they be few , so the think never hit this the one road we travel will ever shatter or split . 
how many a year have pass and go , many a gamble have be lose and win , and many a road take by many a first friend and each one i 've never see again ? 
i wish , i wish , i wish in vain this we can sit simply in this room again . 
ten thousand dollar at the drop of a hat , i 'd give it all gladly if we life can be like this .
