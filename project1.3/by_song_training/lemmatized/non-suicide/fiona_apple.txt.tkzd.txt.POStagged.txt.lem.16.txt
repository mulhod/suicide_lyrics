#criminal i 've be a bad , bad girl . 
i 've be careless with a delicate man . 
and it 's a sad , sad world when a girl will break a boy just because he can . 
do n't you tell me to deny it . 
i 've do wrong and i want to suffer for me sin . 
i 've come to you because i need guidance to be true and i just do n't know where i can begin . 
what i need be a good defense because i 'm feel like a criminal , and i need to be redeem to the one i 've sin against because he 's all i ever know of love . 
heaven help me for the way i be . 
save me from this evil deed before i get they do . 
i know tomorrow bring the consequence at hand . 
but i keep live this day like the next will never come . 
oh help me but do n't tell me to deny it . 
i 've get to cleanse me of all this lie till i 'm good enough for he . 
i 've get a lot to lose , and i 'm bet high , so i 'm beg you before it end just tell me where to begin . 
what i need be a good defense because i 'm feel like a criminal , and i need to be redeem to the one i 've sin against because he 's all i ever know of love . 
let me know the way before there 's hell to pay . 
give me room to lie the law and let me go . 
i 've get to make a play to make me lover stay . 
so what will an angel say ? 
the devil want to know . 
what i need be a good defense because i 'm feel like a criminal , and i need to be redeem to the one i 've sin against because he 's all i ever know of love . 
what i need be a good defense because i 'm feel like a criminal , and i need to be redeem to the one i 've sin against because he 's all i ever know of love .
