and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it can 've be me . 
i have me a good girl , he kiss sweet than wine . 
and i have always hope this someday i 'd make he me . 
but he run off and marry , this 's just the way it 's suppose to be .

well the junkie cop on first street , stick a needle in he arm .

but he 's bury six foot deep , this 's just the way it 's suppose to be . 
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it can 've be me . 
i have me a good girl , he kiss sweet than wine . 
and i have always hope this someday i 'd make he me . 
bus he run off and marry , this 's just the way it 's suppose to be . 
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't you know it can 've be me .
