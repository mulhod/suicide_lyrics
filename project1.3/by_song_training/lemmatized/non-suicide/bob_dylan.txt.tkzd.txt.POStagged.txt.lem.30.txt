#you're go to make me lonesome when you go i 've see love go by me door . 
it 's never be this close before . 
never be so easy or so slow . 
i be shoot in the dark too long . 
when something 's not right , it 's wrong . 
you 're go to make me lonesome when you go . 
dragon cloud so high above , i 've only know careless love . 
it always have hit me from below , but this time around it 's more correct , right on target , so direct . 
you 're go to make me lonesome when you go . 
purple clover , queen anne lace , crimson hair across you face , you can make me cry if you do n't know . 
ca n't remember what i be think of . 
you may be spoil me too much , love . 
you 're go to make me lonesome when you go . 
flower on the hillside bloom crazy , cricket talk back and forth in rhyme , blue river run slow and lazy , i can stay with you forever and never realize the time . 
situation have end sad . 
relationship have all be bad . 
me 've be like verlaine 's and rimbaud 's , but there 's no way i can compare all they scene to this affair . 
you 're go to make me lonesome when you go . 
you 're go to make me wonder what i 'm do , stay far behind without you . 
you 're go to make me wonder what i 'm say . 
you 're go to make me give me a good talking-to . 
i 'll look for you in old honolulu , san francisco , or ashtabula . 
you 're go to have to leave me now , i know . 
but i 'll see you in the sky above , in the tall grass , in the one i love . 
you 're go to make me lonesome when you go .
