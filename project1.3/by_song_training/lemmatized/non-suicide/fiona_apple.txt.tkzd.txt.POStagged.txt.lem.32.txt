#i know so be it . 
i 'm you crowbar if this 's what i be so far , until you get out of this mess . 
and i will pretend this i dont know of you sin until you be ready to confess . 
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know . 
and you can use me skin to bury secret in , and i will settle you down . 
and at me own suggestion , i will ask no question while i do me thing in the background . 
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know . 
baby , i ca n't help you out while he 's still around . 
so for the time be , i 'm be patient . 
and amidst this bitterness , if you 'll just consider this , even if it do n't make sense all the time , give it time . 
and when the crowd become you burden , and you 've early close you curtain , i 'll wait by the backstage door while you try to find the line to speak you mind and pry it open , hope for an encore . 
and if it get too late , for me to wait for you to find you love me and tell me so , it 's okay , dont need to say it .
