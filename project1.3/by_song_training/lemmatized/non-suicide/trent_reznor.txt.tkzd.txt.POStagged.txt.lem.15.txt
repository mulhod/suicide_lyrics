# the only time i 'm drink , and right now i 'm so in love with you . 
and i do n't want to think too much about what we should or should n't do . 
lie me hand on heaven and the sun and the moon and the star , while the devil want to fuck me in the back of he car . 
nothing quite like the feel of something new . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up in you . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up in you . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
this be the only time i really feel alive . 
this be the only time i really feel alive . 
i swear , i just find everything i need . 
the sweat in you eye the blood in you vein be listen to me . 
well i want to drink it up and swim in it until i drown , me immoral stand be lie down . 
nothing quite like the feel of something new . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up in you . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up . 
maybe i 'm all mess up in you . 
maybe i 'm all mess up .
