#do n't think twice , it 's alright well , it be not no use to sit and wonder why , babe , if you do n't know by now . 
and it be not no use to sit and wonder why , babe . 
it 'll never do , somehow . 
when you rooster crow at the break of dawn , look out you window and i 'll be go . 
you 're the reason i 'm travel on , but do n't think twice . 
it 's alright . 
and it be not no use in turn on you light , babe , the light i never knowed . 
and it be not no use in turn on you light , babe . 
i 'm on the dark side of the road . 
but i wish there be something you will do or say to try and make me change me mind and stay , but we never do too much talk anyway . 
but do n't think twice . 
it 's alright . 
so , it be not no use in call out me name , gal , like you never do before . 
and it be not no use in call out me name , gal . 
i ca n't hear you anymore . 
i 'm think and wonder , walk down the road . 
i once love a woman , a child , i be tell . 
i give he me heart , but he want me soul . 
but do n't think twice . 
it 's alright . 
so long , honey babe . 
where i 'm bind i ca n't tell . 
goodbye 's too good a word , babe , so i 'll just say , "fare you well . 
" i be not say you treat me unkind . 
you can 've do well , but i do n't mind . 
you just kind of waste me precious time , but do n't think twice . 
it 's alright .
