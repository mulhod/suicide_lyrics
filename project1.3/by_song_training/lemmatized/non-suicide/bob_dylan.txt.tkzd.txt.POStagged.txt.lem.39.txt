#love minus zero no limit me love , he speak like silence , without ideal or violence . 
he do n't have to say he 's faithful . 
yet he 's true like ice , like fire . 
people carry rose and make promise by the hour . 
me love , he laugh like the flower . 
valentine ca n't buy he . 
in the dimestores and bus-stations people talk of situation , read book , repeat quotation , draw conclusion on the wall . 
some speak of the future . 
me love , he speak softly . 
he know there 's no success like failure and this failure 's no success at all . 
the cloak and dagger dangle . 
madam light the candle . 
in ceremony of the horseman even the pawn must hold a grudge . 
statue make of matchstick crumble into one another . 
me love wink . 
he do not bother . 
he know too much to argue or to judge . 
the bridge at midnight tremble . 
the country doctor ramble . 
banker ' niece seek perfection , expect all the gift this wise man bring . 
the wind howl like a hammer and the night blow rainy . 
me love , he 's like some raven at me window with a break wing .
