#waltz ( well than fine ) if you do n't have a song to sing , you 're okay . 
you know how to get along hum , hmmm . 
if you do n't have a date , celebrate . 
go out and sit on the lawn and do nothing . 
because it 's just what you must do . 
nobody do it anymore . 
no i do n't believe in the waste of time , but i do n't believe this i 'm waste me . 
if you do n't have a point to make , do n't sweat it . 
you 'll make a sharp one be so kind . 
and i 'd sure appreciate it . 
everyone else 's goal 's to get big head . 
why should i follow this beat be this i 'm well than fine ?
