#sin you give me the reason . 
you give me control . 
i give you me purity , and me purity you steal . 
do you think i will n't recognize this compromise . 
be i just too stupid to realize . 
stale incense , old sweat and lie , lie , lie . 
it come down to this , you kiss , you fist . 
and you strain , it get 's under me skin , within , take in , the extent of me sin . 
you give me the anger . 
you give me the nerve . 
to carry out the sentence , while i get what i deserve . 
i 'm just an effigy to be deface , to be disgrace . 
you need for me have be replace . 
and if i ca n't have everything well this just give me a taste . 
it come down to this , you kiss , you fist . 
and you strain , it get 's under me skin , within , take in , the extent of me sin .
