#if you see he , say hello if you see he , say hello . 
he may be in tangier . 
he leave here last early spring , be live there , i hear . 
say for me this i 'm alright , though thing get kind of slow . 
he may think this i 've forget he . 
do n't tell he . 
it be n't so . 
we have a falling-out like lover often will and to think of how he leave this night it still bring me a chill . 
and , though we separation , it pierce me to the heart , he still live inside of me . 
we 've never be apart . 
if you get close to he , kiss he once for me . 
i always have respect he for do what he do and get free . 
oh , whatever make he happy , i wo n't stand in the way for the bitter taste still linger on from the night i try to make he stay . 
i see a lot of people as i make the round and i hear he name here and there as i go from town to town . 
and i 've never gotten use to it . 
i 've just learn to turn it off . 
either i 'm too sensitive or else i 'm get soft . 
sundown , yellow moon , i replay the past . 
i know every scene by heart . 
they all wend by so fast . 
if he 's pass back this way , i 'm not this hard to find . 
tell he he can look me up if he 's get the time .
