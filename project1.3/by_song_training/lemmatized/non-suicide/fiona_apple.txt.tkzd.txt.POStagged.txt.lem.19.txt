#never be a promise you 'll never see the courage i know . 
it color ' richness wo n't appear within you view . 
i 'll never glow the way this you glow . 
you presence dominate the judgement make on you , but as the scenery grow , i see in different light the shade and shadow undulate in me perception . 
me feeling swell and stretch . 
i see from great height . 
i understand what i be still too proud to mention to you . 
you 'll say you understand , but you do n't understand . 
you 'll say you 'd never give up see eye to eye , but never be a promise and you ca n't afford to lie . 
you 'll never touch this thing this i hold . 
the skin of me emotion lie beneath me own . 
you 'll never feel the heat of this soul . 
me fever burn me deep than i 've ever show to you . 
you 'll say : do n't fear you dream . 
it 's easy than it seem . 
you 'll say you 'd never let me fall from hope so high , but never be a promise and you ca n't afford to lie . 
you 'll never live the life this i live . 
i 'll never live the life this wake me in the night . 
you 'll never hear the message i give . 
you 'll say it look as though i may give up this fight , but as the scenery grow , i see in different light the shade and shadow undulate in me perception . 
me feeling swell and stretch . 
i see from great height . 
i realise what i be now too smart to mention to you . 
you 'll say you understand . 
you 'll never understand . 
i 'll say i 'll never wake up know how or why . 
i do n't know what to believe in . 
you wo n't know who i be . 
you 'll say i need appease when i start to cry , but never be a promise and i 'll never need a lie .
