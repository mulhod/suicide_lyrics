#love ride love ride , i 've look at you with the focus i give to me birthday candle . 
i 've wish on the lidded blue flame under you brow . 
and baby , i wish for you . 
nobody see when you be lie in you be , and i want to crawl in with you , but i cry instead . 
i want you warm , but it will only make me cold when it 's over . 
so i ca n't tonight , baby . 
no , not "baby " anymore . 
if i need you , i 'll just use you simple name . 
only kiss on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave . 
me hand wo n't hold you down no more . 
the path be clearly to follow through . 
i stand too long in the way of the door mp fiona apple , and now i 'm give up on you . 
no , not "baby " anymore . 
if i need you , i 'll just use you simple name . 
only kiss on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave . 
no , not "baby " anymore . 
if i need you , i 'll just use you simple name . 
only kiss on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .
