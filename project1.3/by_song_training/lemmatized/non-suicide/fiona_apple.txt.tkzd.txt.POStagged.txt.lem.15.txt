#shadowboxer once me lover , now me friend . 
what a cruel thing to pretend . 
what a cunning way to condescend . 
once me lover , and now me friend . 
oh , you creep up like the cloud and you set me soul at ease . 
then you let you love abound and you bring me to me knee . 
oh , it 's evil , babe , the way you let you grace enrapture me . 
when will you know i 'd be insane to ever let this dirty game recapture me . 
you make me a shadowboxer , baby . 
i want to be ready for what you do . 
i 've be swing all around me because i do n't know when you 're go to make you move . 
oh , you gaze be dangerous , and you fill you space so sweet . 
if i let you get too close you 'll set you spell on me . 
so darling i just want to say , just in case i do n't come through , i be on to every play . 
i just want you . 
but , oh , it 's so evil , me love , the way you 've no reverence to me concern . 
so i 'll be sure to stay wary of you , love , to save the pain of once me flame and twice me burn . 
you make me a shadowboxer , baby . 
i want to be ready for what you do . 
i 've be swing all around me because i do n't know when you 're go to make you move .
