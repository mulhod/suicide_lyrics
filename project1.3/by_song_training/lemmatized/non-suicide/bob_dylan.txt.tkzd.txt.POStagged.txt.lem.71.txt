#one more night one more night the star be in sight , but tonight i 'm as lonesome as can be . 
oh , the moon be shine bright , light everything in sight , but tonight no moonlight will shine on me . 
oh , it 's shameful and it 's sad . 
i lose the only pal i have . 
i just can not be what he want me to be . 
i will turn me head up high to this dark and roll sky for tonight no moonlight will shine on me . 
i be so mistake when i think this he 'd be true . 
i have no idea what a woman in love will do . 
one more night i will wait for the light while the wind blow high above the tree . 
oh , i miss me darling so . 
i do n't mean to see he go , but tonight no moonlight will shine on me . 
one more night the moon be shine bright and the wind blow high above the tree . 
oh , i miss this woman so . 
i do n't mean to see he go , but tonight no moonlight will shine on me .
