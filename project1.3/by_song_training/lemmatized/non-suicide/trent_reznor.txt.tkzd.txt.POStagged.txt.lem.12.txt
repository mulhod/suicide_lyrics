#kinda i want to i ca n't shake this feel from me head . 
there 's a devil sleep in me be . 
he 's watch you from across the way . 
i can make this feel go away . 
i know it 's not the right thing , and i know it 's not the good thing but kinda i want to . 
i 'm not sure of what i should do when everything i 'm think of be you . 
all of me excuse turn to lie . 
maybe god will cover up he eye i know it 's not the right thing , and i know it 's not the good thing but kinda i want to . 
and i want to , maybe just for tonight . 
we can pretend it 's alright . 
what 's the price i pay ? 
i do n't care what they say . 
i want to . 
i want to .
