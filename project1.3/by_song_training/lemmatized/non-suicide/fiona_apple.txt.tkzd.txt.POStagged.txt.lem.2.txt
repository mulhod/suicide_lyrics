#get he back one man , he disappoint me . 
he give me the gouge and he take me glee . 
now every other man i see remind me of the one man who disappoint me . 
but wait till i get he back . 
he wo n't have a back to scratch . 
yeah , keep turn this chin and you will see me face as i figure how to kill what i can catch . 
so i say , and on i go to another one to disappoint me so . 
next one up , a contemptible snob . 
he live to put thing in they place . 
he do a commendable job . 
he put he so low , he can hardly even look me in the face . 
o , he make me blood just burn . 
i flip so far , i think this i will not return . 
but the last one i have who be get me hope up , i may 've be a little fast to dismiss . 
i think he let me down , when he do n't disappoint me . 
he do n't always guess right , but he usually get me gist . 
so wait till i get he back . 
i 'm go to bring he home , and i 'll watch he unpack . 
yeah keep turn this chin , and you will see me face be fix on the one i 'm go to get back . 
i 'm go to get he back , i be . 
i 'm go to get he back , i really be .
