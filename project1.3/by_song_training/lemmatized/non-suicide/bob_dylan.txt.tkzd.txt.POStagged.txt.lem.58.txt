" #i dream i see st . 
augustine i dream i see saint augustine alive as you or me , tear through this quarter in the utmost misery with a blanket underneath he arm and a coat of solid gold , search for the very soul who already have be sell . 
"arise , arise ! 
" he cry so loud with a voice without restraint . 
" come out , ye gift king and queen , and hear me sad complaint ! 
no martyr be among ye now who you can call you own . 
but , go on you way accordingly , but know you 're not alone . 
" i dream i see saint augustine alive with fiery breath and i dream i be amongst the one this put he out to death . 
oh , i awake in anger , so alone and terrify . 
i put me finger against the glass and bow me head and cry .
