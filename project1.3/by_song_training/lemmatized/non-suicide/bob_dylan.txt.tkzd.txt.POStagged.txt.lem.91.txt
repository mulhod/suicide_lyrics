#on a night like this on a night like this i 'm so glad you come around . 
hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee ground . 
we get much to talk about and much to reminisce . 
it sure be right on a night like this . 
on a night like this i 'm so glad you 're here to stay . 
hold on to me , pretty miss , and say you 'll never go away to stray . 
run you finger down me spine and bring me a touch of bliss . 
it sure feel right on a night like this . 
on a night like this i ca n't get any sleep. the air be so cold outside and the snow 's so deep . 
build a fire , throw on log , and listen to it hiss . 
and let it burn , burn , burn , burn on a night like this . 
put you body next to me and keep me company . 
there be plenty of room for all , so please do n't elbow me . 
let the four wind blow around this old cabin door . 
if i 'm not too far off , i think we do this once before . 
there 's more frost on the window glass with each new , tender kiss , but it sure feel right on a night like this .
