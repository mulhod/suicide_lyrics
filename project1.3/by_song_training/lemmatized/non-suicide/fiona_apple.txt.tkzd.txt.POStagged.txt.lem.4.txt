#better version of me the nickel drop when i be on me way beyond the rubicon . 
what do i do ? 
and of the game this i can handle , none be one worth the candle . 
what should i do ? 
i 'm a frighten , fickle person fight , cry , kick , curse . 
what should i do ? 
oooh , after all the folderol , and haul over coal stop , what will i do ? 
ca n't take a good day without a bad one . 
do n't feel just to smile until i 've have one . 
where do i learn ? 
i make a fuss about a little thing . 
the rhyme be lose to the riddle . 
where 's the turn ? 
i do n't want a home ; i 'd ruin this . 
home be where me habit have a habitat . 
why give it a turn ? 
oh , after all the folderol , and haul over coal stop what do i learn ? 
i be likely to miss the main eventif i stop to cry or complain again , so i will keep a deliberate pace , let the damn breeze dry me face . 
oh , mister , wait until you see what i 'm go to be . 
i 've get a plan , a demand , and it just begin , and if you 're right , you 'll agree . 
here 's come a well version of me . 
here it come a well version of me . 
here it come a well version of me .
