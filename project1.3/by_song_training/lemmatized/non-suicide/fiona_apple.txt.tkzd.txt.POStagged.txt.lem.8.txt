#oh well what you do to me make me see me something different . 
though i try to talk sense to me , but i just wo n't listen . 
wo n't you go away , turn you in . 
you 're no good at confession . 
before the image this you burn me in try to teach you a lesson . 
what you do to me make me see me something awful . 
a voice once stentorian be now again meek and muffle . 
it take me such a long time to get back up the first time you do it . 
i spend all i have to get it back , and now it seem i 've be outbidded . 
me peace and quiet be steal from me . 
when i be look with calm affection , you be search out me imperfection . 
what waste unconditional love on somebody who do n't believe in the stuff . 
you come upon me like a hypnic jerk when i be just about settle . 
and when it count you recoil with a cryptic word and leave a love belittle . 
oh what a cold and common old way to go . 
i be feed on the need for you to know me ; devastate at the rate you fall below me . 
what waste unconditional love on somebody who do n't believe in the stuff . 
oh , well .
