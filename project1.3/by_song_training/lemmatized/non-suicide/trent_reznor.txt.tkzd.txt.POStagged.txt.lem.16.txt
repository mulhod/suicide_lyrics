#ringfinger well you 've get me work so hear lately . 
work me hand until they bleed . 
if i be twice the man i can be . 
i 'd still be half of what you need . 
still you lead me and i follow . 
anything you ask you know i 'll do . 
but this one act of consecration be what i ask of you . 
ringfinger , a promise carve in stone , deep than the sea . 
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me . 
well you just leave me nail here hang like jesus on the cross . 
i 'll be dying for you sin . 
and aid to the cause . 
ringfinger , a promise carve in stone , deep than the sea . 
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me . 
wrap me eye in bandage as confession i see through . 
i get everything i want when i get part of you . 
ringfinger , a promise carve in stone , deep than the sea . 
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me . 
ringfinger , a promise carve in stone , deep than the sea . 
ringfinger , devil 's flesh and bone do something for me .
