#i be wrong oh , when i be young i be so full of fear . 
i hide behind anger , hold back the tear . 
it be me against the world . 
i be sure this i 'd win , but the world fight back , punish me for me sin . 
i feel so alone , so insecure . 
i blame you instead , make sure i be hear , and they try to warn me of me evil way but i will n't hear what they have to say . 
i be wrong . 
self destruction 's get me again . 
i be wrong . 
i realize now this i be wrong . 
and i think about me love , well , i 've have a few . 
well , i 'm sorry this i hurt they . 
do i hurt you too ? 
i take what i want , put me heart on the shelf , but how can you love me when you do n't love you ? 
it be me against the world . 
i be sure this i 'd win . 
the world fight back , punish me for me sin and they try to warn me of me evil way , but i can n't hear what they have to say . 
i be wrong . 
self destruction 's get me again . 
i be wrong . 
i realize now this i be wrong . 
i be wrong , yeah , i be wrong . 
i grow up fast , and i grow up hard . 
something be wrong from the very start . 
i be fight everybody , i be fight everything , but the only one this i hurt be me . 
i get society 's blood run down me face . 
somebody help me get outta this place . 
how can someone 's bad luck last so long ? 
until i realize this i be wrong . 
i be wrong . 
self destruction 's get me again . 
i be wrong . 
i realize now this i be wrong . 
i be wrong . 
self destruction 's get me again .

the only moment this i be me , i be wrong .
