#paper bag i be stare at the sky , just look for a star to pray on , or wish on , or something like this . 
i be have a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy who reality i know be a hopeless to be have . 
but then the dive of hope begin it downward slope , and i believe for a moment this me chance be approach to be grab . 
but as it come down near , so do a weary tear . 
i think it be a bird , but it be just a paper bag . 
hunger hurt , and i want he so bad , oh it kill because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up . 
i get to fold because this hand be too shaky to hold . 
hunger hurt , but starve work , when it cost too much to love . 
and i wend crazy again today , look for a strand to climb , look for a little hope . 
baby say he can n't stay , will n't put he lip to me , and a fail to kiss be a fail to cope . 
i say , "honey , i do n't feel so good , do n't feel justify . 
come on put a little love here in me void . 
" he say "it 's all in you head , " and i say , " so 's everything" , but he do n't get it . 
i think he be a man but he be just a little boy . 
hunger hurt , and i want he so bad , oh it kill because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up . 
i get to fold because this hand be too shaky to hold . 
hunger hurt , but starve work , when it cost too much to love . 
hunger hurt , but i want he so bad , oh it kill because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up . 
i get to fold because this hand be too shaky to hold . 
hunger hurt , but starve work , when it cost too much to love . 
hunger hurt , but i want he so bad , oh it kill because i know i 'm a mess this he do n't want to clean up . 
i get to fold because this hand be just too shaky to hold . 
hunger hurt , but starve , it work , when it cost too much to love .
