#i be a lonesome hobo i be a lonesome hobo without family or friend . 
where another man 's life may begin , this 's exactly where me end . 
i have try me hand at bribery , blackmail , and deceit and i 've serve time for everything except beg on the street . 
well , once i be rather prosperous . 
there be nothing i do lack . 
i have fourteen-karat gold in me mouth and silk upon me back , but i do not trust me brother . 
i carry he to blame , which lead me to me fatal doom , to wander off in shame . 
kind lady and kind gentleman , soon i will be go , but let me just warn you all before i do pass on . 
stay free from petty jealousy . 
live by no man 's code . 
and hold you judgment for you lest you wind up on this road .
