#tymps ( the sick in the head song ) this boon time wentbust . 
me foot of clay , they dry to dust . 
the red be n't the red we paint ; it 's just rust . 
and the signature thing this use to bring a follow , i have trouble now even remember . 
so why do i kiss he so hard late last friday night , and keep on let he change all me plan ? 
i 'm either so sick in the head i need to be bleed dry to quit , or i just really use to love he . 
i sure hope thats it . 
i know this to keep in touch will do me deep in dutch . 
cause it be n't the rush of remember , it just mush . 
and the signature thing be only grow harrow . 
i should have no trouble now to keep from follow .
