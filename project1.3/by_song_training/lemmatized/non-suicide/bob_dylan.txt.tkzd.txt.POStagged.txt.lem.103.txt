#masters of war come , you master of war , you this build the big gun , you this build the death-planes , you this build all the bomb , you this hide behind wall , you this hide behind desk . 
i just want you to know i can see through you mask . 
you this never do nothing but build to destroy , you play with me world like it 's you little toy . 
you put a gun in me hand and you hide from me eye and you turn and run far when the fast bullet fly . 
like judas of old , you lie and deceive . 
a world war can be win you want me to believe . 
but i see through you eye and i see through you brain like i see through the water this run down me drain . 
you fasten all the trigger for the others to fire . 
then you set back and watch when the death-count get high and you hide in you mansion while the young people 's blood flow out of they body and be bury in the mud . 
you 've throw the worst fear this can ever be hurl , fear to bring child into the world . 
for threaten me baby , unborn and unnamed , you be not worth the blood this run in you vein . 
how much do i know to talk out of turn ? 
you may say this i 'm young . 
you may say i 'm unlearn . 
but there 's one thing i know though i 'm young than you . 
this even jesus will never forgive what you do . 
let me ask you one question . 
be you money this good ? 
will it buy you forgiveness 
? 
do you think this it can ? 
i think you will find , when you death take it toll , all the money you make will never buy back you soul . 
and i hope this you die . 
and you death will come soon . 
i 'll follow you casket on the pale afternoon and i 'll watch while you 're lower down to you deathbed and i 'll stand over you grave till i 'm sure this you 're dead .
