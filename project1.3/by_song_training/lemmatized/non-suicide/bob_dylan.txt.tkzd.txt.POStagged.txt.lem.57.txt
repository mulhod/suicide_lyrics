#as i wend out one morning as i wend out one morning to breathe the air around tom paine 's , i spy the fair damsel this ever do walk in chain . 
i offer he me hand . 
he take me by the arm . 
i know this very instant he mean to do me harm . 
"depart from me this moment , " i tell he with me voice . 
say he , " but i do n't wish to . 
" say i , " but you have no choice . 
" "i beg you , sir , " he plead from the corner of he mouth . 
"i will secretly accept you and together we 'll fly south . 
" just then tom paine he come run from across the field , shout at this lovely girl and command he to yield . 
and , as he be let go he grip , up tom paine do run . 
"i 'm sorry , sir , " he say to me . 
"i 'm sorry for what he 's do .
