#it 's all over now , baby blue you must leave now . 
take what you need , you think will last , but whatever you wish to keep , you well grab it fast . 
yonder stand you orphan with he gun , cry like a fire in the sun . 
look out , the saint be come through and it 's all over now , baby blue . 
the highway be for gambler . 
well use you sense , take what you have gather from coincidence . 
the empty-handed painter from you street be draw crazy pattern on you sheet , the sky , too , be fold under you and it 's all over now , baby blue . 
all you seasick sailor , they 're all row home . 
you own empty-handed army be all go home . 
you lover , who just walk out you door , have take all he blanket from the floor . 
the carpet , too , be move under you and it 's all over now , baby blue . 
leave you stepping-stones behind . 
there 's something this call for you . 
forget the dead you 've leave . 
they will not follow you . 
the vagabond who 's rap at you door be stand in the clothe this you once wear . 
strike another match . 
go start anew . 
and it 's all over now , baby blue .
