# to ramona ramona , come close , shut softly you watery eye . 
the pang of you sadness will pass as you sense will rise . 
for the flower of the city , though breath-like , get death-like sometime and there 's no use in try to deal with the dying , though i can explain this in line . 
you crack country lip i still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of you skin . 
you magnetic movement still capture the minute i 'm in . 
but it grieve me heart , love , to see you try to be a part of a world this just do n't exist . 
it 's all just a dream , babe , a vacuum , a scheme , babe , this suck you into feel like this . 
i can see this you head have be twist and feed with worthless foam from the mouth . 
i can tell you be tear between stay and return back to the south . 
you 've be fool into think this the finish end be at hand . 
yet there 's no one to beat you , no one to defeat you except the thought of you feel bad . 
i 've hear you say many time this you 're well than no one and no one be well than you . 
if you really believe this , you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose . 
from fixture and force and friend you sorrow do stem this hype you and type you and make you feel this you get to be just like they . 
i 'd forever talk to you , but soon me word , they will turn into a meaningless ring for deep in me heart i know there 's no help i can bring . 
everything pass , everything change . 
just do what you think you should do and someday maybe , who know , baby , i 'll come and be cry to you .
