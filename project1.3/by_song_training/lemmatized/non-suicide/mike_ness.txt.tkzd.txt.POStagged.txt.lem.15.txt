i know a girl who warn of the danger of love , all the pain and the anguish , the sorrow this it bring . 
he keep he in a world this 's protect . 
he outside be tough , but inside he heart long to sing . 
do n't let you wall down , you may fall in love , you may fall in love . 
he 's go to get he girlfriend 's name tattoo on he neck and hope he never , never live to regret . 
he 's go to walk down this long , dark alley and what he find there you know he 'll never forget . 
do n't let you wall down , you may fall in love , you may fall in love . 
they 're crash down now . 
you may fall in love . 
i remember a time i believe this the word love and pain be both one in the same . 
i 'm go to trade in me old way for a new shoot at life . 
i 'm go to change , change me direction . 
i 'm go to change me way . 
do n't let you wall down , you may fall in love , you may fall in love . 
they 're crash down now . 
it 's you i 'm think of , it 's you i 'm think of . 
let 's fall in love .
