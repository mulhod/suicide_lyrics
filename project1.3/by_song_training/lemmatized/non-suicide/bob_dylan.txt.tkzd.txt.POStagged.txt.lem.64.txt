#i pity the poor immigrant i pity the poor immigrant who wish he will 've stay home , who use all he power to do evil , but in the end be always leave so alone , this man who with he finger cheat and who lie with every breath , who passionately hate he life and likewise fear he death . 
i pity the poor immigrant who strength be spend in vain , who heaven be like ironside 's , who tear be like rain , who eat , but be not satisfy , who hear , but do not see , who fall in love with wealth it and turn he back on me . 
i pity the poor immigrant who trample through the mud , who fill he mouth with laugh and who build he town with blood , who vision in the final end must shatter like the glass . 
i pity the poor immigrant when he gladness come to pass .
