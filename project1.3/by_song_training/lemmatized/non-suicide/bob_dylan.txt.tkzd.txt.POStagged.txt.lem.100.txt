#wedding song i love you more than ever , more than time and more than love . 
i love you more than money and more than the star above . 
love you more than madness , more than dream upon the sea . 
i love you more than life it . 
you mean this much to me . 
ever since you walk right in , the circle 's be complete . 
i say goodbye to haunt room and face in the street , to the courtyard of the jester , which be hide from the sun . 
i love you more than ever and i have n't yet begin . 
you breathe on me and make me life a rich one to live . 
when i be deep in poverty , you teach me how to give , dry the tear up from me dream , and pull me from the hole . 
i love you more than ever and it burn me to the soul . 
you give me baby , one , two , three . 
what be more ? 
you save me life . 
eye for eye and tooth for tooth , you love cut like a knife . 
me thought of you do n't ever rest . 
they 'd kill me if i lie . 
but i 'd sacrifice the world for you to watch me sense die . 
the tune this be you and me to play upon this earth , we 'll play it out the well we know , whatever it be worth . 
what 's lose be lose . 
we ca n't regain what wend down in the flood , but happiness to me be you and i love you more than blood . 
it 's never be me duty to remake the world at large nor be it me intention to sound a battle charge because i love you more than all of this with a love this do n't bend and , if there be eternity , i 'll love you there again . 
oh , ca n't you see this you be bear to stand by me side and i be bear to be with you , you be bear to be me bride ? 
you 're the other half of what i be . 
you 're the miss piece and i love you more than ever with this love this do n't cease . 
you turn the tide on me each day and teach me eye to see . 
just be next to you be a natural thing for me and i can never let you go , no matter what go on because i love you more than ever now this the past be go .
