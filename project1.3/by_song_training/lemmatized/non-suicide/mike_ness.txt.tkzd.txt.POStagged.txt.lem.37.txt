#through this eye through this eye i 've see love and i 've see hate . 
i 've see the violence and the tear through this eye . 
i get me school on the street . 
i 've see the thing in life you do n't want to see . 
through this eye , i 've see the shape of thing to come , and i 've watch they all fall apart , through this eye . 
i 've see the break home , they cry . 
i 've see the poor man 's face as he stand in line . 
and though me heart have make me weary on a road less travel on . 
through the heart it hurt so dearly and the pain it linger on . 
through this eye , i 've look the devil in the face and i 've see god 's holy grace , through this eye . 
i 've try to walk the straighter line . 
i find me again but nearly lose me mind . 
and though me heart have make me weary on a road less travel on . 
through the heart it hurt so dearly and the pain it linger on , yeah . 
and though me heart have make me weary on a road less travel on . 
through the heart it hurt so dearly and the pain it linger on . 
and though me heart have make me weary on a road less travel on . 
through the heart it hurt so dearly and the pain it linger on .
