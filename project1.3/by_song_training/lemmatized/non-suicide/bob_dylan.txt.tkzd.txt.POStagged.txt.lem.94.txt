#hazel hazel , dirty-blonde hair , i will n't be ashamed to be see with you anywhere . 
you get something i want plenty of , ooh , a little touch of you love . 
hazel , stardust in you eye , you 're go somewhere and so be i . 
i 'd give you the sky high above , ooh , for the touch of you love . 
oh , no , i do n't need any reminder to know how much i really care . 
but it 's just make me blind and blind because i 'm up on a hill and still you 're not there . 
hazel , you call and i come . 
now , do n't make me play this wait game . 
you get something i want plenty of , ooh , a little touch of you love .
