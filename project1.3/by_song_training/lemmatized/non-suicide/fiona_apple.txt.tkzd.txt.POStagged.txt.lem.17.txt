#slow like honey you move like honey in me dream last night . 
yeah , some old fire be burn . 
you come near to me and you endear to me , but you can n't quit discern me . 
do this scare you ? 
i 'll let you run away , but you heart will not oblige you . 
you 'll remember me like a melody . 
yeah , i 'll haunt the world inside you . 
and me big secret : go to win you over , slow like honey , heavy with mood . 
i 'll let you see me . 
i 'll covet you regard . 
i 'll invade you demeanor , and you 'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze . 
and you 'll wonder what it be about me . 
it 's me big secre : keep you come , slow like honey , heavy with mood . 
though dream can be deceive , like face be to heart , they serve for sweet relieve when fantasy and reality lie too far apart . 
so i stretch me across like a bridge , and i pull you to the edge and stand there wait , try to attain the end to satisfy the story . 
shall i release you ? 
must i release you as i rise to meet me glory ? 
but me big secret , go to hover over you life , go to keep you reach , when i 'm go like yesterday , when i 'm high like heaven , when i 'm strong like music , because i 'm slow like honey , and heavy with mood .
