" # when the ship come in oh , the time will come up when the wind will stop and the breeze will cease to be breathe , like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begin , the hour this the ship come in . 
and the sea will split and the ship will hit and the sand on the shoreline will be shake . 
and the tide will sound and the wave will pound and the morning will be break . 
the fish will laugh as they swim out of the path and the seagull , they 'll be smile . 
and the rock on the sand will proudly stand , the hour this the ship come in . 
and the word this be use for to get the ship confuse will not be understand as they 're speak for the chain of the sea will have bust in the night and be bury on the bottom of the ocean . 
a song will lift as the mainsail shift and the boat drift onto the shoreline . 
and the sun will respect every face on the deck , the hour this the ship come in . 
and the sand will roll out a carpet of gold for you weary toe to be touch . 
and the ship 's wise man will remind you once again this the whole , wide world be watch . 
oh , the foe will rise with the sleep still in they eye and they 'll jerk from they bed and think they 're dream , but they 'll pinch they and squeal and they 'll know this it 's for real , the hour when the ship come in . 
and they 'll raise they hand , say , "we 'll meet all you demand . 
" but we 'll shout from the bow , "your day be number . 
" and like pharaoh 's tribe they 'll be drownded in the tide and like goliath they 'll be conquer .
