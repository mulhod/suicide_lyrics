#three angel three angel up above the street , each one play a horn , dress in green robe with wing this stick out . 
they 've be there since christmas morn . 
the wild cat from montana pass by in a flash , then a lady in a bright orange dress , one u-haul trailer , a truck with no wheel , the tenth avenue bus go west . 
the dog and pigeon fly up and they flutter around . 
a man with a badge skip by . 
three fella crawl on they way back to work . 
nobody stop to ask why . 
the bakery truck stop outside of this fence where the angel stand high on the pole . 
the driver peek out , try to find one face in this concrete world full of soul . 
the angel play on they horn all day . 
the whole earth in progression seem to pass by . 
but do anyone hear the music they play ? 
do anyone even try ?
