#north country blue come gather around , friend , and i 'll tell you a tale of when the red iron ore pit run plenty . 
but the cardboard-filled window and old man on the bench tell you now this the whole town be empty . 
in the north end of town , me own children're grow , but i be raise on the other . 
in the wee hour of youth , me mother take sick and i be bring up by me brother . 
the iron ore pour as the year pass the door . 
the drag line and the shovel , they be hum till one day me brother fail to come home , the same as me father before he . 
well , the long winter 's wait from the window i watch . 
me friend , they can n't 've be kind . 
and me school be cut as i quit in the spring to marry john thomas , a miner . 
oh , the year pass again and the give be good with the lunch bucket fill every season . 
what with three baby bear , the work be cut down to a half a day 's shift with no reason . 
then the shaft be soon shut and more work be cut and the fire in the air , it feel freeze till a man come to speak and he say in one week this number eleven be close . 
they complain in the east they be pay too high . 
they say this you ore be not worth dig , this it 's much cheap down in the south american town , where the miner work almost for nothing . 
so , the mine gate lock and the red iron rot and the room smell heavy from drink when the sad , silent song make the hour twice as long as i wait for the sun to go sink . 
i live by the window as he talk to he . 
this silence of tongue , it be build till one morning 's wake the be , it be bare and i 's leave alone with three child . 
the summer be go . 
the grind 's turn cold . 
the store one by one , they 're fold . 
me child will go as soon as they grow . 
well , there be not nothing here now to hold they .
