#sanctified it 's still get worse after everything i try . 
what if i find a way to wash it all aside ? 
what if he touch with this fingertip as the word spill out like fire from he lip . 
if he say come inside i 'll come inside for he . 
if he say give it all , i 'll give everything to he . 
i be justify . 
i be purify . 
i be sanctify . 
inside you . 
heaven 's just a rumor he 'll dispel as he walk me through the nice part of hell . 
i still dream of lip i never should have never kiss . 
well he know exactly what i ca n't resist if he say come inside i 'll come inside for he . 
if he say give it all , i 'll give everything to he . 
i be justify . 
i be purify . 
i be sanctify . 
inside you . 
i 'm just catch up in another of he spell . 
while he 's turn me into someone else . 
everyday i hope and pray this will end , but when i can i do it all again . 
if he say come inside i 'll come inside for he . 
if he say give it all , i 'll give everything to he . 
i be justify . 
i be purify . 
i be sanctify . 
inside you . 
i be justify . 
i be purify . 
i be sanctify . 
inside you .
