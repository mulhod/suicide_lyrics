#limp you want to make me sick . 
you want to lick me wound , do n't you , baby ? 
you want the badge of honor when you save me hide , but you 're the one in the way of the day of doom , baby , if you need me shame to reclaim you pride . 
and when i think of it , me finger turn to fist . 
i never do anything to you , man . 
but no matter what i try , you 'll beat me with you bitter lie , so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; get off now , baby . 
it wont be long till you 'll be lie limp in you own hand . 
you fee the beast i have within me . 
you wave the red flag , baby , you make it run , run , run . 
stand on the sideline , wave and grin , you fondle me trigger , then you blame me gun . 
and when i think of it , me finger turn to fist . 
i never do anything to you , man . 
but no matter what i try you 'll beat me with you bitter lie so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; get off now , baby . 
it wont be long till you 'll be lie limp in you own hand . 
and when i think of it , me finger turn to fist . 
i never do anything to you , man . 
but no matter what i try you 'll beat me with you bitter lie so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; get off now , baby . 
it wont be long till you 'll be lie limp in you own hand .
