#fourth time around when he say , "do n't waste you word , they 're just lie , " i cry he be deaf as he work on me face till break me eye , then say , "what else you get leave ? 
" it be then this i get up to leave , but he say , "do n't forget . 
everybody must give something back for something they get . 
" i stand there and hum . 
i tap on he drum . 
i ask he , "how come ? 
" and he button he boot and straighten he suit . 
then he say , "do n't get cute . 
" so i force me hand in me pocket and feel with me thumb and gallantly hand he me very last piece of gum . 
he throw me outside . 
i stand in the dirt where everyone walk . 
and , after find this i 'd forget me shirt , i wend back and knock . 
i wait in the hallway . 
he wend to get it and i try to make sense out of this picture of you in you wheelchair this lean up against he jamaican rum and , when he do come , i ask he for some . 
he say , "no , dear . 
" i say , "your word be n't clearly . 
you well spit out you plum . 
" he scream till he face get so red . 
then he fall on the floor and i cover he up and then think i 'll go look through he drawer . 
and when i be through , i fill up me shoe and bring it to you . 
and you , you take me in . 
you love me then . 
you never waste time , and i , i never take much . 
i never ask for you crutch . 
now , do n't ask for me .
