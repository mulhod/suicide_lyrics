#on the bind all me life be on me now .

and the future be on the bind . 
hell do n't know me fury . 
you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need youre all i need - and maybe some faith will do me good . 
i do n't know what i 'm do . 
do n't know , should i change me mind ? 
i ca n't decide . 
there 's too many variation to consider . 
no thing i do do n't do no thing but bring me more to do . 
it 's true , i do imbue me blue unto me . 
i make it bitter . 
baby , lie you head on me lap one more time . 
tell me you belong to me . 
baby say this it 's all go to be alright . 
i believe this it be n't . 
you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need youre all i need - and maybe some faith will do me good , and maybe some faith will do me good , and maybe some faith will do me good .
