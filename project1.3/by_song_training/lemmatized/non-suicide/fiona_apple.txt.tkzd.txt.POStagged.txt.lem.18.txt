# the first taste i lie in an early be think late thought wait for the black to replace me blue . 
i do not struggle in you web because it be me aim to get catch . 
but daddy longlegs , i feel this i 'm finally grow weary of wait to be consume by you . 
give me the first taste . 
let it begin . 
heaven can wait forever . 
darling , just start the chase . 
i 'll let you win , but you must make the endeavour . 
oh , you love give me a heart confusion . 
adagio breeze fill me skin with sudden red . 
you hungry flirt border intrusion . 
i 'm build memory on thing we have not say . 
full be not heavy as empty , not nearly me love , not nearly me love , not nearly . 
give me the first taste . 
let it begin . 
heaven can wait forever . 
darling , just start the chase . 
i 'll let you win , but you must make the endeavour .
