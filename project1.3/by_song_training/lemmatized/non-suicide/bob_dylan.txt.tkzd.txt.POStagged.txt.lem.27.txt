#simple twist of fate they sit together in the park as the even sky grow dark . 
he look at he and he feel a spark tingle to he bone . 
'twas then he feel alone and wish this he 'd go straight and watch out for a simple twist of fate . 
they walk along by the old canal , a little confuse - i remember well - and stop into a strange hotel with a neon burn bright . 
he feel the heat of the night hit he like a freight train , move with a simple twist of fate . 
a saxophone someplace far off play as he be walk on by the arcade , as the light burst through a beat-up shade , where he be wake up . 
he drop a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate and forget about a simple twist of fate . 
he wake up . 
the room be bare . 
he do n't see he anywhere . 
he tell he he do n't care , push the window open wide , feel this emptiness inside to which he just can not relate , bring on by a simple twist of fate . 
he hear the tick of the clock and walk along with a parrot this talk , hunt he down by the waterfront dock where the sailor all come in . 
maybe he 'll pick he out again . 
how long must he wait one more time for a simple twist of fate ? 
people tell me it 's a sin to know and feel too much within . 
i still believe he be me twin , but i lose the ring . 
he be bear in spring , but i be bear too late . 
blame it on a simple twist of fate .
