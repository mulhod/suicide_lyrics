#i do n't believe you i ca n't understand . 
he let go of me hand and leave me here face the wall . 
i 'd sure like to know why he do go , but i ca n't get close to he at all . 
though we kiss through the wild , blaze night-time , he say he will never forget . 
but now morning be clearly . 
it 's like i be not here . 
he act like we never meet . 
it 's all new to me , like some mystery . 
it can even be like a myth . 
but it 's hard to think on this he 's the same one this last night i be with . 
from darkness , dream be desert . 
be i still dream yet ? 
i wish he 'd unlock he voice once and talk instead of act like we never meet . 
if he be not feel well , then why do n't he tell instead of turn he back to me face ? 
without any doubt he seem too far out for me to return to or chase . 
and he skirt , it sway as the guitar play . 
he mouth be watery and wet . 
but now something have change for he be not the same . 
he just act like we never have meet . 
if i do n't have to guess , i 'd gladly confess to anything i may 've try . 
if i be with he too long or have do something wrong , i 'd wish he 'd tell me what it be . 
i 'll run and hide . 
though the night run swirl and whirl , i remember he whisper yet . 
but evidently he do n't . 
evidently he wo n't . 
he just act like we never have meet . 
i 'm leave today . 
i 'll be on me way . 
of this i ca n't say very much . 
but if you want me to , i can be just like you and pretend this we never have touch . 
and , if anybody ask me , "is it easy to forget ? 
" i 'll say , "it 's easily do . 
you just pick anyone and pretend this you never have meet .
