#gimmie the sweet and lowdown it be a moonlight mishap , you lose you party hat . 
seem you lifestyle be not so worthwhile after all . 
a heavy-hearted taxi ride then a walk on the wild side . 
do you guardian angel let you down ? 
go to lie low and play it straight . 
it 's time to rejuvenate . 
go to kick start you heart until you come around . 
i can tell you now : you 've really gotten the blue . 
i can tell you now this i 've walk in you shoe . 
gimme the sweet and lowdown . 
you well get outta the way . 
it 's history make the hard way . 
from a hero to a zero once again . 
aing . 
no time for vanity or this insanity . 
you 're maladjusted , and now you 're bust once again . 
i can tell you now it come as no surprise . 
i can tell you now by this look in you eye . 
gimme the sweet and lowdown . 
you 're look kinda punch drink because this 's the way you strut you stuff , with a swing and a swagger down the road you go . 
you should 've make a well choice and listen to you inner voice . 
you get to get right or get leave , do n't ya know . 
i can tell you now : it 's the peak of bad news . 
i can tell you now this i 've walk in you shoe . 
gimme the sweet and lowdown , the sweet and lowdown , gimme the sweet - the sweet and lowdown .
