#something must break someone take this dream away this point me to another day , a duel of personality this stretch all true reality , this keep call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me . 
where figure from the past stand tall and mock voice ring the hall , imperialistic house of prayer , conquistador who take they share this keep call me , they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me . 
they keep call me . 
call me , call me , call me , call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me . 
they keep call me .
