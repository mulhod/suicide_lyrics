# no love lose so long sit he . 
do n't hear the warn . 
wait for the tape to run . 
we 've be move around in different situation , know this the time will come , just to see you tear apart , witness to you empty heart . 
i need it . 
i need it . 
i need it . 
through the wire screen , the eye of this stand outside look in at he as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo . 
in the hand of one of the assistant he see the same instrument which they have this morning insert deep into he body . 
he shudder instinctively . 
no life at all in the house of doll . 
no love lose . 
no love lose . 
you 've be see thing in darkness , not in learn , hope this the truth will pass . 
no life underground . 
waste . 
never change . 
wish this this day wo n't last . 
to never see you show you age , to watch until the beauty fade , i need it . 
i need it . 
i need it .
