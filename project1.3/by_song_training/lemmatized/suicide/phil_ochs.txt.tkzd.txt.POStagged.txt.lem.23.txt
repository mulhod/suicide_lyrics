#automation song oh , i lay down you railroad , every mile of track , with the muscle on me arm and the sweat upon me back . 
and now the train be roll . 
they roll to every shear . 
you tell me this me job be through . 
there be not no work no more . 
though i lay down you highway all across the land with the ring of the steel and the power of me hand and now the road be there like ribbon in the sky , you tell me this me job be through , but still i wonder why for the wage be low and the hour be long and the labor be all i can bear . 
now you 've get new machine for to take me place and you tell me it 's not me to share . 
though i lay down you factory and lay down you field with me foot on the grind and me back to you wheel and now the smoke be rise , the steel be all a-glow , i 'm walk down a jobless road and where be i to go ? 
for the wage be low and the hour be long and the labor be all i can bear . 
now you 've get new machine for to take me place and you tell me it 's not me to share . 
though i lay down you factory and lay down you field with me foot on the grind and me back to you wheel and now the smoke be rise , the steel be all a-glow , i 'm walk down a jobless road and where be i to go ? 
tell me , where be i to go ?
