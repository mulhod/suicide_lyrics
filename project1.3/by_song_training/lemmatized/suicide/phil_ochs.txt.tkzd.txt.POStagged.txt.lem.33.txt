#my kingdom for a car i 've find me freedom . 
he and i be fly down this highway of gold . 
me shirtsleeve be roll . 
me colt 45th be cold . 
i go fast till i 'm go fast . 
look how far we 've come , look how far . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car . 
how i love the highway . 
pick me up and take me wherever i please . 
i race through the tree , bring space to he knee . 
i be master of all this 's fly past me . 
look how far we 've come , look how far . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car . 
look how far we 've come , look how far . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car . 
take me to tomorrow . 
let me go on race with the wind in me hair . 
there 's smoke in the air , but i do not care . 
if you want me , you will have to pass me . 
look how far we 've come , look how far . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car . 
come to me , baby . 
we will leave this town . 
it be not make for a man . 
we 'll find a new land , but the traffic be jam . 
i wend far , but it 's a time for walk . 
look how far we 've come , look how far . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car . 
a car , a car , me kingdom for a car .
