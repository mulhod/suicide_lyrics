#new dawn fade a change of speed , a change of style , a change of scene with no regret , a chance to watch , admire the distance still occupy though you forget . 
different color , different shade , over each mistake be make . 
i take the blame . 
directionless , so plain to see , a load gun wo n't set you free , so you say . 
we 'll share a drink and step outside , an angry voice and one who cry , "we 'll give you everything and more . 
the straing . 
too much , ca n't take much more . 
" oh , i 've walk on water , run through fire , ca n't seem to feel it anymore . 
it be me , wait for me , hope for something more , me see me this time , hope for something else .
