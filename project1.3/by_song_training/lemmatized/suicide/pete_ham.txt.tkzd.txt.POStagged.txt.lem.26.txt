# i 'll be the one where do you go when you be need ? 
be it some place i know , where they care ? 
cry in the rain . 
i 'll learn to get by without you for the pain in me heart . 
i 'll be the one . 
we 'll be together . 
i 'll be the one forever and ever . 
look at me now . 
be i the loser ? 
if you ca n't tell me how , tell me why . 
but just the same , i 'll learn to get by without you for the pain in me heart . 
i 'll be the one . 
we 'll be together . 
i 'll be the one forever and ever and ever . 
i 'll be the one . 
we 'll be together . 
i 'll be the one forever and ever and ever .
