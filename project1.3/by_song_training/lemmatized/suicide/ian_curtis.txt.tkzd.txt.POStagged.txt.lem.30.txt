# the kill move in a hire car and i find no way to run . 
add every moment long . 
have no time for fun . 
just something this i know i have to do . 
but through it all i leave me eye on you . 
i have an impulse to clearly it all away . 
oh , i use the tactic . 
make everybody pay . 
just something this i know i have to do . 
but through it all i keep me eye on you . 
oh , i keep it all clean . 
i 've pay the grace there . 
no king of misuse . 
no seller of flesh . 
just something this i know i have to do . 
but through it all i keep me eye on you . 
yeah , through it all i keep me eye on you . 
but through it all i keep me eye on you .
