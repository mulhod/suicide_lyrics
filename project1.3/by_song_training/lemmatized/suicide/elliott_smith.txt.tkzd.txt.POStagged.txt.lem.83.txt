#drive all over town two-dollar color picture from a photo booth , dirty , step on , lie out on the floor of they room . 
face fall long in the half-light . 
he look all wrong , but this 's he alright . 
look at he smile full of teeth clench tight . 
he know the one time with the army captain he get one this whole deal before it happen , say it 's okay , i know exactly what you mean when you say you be an accident . 
but , when it 's 3rd be , he wonder where in the hell he wend and he 'll drive all over town , drive all over town , and he 'll drive all over town , drive all over town . 
until he track he down , he 'll drive all over town .
