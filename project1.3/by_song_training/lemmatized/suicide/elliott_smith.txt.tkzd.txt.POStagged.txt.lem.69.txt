#placeholder look at all the row , all this record look like big zero . 
get you picture on the back of a forty-five , a placeholder till you take up me , a placeholder till you take up me . 
i 'm the person you 'll never need , the big loser on sixteenth street , the invisible man with the see-through mind , a placeholder till you take up me , a placeholder till you take up me . 
break off in someone 's laughter every time i 'm there next to the square . 
he like the way this you look now like an open book . 
just like me favorite song , some pretty word this do n't last this long , like a package send priority overnight . 
placeholder , come and take up me . 
placeholder , come and take up me . 
placeholder , come and take up me . 
placeholder , come and take up me .
