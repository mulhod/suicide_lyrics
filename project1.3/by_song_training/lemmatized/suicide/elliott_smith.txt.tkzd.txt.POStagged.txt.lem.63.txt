#go by go on and parade and fade , hit the scene and slow , spend all you time with some girl you 'll never get to know , wind uptight , dress all in white , blow out to drift . 
need you even here . 
you live up in you head , scare of every little noise , someone always break in accidentally use nothing but they voice , shrill and small echo down the hall , repeat pet name , sit in you eye . 
you 're only pass by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
someone 's in the way . 
pretty word and inside slur , all the thing they have to say to perform the work this they 've rehearse . 
it 's a waste of time . 
i put it behind me once and for all and let the time decline if the problem be n't me . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by . 
go by .
