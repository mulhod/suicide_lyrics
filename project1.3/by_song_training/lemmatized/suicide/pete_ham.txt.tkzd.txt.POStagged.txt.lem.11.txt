#carry on till tomorrow in young day , i tell me me life will be me own and i 'd leave the place where sunshine never shine for me life 's too short for wait . 
when i see the rise sun , then i know again this i must carry on , carry on till tomorow . 
there 's no reason to look back . 
carry on , carry on , carry on beyond the shadow of the cloud and onward to the sky . 
carry on till i find the rainbow 's end for me life 's too short for wait . 
when i see the rise sun , then i know again this i must carry on , carry on till tomorow . 
there 's no reason to look back . 
carry on , carry on , carry on . 
drift on the wing of freedom , leave this stormy day and we 'll ride to tomorrow 's golden field for me life 's too short for wait . 
when i see the rise sun , then i know again this i must carry on , carry on , carry on , carry on . 
and , when the heavy journey 's do , i 'll rest me weary head for the world and it colour will be me for me life 's too short for wait . 
when i see the set sun , then i know again this i must carry on , carry on till tomorow . 
there 's no reason to look back . 
carry on , carry on , carry on .
