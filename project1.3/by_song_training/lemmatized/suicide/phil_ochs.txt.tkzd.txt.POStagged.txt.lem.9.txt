#ballad of oxford ( jimmy meredith ) i 'll sing you a song about a southern town where the devil have he rule , when marshal face an angry mob to send one man to school . 
he name be jimmy meredith , the tide he help to turn for he choose to stay on this terrible day the land be soon to learn . 
there be blood , red blood , on they hand , yellow dirt on they clothe . 
what they think they be do only god and the devil know . 
there be hate , cold hate , in they heart , shoot from they soul like a gun , and , as they throw they stone and brick , they scream , " see what you have do ! 
" the governor make a promise he will keep the trouble down , but , when the mob get ugly , no trooper can be find and man be fill with hate and fear . 
they scream into the night . 
the rebel flag wave in the air , the symbol of state ' right . 
there be blood , red blood , on they hand , yellow dirt on they clothe . 
what they think they be do only god and the devil know . 
there be hate , cold hate , in they heart , shoot from they soul like a gun , and , as they throw they stone and brick , they scream , " see what you have do ! 
" gas be fire into the mob after each attack and , though the gas be run low , they never fire back . 
and , when the smoke have clear and the fury feel it pain , two man be dead and a hundred bleed . 
the south have rise again . 
so listen mr barnet and mr walker , too . 
the time be change mighty fast . 
they 'll roll right over you . 
but someday you 'll head for the south , to the southern tip of hell and it 's hot down there , white-hot down there . 
let 's hear you rebel yell ! 
there be blood , red blood , on they hand , yellow dirt on they clothe . 
what they think they be do only god and the devil know . 
there be hate , cold hate , in they heart , shoot from they soul like a gun , and , as they throw they stone and brick , they scream , " see what you have do ! 
" " see what you have do !
