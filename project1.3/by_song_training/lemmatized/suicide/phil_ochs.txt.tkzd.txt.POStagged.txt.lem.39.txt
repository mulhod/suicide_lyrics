#basket in the pool wend to a party the other night . 
everybody be there . 
think this i will have some fun as i start up the stair . 
somebody try to ruin it when he win a raffle prize . 
try to shake and shock we right before we eye . 
while we dance , while we be dance , who be the fool throw the basket in the pool ? 
it be fill with the fine cheese , fill with import wine . 
wish this i have win it and i wish this it be me . 
i know some wino life outside of town who will gladly cut you throat if he can drink it down . 
while we dance , while we be dance , who be the fool throw the basket in the pool ? 
if i have find out who he be , if i 'd have find he face , next time we have a party go to find out he name . 
i 've be on the ocean swim . 
know porpoise lead the way . 
it be n't worth the matter and it be n't worth the pay . 
we be there , go right on dance . 
who be the fool throw the basket in the pool ? 
how can i go swim now ? 
me world be lay to waste . 
it be the worst of manner and it be the worst of taste . 
why ca n't we be leave alone ? 
think this it be a crime . 
if everyone be groovy , we can all have a real good time . 
we can dance , go right on dance . 
who be the fool throw the basket in the pool ?
