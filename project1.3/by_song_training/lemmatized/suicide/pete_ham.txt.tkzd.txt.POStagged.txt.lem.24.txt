# we 're for the dark tell me the day and i 'll set you free , what you want to be . 
show me the way and i 'll let you see what you do to me . 
well , it 's not enough to live . 
if you 're go to take , then you have to give . 
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i . 
show me the cloud and i 'll give you sky if you want me to . 
show me the crowd and i 'll make you sigh if you take me through . 
well , it 's not enough to be . 
if you 're go to look , then you have to see . 
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i . 
show me the way and i 'll set you free , what you ought to be . 
tell me the day and i 'll let you see what you do to me . 
well , it 's not enough to live . 
if you 're go to take , then you have to give . 
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i . 
show me the cloud and i 'll give you sky if you want me to . 
show me the crowd and i 'll make you cry if you take me through . 
well , it 's not enough to be . 
if you gotta look , then you have to see . 
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i .
