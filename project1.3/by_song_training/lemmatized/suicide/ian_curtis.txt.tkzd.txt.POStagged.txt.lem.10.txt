#transmission radio , live transmission . 
radio , live transmission . 
listen to the silence . 
let it ring on . 
eye , dark grey lense frighten of the sun . 
we will have a fine time live in the night , leave to blind destruction , wait for we sight . 
and we will go on as though nothing be wrong and hide from this day . 
we remain all alone , stay in the same place , just stay out the time , touch from a distance , further all the time . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
well , i can call out when the go get tough . 
the thing this we 've learn be no long enough . 
no language , just sound , this 's all we need know to synchronise love to the beat of the show . 
and we can dance . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio . 
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
