#give it a try give it a try and we can make it so high . 
you 'll never feel this way again . 
wipe off you sorrow and pain . 
come into me heart . 
just give it the time . 
should work out fine . 
we can make it . 
we can break it . 
it 's not a command . 
just give me you hand . 
we can break it . 
whoa , oh , we can take it , take it . 
give it a try and then change you desire . 
you 'll never make love on you own now this the love seed be sow . 
do n't put out the fire . 
give it the time . 
we can work out fine . 
we can make it . 
we can break it . 
it 's not a command . 
baby , give me you hand . 
we can break it . 
we can take it . 
give it a try and we can make it so high . 
you 'll never feel this way again . 
wipe off you sorrow and pain . 
come into me heart . 
give it a try and then change you desire . 
you 'll never make love on you own now this the love seed be sow . 
do n't put out the fire , yea !
