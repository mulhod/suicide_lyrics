# the man behind the gun let 's drink a toast to the admiral and here 's to the captain bold and glory more for the commodore when the deed of may be tell . 
they stand to the deck with the battle 's wreck when the great shell roar and pound and never they fear when the foe be near to lie they order down . 
but off with you hat and three time three for every sailor 's son , for the man below who fight the foe , the man behind the gun , oh , the man behind the gun . 
they heart pound heavy when they swing to port once more , with never enough of the greenback stuff they start for the leave ashore . 
and you 'd think perhaps the blue-blouse chap have well clothe to wear for the uniform of officer can hardly be compare . 
warrior bold with strap of gold this dazzle like the sun outshine the common sailor boy , the lad who serve the gun , oh , the man behind the gun . 
but say not a word till the shoot be hear this tell the fight be on and the angry sound of another round say there must be go over the deep and the deadly sweep , oh , the fire and the burst shell , where the very air be a mad despair , the throe of a live hell . 
but down and deep in a mighty ship , unseen by the midday sun , oh , you 'll find the boy who make the noise , the lad who serve the gun , oh , the man behind the gun . 
and , well , they know the cyclone blow loose from the cannon 's steel and they know the hull of the enemy ship will quiver with the peal and the deck will rock with the lightning shock and shake with the great recoil while the sea grow red with the blood of the dead and swallow up he spoil . 
but not until the final ship have make he final run can we give they rest to the very well , the lad who serve the gun , oh , the man behind the gun . 
so let 's drink a toast to the admiral and here 's to the captain bold and glory more for the commodore when the deed of may be tell . 
they stand to the deck with the battle 's wreck when the great shell roar and pound and never they fear when the foe be near to lie they order down . 
but off with you hat and three time three for every sailor 's son , for the man below who fight the foe , the man behind the gun , oh , the man behind the gun .
