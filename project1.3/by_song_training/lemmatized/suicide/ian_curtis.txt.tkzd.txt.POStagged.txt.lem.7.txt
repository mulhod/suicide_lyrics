#twenty four hour so this be permanence , love 's shatter pride , what once be innocence turn on it side . 
a cloud hang over me , mark every move , deep in the memory of what once be love . 
oh , how i realize ! 
how i want time ! 
put into perspective . 
try so hard to find . 
just for one moment , think i 'd find me way . 
destiny unfold . 
i watch it slip away . 
excessive flashpoint , beyond all reach . 
solitary demand for all i 'd like to keep. let 's take a ride out . 
see what we can find . 
a valueless collection of hope and past desire . 
i never realize the length i 'd have to go , all the dark corner of a sense i do n't know . 
just for one moment , i hear somebody call . 
look beyond the day in hand . 
there 's nothing there at all . 
now this i 've realize how it 's all go wrong , get to find some therapy . 
this treatment take too long . 
deep in the heart of where sympathy hold sway , get to find me destiny before it get too late .
