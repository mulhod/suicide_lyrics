# the sound of music see me true reflection . 
cut off me own connection . 
i can see life get hard . 
so sad be this sensation . 
reverse the situation . 
i ca n't see it get well . 
i 'll walk you through the heartbreak , show you all the outtake . 
i ca n't see it get high , systematically degrade , emotionally a scapegoat . 
i ca n't see it get well . 
perverse and unrealistic . 
try to make it all sick . 
i ca n't see it get well . 
hollow now , i 'm burn out . 
all i need to break out . 
i ca n't see life get high . 
love of life make you feel high . 
love of life make you feel high , high , high , high , high , , high , high , high , high . 
love of life make you feel high .
