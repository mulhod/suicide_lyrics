#southern belle kill a southern belle be all you know how to do , this and give other people hell . 
it 's what they expect from you too , but i will n't have you how you want . 
i do n't want to walk around . 
i do n't even want to breathe . 
i live in a southern town where all you can do be grit you teeth , but i will n't have you how you want . 
how come you 're not ashamed of what you be ? 
and sorry this you 're the one he get ? 
be not nobody talk now , nobody . 
nothing 's say . 
no one 's about to shout . 
nobody 's see red , but i will n't have you how you want . 
you 're kill a southern belle , kill a southern belle , kill a southern belle .
