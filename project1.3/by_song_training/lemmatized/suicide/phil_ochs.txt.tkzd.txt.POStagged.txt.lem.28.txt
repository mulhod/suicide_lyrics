#too many martyr in the state of mississippi many year ago , a boy of 14th year get a taste of southern law . 
he see he friend hang and he color be he crime and the blood upon he jacket leave a brand upon he mind . 
too many martyr and too many dead , too many lie , too many empty word be say . 
too many time for too many angry man . 
oh , let it never be again . 
he name be medgar evers and he walk he road alone like emmett till and thousand more who name we 'll never know . 
they try to burn he home and they beat he to the grind , but deep inside they both know what it take to bring he down . 
too many martyr and too many dead , too many lie , too many empty word be say . 
too many time for too many angry man . 
oh , let it never be again . 
the killer wait by he home hide by the night as evers step out from he car into the rifle sight . 
he slowly squeeze the trigger . 
the bullet leave he side . 
it strike the heart of every man when evers fall and die . 
too many martyr and too many dead , too many lie , too many empty word be say . 
too many time for too many angry man . 
oh , let it never be again . 
and they lay he in he grave while the bugle sound clearly , lay he in he grave when the victory be near , while we wait for the future for freedom through the land . 
the country gain a killer and the country lose a man . 
too many martyr and too many dead , too many lie , too many empty word be say . 
too many time for too many angry man . 
oh , let it never be again .
