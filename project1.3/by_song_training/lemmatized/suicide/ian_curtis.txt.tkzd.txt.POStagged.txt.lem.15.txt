#warsaw i be there in the backstage when the first light come around . 
i grow up like a changeling to win the first time around . 
i can see all the weakness . 
i pick all the fault . 
well , i concede all the faith test just to stick in you throat . 
31g , 31g , 31g . 
i hang around in you soundtrack to mirror all this you 've do , to find the right side of reason , to kill the three lie for one . 
i can see all the cold fact . 
i can see through you eye . 
all this talk make no contact no matter how hard we try . 
31g , 31g , 31g . 
i can still hear the footstep . 
i can see only wall . 
i slide into you man-traps with no hear at all . 
i just see contradiction , have to give up the fight just to live in the past tense , to make believe you be right . 
31g , 31g , 31g .
