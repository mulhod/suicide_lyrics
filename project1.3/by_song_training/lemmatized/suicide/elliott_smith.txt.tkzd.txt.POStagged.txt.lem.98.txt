#everybody care , everybody understand everybody care , everybody understand . 
yes , everybody care about you , yeah , and whether or not you want they to . 
it 's a chemical embrace this kick you in the head to a pure synthetic sympathy this infuriate you totally and a quiet lie this make you want to scream and shout . 
so here i lie dream , look at the brilliant sun rain it guide light upon everyone . 
for a moment 's rest you can lean against the banister after run upstairs again and again from wherever they come to fix you in , but always fear city 's fine follow right behind . 
you get a pretty vision in you head , a pencil full of poison lead , and a sicken smile illegal in every town . 
so here i lie dream , look at the brilliant sun rain it guide light upon everyone . 
here i lie dream , look at the brilliant sun rain it guide light upon everyone . 
you say you mean well .
