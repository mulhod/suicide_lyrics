# no more song hello , hello , hello , be there anybody home ? 
i 've only call to say , i 'm sorry . 
the drum be in the dawn and all the voice go and it seem this there be no more song . 
once i know a girl . 
he be a flower in a flame . 
i love he as the sea sing sadly . 
now the ash of the dream can be find in the magazine and it seem this there be no more song . 
once i know a sage who sing upon the stage . 
he tell about the world , he lover , a ghost without a name , stand rag in the rain and it seem this there be no more song . 
the rebel , they be here . 
they come beside the door . 
they tell me this the moon be bleed . 
then all to me surprise they take away me eye and it seem this there be no more song . 
a star be in the sky . 
it 's time to say goodbye . 
a whale be on the beach . 
he 's dying . 
a white flag in me hand and a white bone in the sand and it seem this there be no more song . 
hello , hello , hello , be there anybody home ? 
i 've only call to say , i 'm sorry . 
the drum be in the dawn and all the voice go and it seem this there be no more song . 
it seem this there be no more song . 
it seem this there be no more song .
