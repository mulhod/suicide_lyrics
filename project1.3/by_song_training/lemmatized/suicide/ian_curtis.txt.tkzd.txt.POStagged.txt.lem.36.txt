and he 's cling to the near passer-by . 
he 's lose control . 
and he give away the secret of he past and say i 've lose control again and of a voice this tell he when and where to act . 
he say i 've lose control again . 
and he turn around and take me by the hand and say i 've lose control again . 
and how i 'll never know just why or understand . 
he say i 've lose control again . 
and he scream out , kick on he side , and say i 've lose control again . 
and seize up on the floor , i think he 'd die .
