# 2:45 be i 'm go out sleepwalk where mute memory start talk . 
the boss this can n't help but hurt you and the pretty thing he make desert you . 
i 'm go out now like a baby , a naive unsatisfiable baby , grab onto whatever 's around for the soar high or the crush down with hide crack this do n't show but this constantly just grow . 
i 'm look for the man this attack me while everybody be laugh at me . 
you beat it in me , this part of you , but i 'm go to split we back in two . 
tire of live in a cloud . 
if you 're go to say shit now , you 'll do it out loud , it 's 2:45 in the morning and i 'm put me on warn for wake up in an unknown place with a recollection you 've half erase , look for somebody 's arm to wave away past harm . 
i 'm walk out on center circle . 
the both of you can just fade to black . 
i 'm walk out on center circle , be push away and i 'll never go back .
