#going down to mississippi i 'm go down to mississippi . 
i 'm go down a southern road and , if you never see me again , remember this i have to go , remember this i have to go . 
it 's a long road down to mississippi . 
it 's a short road back the other way . 
if the cop pull you over to the side of the road , you wo n't have nothing to say .

it 's not trouble this i 'm look for . 
but there 's lot of good work call me down and the wait wo n't do no more . 
no , the wait wo n't do no more .

even though you say the time will change , this time be just too long , this time be just too long . 
so i 'm go down to mississippi . 
i 'm go down a southern road and , if you never see me again , remember this i have to go , remember this i have to go .
