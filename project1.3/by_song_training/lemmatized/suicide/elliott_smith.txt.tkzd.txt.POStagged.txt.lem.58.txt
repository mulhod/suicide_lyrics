#looking over me shoulder wipe out in the city slick , another sick rock 'n roller act like a dick , need cash , burn through the trash this pile up in this place and fill up behind me empty face full of thing this i 'm not to do . 
you come over with all of you friend and all they opinion i do n't want to know and i 'm look over me shoulder , book away with nowhere to go . 
i run down to the corner lot . 
it 's forty-five past two . 
i almost forget to show . 
get a date to make with mr . 
so-and-so , after which i wo n't care when you all start to bitch and moan about be alone . 
you come over with all of you friend and all they opinion i do n't want to know and i 'm look over me shoulder , book away with nowhere to go . 
well , ca n't you just leave me alone ? 
you 've already throw all the stick and stone you have to send me way . 
well , ca n't you just leave it at this and spare we both the bother because i just bounce back , anyway ? 
i get nothing this i want to do more than make another sonnet fuck-you to play whenever you make me life cliche so to fit in some little box with all the label shit you will say to keep confusion away . 
you come over with all of you friend and all they opinion i do n't want to know and i 'm look over me shoulder , book away with nowhere to go . 
you come over with all of you friend and all they opinion i do n't want to know and i 'm look over me shoulder , book away .
