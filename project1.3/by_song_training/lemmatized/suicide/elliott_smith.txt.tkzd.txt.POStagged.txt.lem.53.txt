# a distort reality be now a neccessity to be free i 'm float in a black balloon , o.d . 
on easter afternoon . 
me mama tell me , baby , stay clean . 
there 's no in-between . 
and , all you lady and you gentleman , between be all you 've ever see or be . 
fit poorly and arrange the sight . 
doll it up in virgin white . 
you disappoint me , you people rake in on the world . 
the devil 's script sell you the heart of a blackbird . 
shine on me , baby , because it 's rain in me heart . 
sun be rise on a chop glare . 
rain drop acid blotter in the air . 
a distort reality 's now a necessity to be free . 
so disappoint . 
so , first i put it all down to luck . 
god know why me country do n't give a fuck . 
fuck . 
shine on me , baby , because it 's rain in me heart . 
shine on me , baby , because it 's rain in me heart .
