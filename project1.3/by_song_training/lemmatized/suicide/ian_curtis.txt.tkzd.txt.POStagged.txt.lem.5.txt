# a mean to an end a legacy so far remove one day will be improve . 
eternal right we leave behind . 
we be the well kind . 
two the same . 
set free , too . 
i always look to you . 
i always look to you . 
i always look to you . 
we fight for good , stand side by side , we friendship never die . 
on stranger wave , the low and high , we vision touch the sky . 
immortalists with point to prove . 
i put me trust in you . 
i put me trust in you . 
i put me trust in you . 
a house somewhere on foreign soil , where ageless lover call . 
be this you goal , you final need , where dog and vulture eat ? 
commit still , i turn to go . 
i put me trust in you . 
i put me trust in you . 
i put me trust in you . 
i put me trust in you , in you , in you , in you . 
put me trust in you , in you .
