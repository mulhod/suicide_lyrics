#lounge act truth cover in security . 
i ca n't let you smother me . 
i 'd like to , but it can n't work . 
trade off and take turn , i do n't regret a thing and i 've get this friend , you see , who make me feel and i want more than i can steal . 
i 'll arrest me . 
i 'll wear a shield . 
i 'll go out of me way to prove i still , i still smell he on you . 
do n't tell me what i want to hear . 
afraid of never know fear .

i 'll keep fight jealousy until it 's fuck go . 
and i 've get this friend , you see , who make me feel and i want more than i can steal . 
i 'll arrest me . 
i 'll wear a shield . 
i 'll go out of me way to prove i still , i still smell he on you .
