#condor avenue he take the oldsmobile out past condor avenue and he lock the car and slip past into rhythmic quietude , light burn , voice dry and hoarse . 
i throw the screen door like a bastard back and forth . 
the chime fall over each other . 
i fall onto me knee . 
the sound of the car drive off make me feel diseased , a sick shout like you hear at the fairground . 
now i 'm pick up to put away anything of you this 's still around . 
i do n't know what to do with you clothe or you letter . 
it 'll make a whisper out of you . 
he take the oldsmobile out past condor avenue . 
the fairground 's light , a drink man sit by the gate he 's drive through , get he hat tip , bottle back in between he teeth . 
look like he 's bury in the sand at the beach . 
i ca n't think about you drive off to leave barely awake to take a little nap while the road be straight . 
i wish this car have never be discover . 
they take away the bottle and the hat he be under . 
this 's the one thing this he can never do and it 'll make a whisper out of you . 
he take the oldsmobile out past condor avenue . 
cop be run around the scene , look for some kind of clue . 
they never get uptight when a moth get crush , unless a lightbulb really love he very much . 
i 'm lie down , blow smoke from me cigarette , little whisper smoke-signs this you 'll never get . 
you 're in you oldsmobile drive by the moon , headlight burn bright ahead of you . 
and someone 's burn out , out on condor avenue , try to make a whisper out of you . 
what a shitty thing to say . 
do you really mean it ? 
you never say a word to me about what pass between we , so now i 'm leave you alone . 
you can do whatever the hell you want to .
