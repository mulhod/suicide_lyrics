#waltz # 1st every time the day darken down and go away , picture open in me head of me and you , silent and cliche , all the thing we do and do n't say , cover up by what we do and do n't do , go through every out i use to cop to make the repetition stop . 
what be i suppose to say ? 
now i never leave me zone . 
we 're both alone . 
i 'm go home . 
i wish i 'd never see you face .
