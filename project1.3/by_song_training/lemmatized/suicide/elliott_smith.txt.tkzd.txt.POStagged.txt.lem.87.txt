#tomorrow tomorrow everybody know which way you go , straight to over . 
no one want to see you inside of me , straight to over . 
i hear the hammer at the lock say you 're deaf and dumb and do . 
give you another talk . 
this time make it sound like someone . 
the noise be come out and , if it 's not out now , then tomorrow , tomorrow . 
they take you life apart and call you failure 's art . 
they be wrong , though . 
they wo n't know till tomorrow . 
i get static in me head , the reflect sound of everything . 
try to go to where it lead , but it do n't lead to anything . 
the noise be come out and , if it 's not out now , i know it 's just about to drown tomorrow out .
