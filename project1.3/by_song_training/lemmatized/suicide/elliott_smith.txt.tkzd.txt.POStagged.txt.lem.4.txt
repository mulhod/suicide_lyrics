#between the bar drink up , baby , stay up all night . 
the thing you can do , you wo n't but you may . 
the potential you 'll be this you 'll never see . 
the promise you 'll only make . 
drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of day . 
do what i say and i 'll make you okay and drive they away , the image stick in you head . 
people you 've be before this you do n't want around anymore this push and shove and wo n't bend to you will . 
i 'll keep they still drink up , baby , look at the star . 
i 'll kiss you again between the bar where i 'm see you there with you hand in the air wait to finally be catch . 
drink up one more time and i 'll make you me , keep you apart deep in me heart separate from the rest where i like you the well and keep the thing you forget . 
the people you 've be before this you do n't want around anymore this push and shove and wo n't bend to you will . 
i 'll keep they still .
