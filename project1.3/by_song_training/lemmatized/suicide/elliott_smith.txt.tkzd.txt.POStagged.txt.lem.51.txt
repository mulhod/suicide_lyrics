#memory lane this be the place you 'll end up when you lose the chase where you 're drag against you will from a basement on the hill and all anybody know be you 're not like they and they kick you in the head and send you back to be . 
isolation pull you past a tunnel to a bright world where you can make a place to stay , but everybody 's scare of this place . 
they 're stay away , you little house on memory lane . 
the mayor 's name be fear . 
he force patrol the pier from a mountain of cliche this advance everyday . 
the doctor speak a cloud . 
he rain out loud . 
you 'll keep you door and window shut and swear you 'll never show a soul again , but isolation push you till every muscle ache down the only road it ever take , but everybody 's scare of this place . 
they 're stay away , you little house on memory lane . 
if it 's you decision to be open about you , be careful or else , be careful or else . 
uncomfortable apart , it 's all write on me chart . 
and i take what 's give to me more cooperatively . 
i do what people say and lie in be all day absolutely horrify . 
i hope you 're satisfy . 
isolation push past self-hatred , guilt , and shame to a place where suffer be just a game , but everybody 's scare of this place . 
they 're stay away , you little house on memory lane , you little house on memory lane .
