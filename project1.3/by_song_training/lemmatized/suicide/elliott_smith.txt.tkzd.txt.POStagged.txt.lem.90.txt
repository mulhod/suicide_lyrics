#pitseleh i 'll tell you why i do n't want to know where you be . 
i get a joke i be dying to tell you . 
a silent kid be look down the barrel to make the noise this i keep so quiet . 
i keep it from you , pitseleh . 
i 'm not what 's miss from you life now . 
i can never be the puzzle piece . 
they say this god make problem just to see what you can stand before you do as the devil please and give up the thing you love , but no one deserve it . 
the first time i see you i know it will never last . 
i 'm not half what i wish i be . 
i 'm so angry . 
i do n't think it 'll ever pass . 
and i be bad news for you just because i never mean to hurt you .
