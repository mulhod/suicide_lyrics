#strung out again you get what you see . 
i see a rich fuck give charity , see an evil emperor wear me clothe . 
they 're far from the well , but they may suit you well than the rest . 
just look in the mirror will make you a brave man . 
i know me place . 
i hate me face . 
i know how i begin and how i 'll end , string out again . 
be a parliament of owl fly over a city of canal , float on the body , float in the dalles . 
you get what you see . 
some thing , they just change invisiabally . 
i do n't know where i 'm go . 
i do n't even want to know . 
i know me place . 
i hate me face . 
i know how i begin and how i 'll end , string out again , stand , smile on some fantasy island , wave at me lose reflection again , but a tide come in and i 'm string out again , string out again .
