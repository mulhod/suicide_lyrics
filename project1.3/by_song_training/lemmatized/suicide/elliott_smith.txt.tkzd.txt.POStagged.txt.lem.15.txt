#clementine they 're wake you up to close the bar . 
the street 's wet . 
you can tell by the sound of the car . 
the bartender 's sing clementine while he 's turn around the open sign . 
dreadful sorry , clementine . 
though you 're still he man , it seem a long time go . 
maybe the whole thing 's wrong . 
what if he think so , but just do n't say so ? 
you drink you into slow-mo , make an angel in the snow . 
anything to pass the time and keep this song out of you mind . 
oh , me darling , oh , me darling , oh , me darling clementine . 
dreadful sorry , clementine .
