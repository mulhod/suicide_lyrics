ides heaven . 
i 've be out haunt the neighborhood and everybody can see i 'm no good when i 'm walk out between park car with me head full of star . 
high on amphetamine , the moon be a lightbulb break . 
it 'll go around with anyone , but it wo n't come down for anyone . 
you think you know what bring me down , this i want this thing you can never allow . 
you see me smile . 
you think it 's a frown turn upside down because everyone be a fuck pro and they all get answer from trouble they 've know and they all get to say what you should and should n't do though they do n't have a clue . 
high on amphetamine , the moon be a lightbulb break . 
it 'll go around with anyone , but it wo n't come down for anyone and i wo n't come down for anyone .
