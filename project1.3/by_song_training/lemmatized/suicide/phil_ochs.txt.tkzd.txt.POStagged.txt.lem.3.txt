the owner of the local store , owner of the local grind , they 're walk on a fine floor . 
sking . 
too white for color town , color town . 
in the early of the day , for the white home they be bind as a janitor , as a maid . 
they leave they place in color town , color town . 
come the even . 
come the wine . 
come the dance music sound . 
liquor know no color line , not even down in color town , color town . 
a prison with no prison guard where no padlock can be find , a jail without cell and bar , but you 'll never escape from color town , color town .
