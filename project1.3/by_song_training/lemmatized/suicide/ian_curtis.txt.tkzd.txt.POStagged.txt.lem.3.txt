#passover this be a crisis i know have to come , destroy the balance i 'd keep , doubt , unsettle , and turn around , wonder what will come next . 
be this the role this you want to live ? 
i be foolish to ask for so much . 
without the protection and infancy 's guard , it all fall apart at first touch . 
watch the reel as it come to a close , brutally take it time . 
people who change for no reason at all . 
it 's happen all of the time . 
can i go on with this train of event disturb and purge me mind ? 
back out of me duty when all 's say and do . 
i know this i 'll lose every time . 
move along in we god-given way . 
safety be sit by the fire , sanctuary from this feverish smile . 
leave with a mark on the door . 
be this the gift this i want to give ? 
"forgive and forget " 's what they teach . 
or pass through the desert and wasteland once more and watch as they drop by the beach . 
this be the crisis i know have to come , destroy the balance i 'd keep , turn around to the next set of life , wonder what will come next .
