#all clean out here come you pride and joy , the comic little drink you call you boy make everybody smile , who take you pretty plan and then become a disappear man after a little while . 
i see you with you makeup run down . 
now , what 's this all about ? 
you say you do n't want anyone around because you 're all clean out . 
you toss the empty beer not really as compose as you appear , an icicle inside , wear clothe this clash , wonder , "is this treasure or be this trash ?" , still try to decide and about 5th o'clock here come you clown with the foot he 's throw down . 
but all you say be you do n't want anyone around . 
come not right now . 
there be not nothing to dream . 
you do n't want to think about it . 
i 'm sorry you seem so stone and i 'm sorry you think you have to hold you tongue when you 're so pretty and smart . 
i 'm see you cave in , become afraid of all this man this you 've give you heart . 
i see you with you makeup run down . 
now , what 's this all about ? 
you say you do n't want anyone around because you 're all clean out , all clean out , all clean out .
