#know one know no one know it . 
no one know it . 
no one know it , no . 
no one know how good i feel when i see you glow . 
no one know it . 
no one know it . 
no one know it , no . 
no one know how good i feel when you let it show . 
keep it come . 
keep it long . 
caress me with you body song . 
reach it high with each sigh , know soon this we will fly . 
no one know it . 
no one know it . 
no one know it , no . 
no one know how good i feel when i see you glow . 
no one know it . 
no one know it . 
no one know it , no . 
no one know how good i feel when you let it flow . 
keep it move . 
keep it bright and guide me with you body light . 
come in close with each sigh , know soon this we will fly . 
no one know . 
no one know . 
no one know . 
no one know how good i feel when you let it show . 
no one know . 
no one know how good i feel when you let it flow . 
keep on feel . 
keep it whole and lead me with you body soul . 
take me high with each sigh , know you can make me fly . 
no one know it . 
no one know it . 
no one know it , no . 
no one know how good i feel when i see you glow .
