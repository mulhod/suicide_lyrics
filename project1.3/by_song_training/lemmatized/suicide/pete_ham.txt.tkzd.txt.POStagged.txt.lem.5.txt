#song for a lose friend you have a dream . 
you know you dream so much . 
you have a dream . 
you know it mean so much . 
you 're just a victim of the circumstance . 
i mean , what else can you do ? 
you see you dream and you just take a chance and for a while you dream come true . 
what can you do ? 
you have a goal . 
you know you aim so high . 
you have soul . 
you know you have to try . 
you 're just a victim of the time of day . 
no matter what you say or do , you see you dream and you just take a play and for a while you dream come true . 
what can you do ? 
what can you do ? 
you 're just a victim of the circumstance . 
i mean , what else can you do ? 
you see you dream and you just take a chance and for a while you dream come true . 
what can you do ? 
what can you do ? 
what can you do ? 
what can you do ?
