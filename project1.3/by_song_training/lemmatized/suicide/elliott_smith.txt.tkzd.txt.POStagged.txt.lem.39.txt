#ca n't make a sound i have become a silent movie . 
the hero kill the clown . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
nobody know what he 's do still hang around . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
the slow motion move me . 
the monologue mean nothing to me . 
bore in the role , but he ca n't stop stand up to sit back down or lose the one thing find , spin the world like a toy top till there 's a ghost in every town . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
ca n't make a sound . 
eye lock and shine . 
ca n't you tell me what 's happen ? 
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ? 
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ? 
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ? 
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
