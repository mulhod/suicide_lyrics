#leaders of man bear from some mother 's womb , just like any other room . 
make a promise for a new life . 
make a victim out of you life . 
when you time 's on the door and it drip to the floor and you feel you can touch , all the noise be too much and the seed this be sow be no long you own . 
just a minor operation to force a final ultimatum . 
thousand word be speak loud reach the dumb to fool the crowd . 
when you walk down the street and the sound 's not so sweet and you wish you can hide , maybe go for a ride to some peep-show arcade , where the future 's not make . 
a nightmare situation infiltrate imagination , smack of past holy war by the wall with break law . 
the leader of man , bear out of you frustration . 
the leader of man , just a strange infatuation . 
the leader of man make a promise for a new life , no saviour for we sake to twist the internee of hate , self-induced manipulation to crush all thought of mass salvation .
