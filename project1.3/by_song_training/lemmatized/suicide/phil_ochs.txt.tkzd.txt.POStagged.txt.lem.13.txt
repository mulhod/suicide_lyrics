#city boy i 'm just a city boy , bear and breed . 
it 's a city life i 've lead . 
me pasture be a street . 
i 've never climb a tree , but this 's alright with me because i 'm a city boy . 
i 'm just a city boy , bear and raise . 
from this rooftop i have gaze , where the grass be make of steel . 
i 've never plow a field . 
until the pavement start to peel , i 'll be a city boy . 
i 'm just a city boy , bear and grow . 
this 's all i 've ever know . 
where the light will greet the dawn , there 's a factory for a farm . 
sure , the city have it charm when you 're a city boy .
