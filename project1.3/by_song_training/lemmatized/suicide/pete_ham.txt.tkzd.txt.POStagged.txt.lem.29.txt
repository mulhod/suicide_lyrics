#day after day i remember find out about you . 
every day me mind be all around you . 
look out from me lonely room day after day . 
bring it home , baby . 
make it soon . 
i give me love to you . 
i remember hold you while you sleep. every day i feel the tear this you weep. look out of me lonely gloom day after day . 
bring it home , baby . 
make it soon . 
i give me love to you . 
look out of me lonely room day after day . 
bring it home , baby . 
make it soon . 
i give me love to you . 
i remember find out about you . 
every day me mind be all around you . 
look out of me lonely gloom day after day . 
bring it home , baby . 
make it soon . 
i give me love to you .
