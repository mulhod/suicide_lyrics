#one way ticket home i 'd like a one-way ticket home , ticket home , where i can watch television , talk on the telephone . 
but every town i wander there 's a billboard on a throne . 
ticket home , i want a ticket home . 
do anybody know me name or recognize me face ? 
i must have come from somewhere , but i ca n't recall the place . 
they drop me at the matinee . 
they leave without a trace . 
ticket home , i want a ticket home . 
elvis presley be the king . 
i be at he crown . 
me life just flash before me eye . 
i must be drown . 
seem like only yesterday i climb aboard the plane , rape distance in the sky , while dive in champagne . 
i will be in exile now , but everywhere 's the same . 
ticket home , i want a ticket home .
