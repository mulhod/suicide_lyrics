#watford john you show me all you love . 
then you turn and tell me no! 
open up you arm and let it go . 
you give me all you kiss . 
then you freeze and stop the flow . 
open up you knee and let it go . 
i do n't want a cinderella . 
i just want me teddy bear . 
i do n't want a backstage bella . 
i just want to take you there . 
baby , wo n't you think it over ? 
try and see me point of view . 
let it go . 
you show me all you love . 
then you turn and tell me no! 
open up you arm and let it go , let it go , let it go . 
i do n't want a cinderella . 
i just want me teddy bear . 
i do n't want a backstage bella . 
i just want to take you there . 
baby , wo n't you think it over ? 
try and see me point of view . 
come on , baby , wo n't you tell me no! 
bop bop-a-lop do-wop . 
let it go , let it go , let it go . 
let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go . 
let it go , let it go . 
let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go .
