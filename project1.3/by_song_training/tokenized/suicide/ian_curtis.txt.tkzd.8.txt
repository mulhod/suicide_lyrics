# the eternal

procession moves on .
the shouting is over .
praise to the glory of loved ones now gone .
talking aloud as they sit around their tables , scattering flowers washed down by the rain .
stood by the gate at the foot of the garden , watching them pass like clouds in the sky .
try to cry out in the heat of the moment , possessed by a fury that burns from inside .
cry like a child , though these years make me older .
with children my time is so wastefully spent , a burden to keep , though their inner communion .
accept like a curse , an unlucky deal .
played by the gate at the foot of the garden .
my view stretches out from the fence to the wall .
no words could explain .
no actions determine .
just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall .
