#either/or

you 're strong .
you 're stubborn now in an endless symbolic war , brave or bored , either/or .
sometimes i ricochet from the past and at times a future i 've already had before , champion or chore , either/or .
i 'll write the pages you rip out back in their places again .
one day you 'll know what you 're talking about .
i can hardly imagine , but until then i 'll be filling in these blanks that you create every time you win some petty score posing as hardcore , oh , yeah , either/or .
look at the spin chief , battered and broken , clutching a plastic rose .
we 're all in the downpour you carry around for trashing a lifestyle you 've never known .
it 's a useful dream that makes quite an entertaining show and not much more up against and for , either/or .
