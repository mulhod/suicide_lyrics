#disorder

i 've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand .
could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man ?
these sensations barely interest me for another day .
i 've got the spirit .
lose the feeling .
take the shock away .
it 's getting faster , moving faster now .
it 's getting out of hand .
on the tenth floor , down the back stairs , it 's a no man 's land .
lights are flashing .
cars are crashing , getting frequent now .
i 've got the spirit .
lose the feeling .
let it out somehow .
what means to you .
what means to me .
and we will meet again .
i 'm watching you .
i 'm watching her .
i 'll take no pity from you friends .
who is right ?
who can tell ?
and who gives a damn right now ?
until the spirit new sensation takes hold , then you know .
until the spirit new sensation takes hold , then you know .
until the spirit new sensation takes hold , then you know .
i 've got the spirit , but lose the feeling .
i 've got the spirit , but lose the feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling .
