what 's a season in a right if you ca n't have anything ?
what 's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything ?
what 's the meaning in a crime ?
it 's a fan if anything .
where 's the learning in a line ?
it 's a brand .
it 's a brand .
how a culture comes again .
it was all here yesterday and you swear it 's not a trend .
does n't matter anyway .
there 's only here to talk to friends .
nothing new is every day .
you could shit upon the stage .
they 'll be fans .
they 'll be fans .
they 'll be fans .
they 'll be fans .
all the kids will eat it up if it 's packaged properly .
steal a sound and imitate .
keep a format equally , not an ode , just the facts , where our world is nowadays .
an idea is what we lack .
it does n't matter anyways .
all the kids will eat it up if it 's packaged properly .
steal a sound and imitate .
keep a format equally , not an ode , just the facts , where our world is nowadays .
an idea is what we lack .
it does n't matter anyways .
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey .
