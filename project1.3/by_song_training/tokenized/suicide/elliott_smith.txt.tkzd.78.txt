#roman candle

he played himself , did n't need me to give him hell .
he could be cool and cruel to you and me , knew we 'd put up with anything .
i want to hurt him .
i want to give him pain .
i 'm a roman candle .
my head is full of flames .
i 'm hallucinating , hallucinating .
i hear you cry .
your tears are cheap , wet , hot red swollen cheeks .
fall alseep.
i want to hurt him .
i want to give him pain .
i 'm a roman candle .
my head is full of flames .
i want to hurt him .
i want to hurt him .
i want to hurt him .
i want to give him pain and make him feel this pretty burn .
