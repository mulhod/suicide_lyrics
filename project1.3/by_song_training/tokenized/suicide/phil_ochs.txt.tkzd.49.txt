#hills of west virginia

from the flat plains of ohio we drifted out one day for the southern part of the journey .
underneath the bridge , the ohio river sang as we headed for the hills of west virginia .
and the red sun of the morning was smiling through the trees as the darkness of the night was quickly fading and the fog hugged the road like a cloudy , cloudy sea as we drove though the hills of west virginia .
we smoked the tobacco and drank of the wine and we spoke of the forest we were passing .
and the road would wind and wind and wind when we drove through the hills of west virginia .
among all the wealth of the beauty that we passed , there was many old shacks growing older .
and we saw the broken bottles laying on the grass when we drove though the hills of west virginia .
the virginia people watched as we went riding by .
oh , proud as a boulder they were standing .
and we wondered at each other with a meeting of the eye when we drove thought the hills of west virginia .
and once in a while we would stop by the road and gaze at the womb of the valley , almost wishing for a path down below , where we stopped in the hills of west virginia .
up and down and all around we took our restless ride and the rocks , they were staring cold and jagged , where explosions of the powder had torn away the side , where we drove through the hills of west virginia .
and the orange sun was falling on the southern border-line as the shadows of the night were now returning .
