#thirteen

wo n't you let me walk you home from school ?
wo n't you let me meet you at the pool ?
maybe friday i can get tickets from the dance and i 'll take you , ooh , ooh , ooh .
wo n't you tell your dad get off my back ?
tell him what we said about "paint it black" .
rock and roll is here to stay .
well , come inside while it 's ok and i 'll shake you , ooh , ooh , ooh .
wo n't you tell me what you 're thinking of ?
would you be an outlaw for my love ?
if it 's so , well , let me know .
if it 's no , well , i can go .
i wo n't make you , ooh , ooh , ooh .
