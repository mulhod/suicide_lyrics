#half right

well , you should n't doctor yourself .
well , i pictured somebody else , someone that looks like what i look like .
would you say that the one of your dreams got in you and ripped out the seams ?
that 's what i 'd say .
that 's what i 'd say .
he was a sucker for your double-dose .
motherfucker turned white as a ghost .
do n't you say hi .
do n't you say hi .
with a broken sink for a face and a head that just takes up space , he 's not half right , he 's not half right .
it 's already half past and it wo n't last .
i was sticking up for my friend .
well , there 's nothing much to defend .
it 's a lost fight , it 's a lost fight because , when i talk to you on the phone , well , it 's just like being alone .
it 's not half right .
it 's not half right .
