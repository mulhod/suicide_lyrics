you show me all your loving .
then you turn and tell me no!
open up your arms and let it go .
you give me all your kissing .
then you freeze and stop the flow .
open up your knees and let it go .
i do n't want a cinderella .
i just want my teddy bear .
i do n't want a backstage bella .
i just want to take you there .
baby , wo n't you think it over ?
try and see my point of view .
let it go .
you show me all your loving .
then you turn and tell me no!
open up your arms and let it go , let it go , let it go .
i do n't want a cinderella .
i just want my teddy bear .
i do n't want a backstage bella .
i just want to take you there .
baby , wo n't you think it over ?
try and see my point of view .
come on , baby , wo n't you tell me no!
bop bop-a-lop do-wop .
let it go , let it go , let it go .
let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go .
let it go , let it go .
let it go , let it go , let it go , let it go .
