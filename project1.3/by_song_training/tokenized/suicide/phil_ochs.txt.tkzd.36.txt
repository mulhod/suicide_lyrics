#chords of fame

i found him by the stage last night .
he was breathing his last breath .
a bottle of gin and a cigarette was all that he had left .
i can see you make the music because you carry a guitar , but , god , help the troubadour who tries to be a star .
so play the chords of love , my friend .
play the chords of pain .
if you want to keep your song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chords of fame .
i 've seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world .
when they find their melody , they 're surrounded by the girls .
but it all fades so quickly , like a sunny summer day .
reporters ask you questions .
they write down what you say .
so play the chords of love , my friend .
play the chords of pain .
if you want to keep your song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chords of fame .
so play the chords of love , my friend .
play the chords of pain .
if you want to keep your song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chords of fame .
they will rob you of your innocence .
they will put you up for sale .
more that you will find success , the more that you will fail .
i 've been around .
i 've had my share and i really ca n't complain , but i wonder who i left behind the other side of fame .
so play the chords of love , my friend .
play the chords of pain .
if you want to keep your song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chords of fame .
