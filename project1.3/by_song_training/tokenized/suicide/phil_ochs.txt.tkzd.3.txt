#colored town

just across the railroad tracks , on the far side of the town , all the people there are black and they live in colored town , colored town .
speeding cars down the highway run .
they never stop to look around .
one place that the highway shuns and that place is colored town , colored town .
on the sidewalk children play .
in the gutters watch them clown .
white world is so far away , so far away from colored town , colored town .
the owners of the local stores , owners of the local ground , they 're walking on a finer floor .
sking . too white for colored town , colored town .
in the early of the day , for the white homes they are bound as a janitor , as a maid .
they leave their place in colored town , colored town .
come the evening .
come the wine .
come the dancing music sound .
liquor knows no color line , not even down in colored town , colored town .
a prison with no prison guards where no padlocks can be found , a jail without cells and bars , but you 'll never escape from colored town , colored town .
come , let 's open all the doors from birmingham to harlem 's ground , from jackson to chicago 's shores .
let 's take a look at colored town , colored town .
come take a look at colored town , colored town .
