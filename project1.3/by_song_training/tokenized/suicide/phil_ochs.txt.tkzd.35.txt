#gas station women

everything is going wrong .
everything is bad .
there 's no one i can talk to when i am feeling sad .
she broke my heart a million ways .
i 'm losing all my friends .
the boys down at the factory ask me where i 've been .
fill her up with love , please , wo n't you , mister ?
just the hi-test is what i used to say , but that was before i lost my baby .
i 'll have a dollar 's worth of regular today .
i never should have left my home , never left the farm , but the city was excitin .
it could n't do me any harm .
the more folks i run across , the less i seem to know .
the days go by too quickly .
the nights go by too slow .
fill her up with love , please , wo n't you , mister ?
just the hi-test is what i used to say , but that was before i lost my baby .
i 'll have a dollar 's worth of regular today .
i cannot face another girl .
i believe i 'll turn to drink , so i wo n't remember , so i wo n't have to think .
tomorrow will bring happiness or at least another day , so i will bid farewell and i 'll be on my way .
fill her up with love , please , wo n't you , mister ?
just the hi-test is what i used to say , but that was before i lost my baby .
i 'll have a dollar 's worth of regular today .
