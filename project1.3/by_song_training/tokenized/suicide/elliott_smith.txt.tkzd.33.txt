#easy way out

you 'll take advantage till you think you 're being used because without an enemy your anger gets confused .
i got stuck on the side you know i never chose , but it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
there 's no escape for you , except in someone else , although you 've already disappeared within yourself , the invisible man who 's always changing clothes .
it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
while i watch you making mistakes , i wish you luck , i really do with the problem , with the puzzle , whatever 's left of you .
i heard you found another audience to bore , a creative thinker who imagined you were more , a new body for you to push around and pose .
it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
