#angel in the snow

i 'd say you make a perfect angel in the snow , all crushed out on the way you are .
better stop before it goes too far .
do n't you know that i love you ?
sometimes i feel like only a cold , still life that fell down here to lay beside you .
do n't you know that i love you ?
sometimes i feel like only a cold , still life , only a frozen , still life that fell down here to lay beside you .
