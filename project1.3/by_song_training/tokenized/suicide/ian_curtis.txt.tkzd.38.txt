#wilderness

i travelled far and wide throguh many different times .
what did you see there ?
i saw the saints with their toys .
what did you see there ?
i saw all knowledge destroyed .
i travelled far and wide through many different times .
i travelled far and wide through prisons of the cross .
what did you see there ?
the power and glory of sin .
what did you see there ?
the blood of christ on their skins .
i travelled far and wide through many different times .
i travelled far and wide and unknown martyrs died .
what did you see there ?
i saw the one-sided trials .
what did you see there ?
i saw the tears as they cried .
they had tears in their eyes , tears in their eyes , tears in their eyes , tears in their eyes .
