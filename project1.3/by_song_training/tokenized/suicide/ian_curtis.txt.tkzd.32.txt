#day of the lords

this is the room , the start of it all , no portrait so fine , only sheets on the wall .
i 've seen the nights filled with blood-sport and pain and the bodies obtained , the bodies obtained .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
these are your friends from childhood , through youth , who goaded you on , demanded more proof .
withdrawal pain is hard .
it can do you right in , so distorted and thin , distorted and thin .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
this is the car at the edge of the road .
there 's nothing disturbed .
all the windows are closed .
i guess you were right when we talked in the heat .
there 's no room for the weak , no room for the weak .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
this is the room , the start of it all .
through childhood , thrugh youth , i remember it all .
oh , i 've seen the nights filled with blood-sport and pain and the bodies obtained , the bodies obtained , the bodies obtained .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
