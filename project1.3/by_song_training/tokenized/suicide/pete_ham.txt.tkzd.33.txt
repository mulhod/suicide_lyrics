#dennis

deeper waters flowed .
recently it showed .
trying to cover your head .
trying to frighten you .
trying to fight with you .
really getting you scared .
but do n't you worry , you love of mine .
pretty soon it will all be fine and we 'll just go on , higher hills to climb , climbing all the time , trying to find a way through , falling down again on the ground again , wondering what you can do .
but do n't you worry , you love of ours .
they look like weeds , but they 're really flowers and they 'll soon be gone .
you wo n't stand up .
you wo n't sit down .
your head 's a mile above the ground .
and , though we tend to scold you now , i could n't start to tell you how , we could n't start to tell you how there 's just no way to say how much we love you , you , little dennis , you .
you 're full of new surprise .
love you .
you , little dennis with the rascal in your eyes , you 're a prize .
it could be bad .
it could be worse .
you 're taking out your mother 's purse .
and , though you cried when you got told the money there was for the old to keep their dogs from getting cold , the only thing that ca n't be sold is love .
you , little dennis , you , you 're full of new surprise .
love you .
you , little dennis with the rascal in your eyes .
will you pick up your toys ?
will you be a good boy ?
will you please , please ?
there 's a way .
there 's a way .
if you 'll play , if you 'll stay , there 's a way through .
there 's a way to take away blue , take away blue .
there 's a way .
there 's a way .
if you 'll play , if you 'll stay , there 's a way through , there 's a way to .
