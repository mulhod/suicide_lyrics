#ballad of oxford ( jimmy meredith )

i 'll sing you a song about a southern town where the devil had his rule , when marshals faced an angry mob to send one man to school .
his name was jimmy meredith , the tide he helped to turn for he chose to stay on that terrible day the land was soon to learn .
there was blood , red blood , on their hands , yellow dirt on their clothes .
what they thought they were doing only god and the devil knows .
there was hate , cold hate , in their hearts , shot from their souls like a gun , and , as they threw their stones and bricks , they screamed , " see what you have done ! "
the governor made a promise he would keep the trouble down , but , when the mob got ugly , no troopers could be found and men were filled with hate and fear .
they screamed into the night .
the rebel flag waved in the air , the symbol of states ' rights .
there was blood , red blood , on their hands , yellow dirt on their clothes .
what they thought they were doing only god and the devil knows .
there was hate , cold hate , in their hearts , shot from their souls like a gun , and , as they threw their stones and bricks , they screamed , " see what you have done ! "
gas was fired into the mob after each attack and , though the gas was running low , they never fired back .
and , when the smoke had cleared and the fury felt its pain , two men were dead and a hundred bled .
the south had risen again .
so listen mr barnet and mr walker , too .
the times are changing mighty fast .
they 'll roll right over you .
but someday you 'll head for the south , to the southern tip of hell and it 's hot down there , white-hot down there .
let 's hear your rebel yell !
there was blood , red blood , on their hands , yellow dirt on their clothes .
what they thought they were doing only god and the devil knows .
there was hate , cold hate , in their hearts , shot from their souls like a gun , and , as they threw their stones and bricks , they screamed , " see what you have done ! "
" see what you have done ! "
