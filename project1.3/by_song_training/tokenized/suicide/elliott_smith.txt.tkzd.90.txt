#pitseleh

i 'll tell you why i do n't want to know where you are .
i got a joke i been dying to tell you .
a silent kid is looking down the barrel to make the noise that i kept so quiet .
i kept it from you , pitseleh .
i 'm not what 's missing from your life now .
i could never be the puzzle pieces .
they say that god makes problems just to see what you can stand before you do as the devil pleases and give up the thing you love , but no one deserves it .
the first time i saw you i knew it would never last .
i 'm not half what i wish i was .
i 'm so angry .
i do n't think it 'll ever pass .
and i was bad news for you just because i never meant to hurt you .
