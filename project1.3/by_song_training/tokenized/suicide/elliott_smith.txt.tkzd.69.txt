#placeholder

looking at all the rows , all these records look like big zeros .
got your picture on the back of a forty-five , a placeholder till you take up mine , a placeholder till you take up mine .
i 'm the person you 'll never need , the biggest loser on sixteenth street , the invisible man with the see-through mind , a placeholder till you take up mine , a placeholder till you take up mine .
break off in someone 's laughter every time i 'm there next to the square .
he likes the way that you look now like an open book .
just like my favorite song , some pretty words that did n't last that long , like a package sent priority overnight .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
