#i miss you

though you 've been gone for just a week , it makes me feel so sad to speak .
lady , come back .
i miss you .
and , though before i did n't cry , now my eyes are never dry and a thousand jesters could n't make me smile .
i miss you .
i miss you .
and now i know that i was wrong , but it 's too late for now you 've gone .
lady , come back .
i miss you .
and , though our times were good and bad , now you 're gone , i 'm always sad and a thousand jesters could n't make me smile .
i miss you .
i miss you .
i miss you .
