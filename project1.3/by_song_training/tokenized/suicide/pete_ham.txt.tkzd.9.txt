#midnight sun

oh , no , oh , no , i think it 's time for me to run .
well , i 've been working all the summer , waiting for the winter to come and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .
oh , yeah , oh , yeah , i think i 've been away too long .
well , i 've been coming and i 'm going .
all the time is growing with fun and , if you feel like something 's missing , well , come into the midnight sun .
never be a gooseberry for gooseberries should never see it .
drop the one who 's looking at you looking at the one who 's seeing you be it .
oh , yeah , oh , yeah , i think i 've been away too long .
well , i 've been waiting all the summer , counting all the trophies i 've won and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .
oh no , oh no , i think it 's time for me to run .
well , i 've been working all the summer , waiting for the winter to come and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .
and , if you feel like something 's missing , well , come into the midnight sun .
and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .
