#crimson ship

my life was colored , painting pictures out of tune .
you came from nowhere in a song .
it might have been the way i laughed .
he made the jokes could only show me what was wrong .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
he never left me his number .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
then he was gone and i wondered .
who put the knots on all the crosses on the hill ?
why did the old man wash his hands ?
who grew the flower that was big enough to kill and blew the trumpet in the van ?
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
he never left me his number .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
then he was gone and i wondered .
oh , oh , oh , oh .
when they were busy throwing kisses at the moon , a father lost his mother 's son and , though they knew the resurrection would be soon , the time was spent .
they carried on , on .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
he never left me his number .
he took me flying on his crimson ship
then he was gone and i wondered , wondered , wondered , wondered .
