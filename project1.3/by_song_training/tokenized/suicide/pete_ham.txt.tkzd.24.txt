# we 're for the dark

tell me the day and i 'll set you free , what you want to be .
show me the way and i 'll let you see what you do to me .
well , it 's not enough to live .
if you 're going to take , then you have to give .
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i .
show me the clouds and i 'll give you sky if you want me to .
show me the crowds and i 'll make you sigh if you take me through .
well , it 's not enough to be .
if you 're going to look , then you have to see .
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i .
show me the way and i 'll set you free , what you ought to be .
tell me the day and i 'll let you see what you do to me .
well , it 's not enough to live .
if you 're going to take , then you have to give .
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i .
show me the clouds and i 'll give you sky if you want me to .
show me the crowds and i 'll make you cry if you take me through .
well , it 's not enough to be .
if you gotta look , then you have to see .
we 're for the dark , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i , baby , you and i .
