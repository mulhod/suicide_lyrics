#lonely you

when i look into your tearful eyes , i do n't know what to do .
and , though you say that i do n't realize , i sympathize with you .
lonely you , only you .
yes , i do .
lonely you , only you .
lonely you .
when i ask you just to be my friend , i want to lend a hand , but , if we get too close , it 's sure to end .
oh , ca n't you understand ?
lonely you , only you .
yes , it will .
lonely you , only you .
lonely you .
we really need a friend and friends are hard to find and harder still to keep.
lonely you .
lonely me .
lonely you , only you .
yes , it will .
lonely you , only you .
lonely you .
lonely you .
lonely you .
