#in the heat of the summer

in the heat of the summer , when the pavements were burning , the soul of a city was ravaged in the night after the city sun was sinking .
why , the windows were shattered , but deep in the dark someone set the spark and then it no longer mattered .
all the tempers were raging .
oh , where , oh , where are the white silver tongues who forgot to listen to the warnings ?
no longer following reason and all the stores were the target now where just the other day they were buying .
drunk with the lure of the looting and the memory of the uniforms shoving with their sticks , asking , "are you looking for trouble ? "
"it 's not the way of the order .
oh , stay in your homes .
please leave us alone .
we 'll be glad to talk in the morning . "
"why the hurry to your hunger ?
now the rubble 's resting on your broken streets , so you see what your rage has unraveled " .
bricks were heavily flying and the loudspeaker drowned like a whispering sound when compared to the angered emotions .
and the shame was replacing the anger , so wrong , so wrong , but we 've been down so long and we had to make somebody listen in the heat of the summer .
