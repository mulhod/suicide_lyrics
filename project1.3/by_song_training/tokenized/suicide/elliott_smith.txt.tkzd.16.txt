#southern belle

killing a southern belle is all you know how to do , that and give other people hell .
it 's what they expect from you too , but i would n't have you how you want .
i do n't want to walk around .
i do n't even want to breathe .
i live in a southern town where all you can do is grit your teeth , but i would n't have you how you want .
how come you 're not ashamed of what you are ?
and sorry that you 're the one she got ?
be not nobody talking now , nobody .
nothing 's said .
no one 's about to shout .
nobody 's seen red , but i would n't have you how you want .
you 're killing a southern belle , killing a southern belle , killing a southern belle .
