#pretty (ugly before )

sunshine been keeping me up for days .
there is no night-time , it 's only a passing phase .
and i feel pretty , pretty enough for you .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
sometimes is all i feel up to now , but it 's not worth it to you because you got to get high somehow .
is it destruction that you require to feel , like somebody wants you , someone that 's more for real ?
sunshine been keeping me up for days .
there is no night-time , only a passing phase .
and i 'll feel pretty another hour or two .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
ugly before .
