atrocity exhibition

asylums with doors open wide where people had paid to see inside .
for entertainment they watch his body twist .
behind his eyes he says , 'i still exist . '
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
in arenas he kills for a prize , wins a minute to add to his life , but the sickness is drowned by cries for more .
pray to god .
make it quick .
watch him fall .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
this is the way .
this is the way .
this is the way .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
you 'll see the horrors of a faraway place , meet the architects of law face to face , see mass murder on a scale you 've never seen , and all the ones who try hard to succeed .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
and i picked on the whims of a thousand or more , still pursuing the path that 's been buried for years , all the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire , ca n't replace or relate , ca n't release or repair .
take my hand and i 'll show you what was and will be .
