#give it a try

give it a try and we can make it so high .
you 'll never feel this way again .
wipe off your sorrow and pain .
come into my heart .
just give it the time .
should work out fine .
we can make it .
we can break it .
it 's not a command .
just give me your hand .
we can break it .
whoa , oh , we can take it , take it .
give it a try and then change your desire .
you 'll never make love on your own now that the love seed is sown .
do n't put out the fire .
give it the time .
we can work out fine .
we can make it .
we can break it .
it 's not a command .
baby , give me your hand .
we can break it .
we can take it .
give it a try and we can make it so high .
you 'll never feel this way again .
wipe off your sorrow and pain .
come into my heart .
give it a try and then change your desire .
you 'll never make love on your own now that the love seed is sown .
do n't put out the fire , yea !
