# jim dean of indiana

it was on an indiana farm in the middle of the country , growing in the fields of grain , jim dean of indiana .
his mother died when he was a boy .
his father was a stranger .
marcus winslow took him in .
nobody seemed to want him .
the hired man sang like a storm .
sometimes he 'd beat him because he would never do the chores .
he was lost in dreaming .
he never seemed to find a play with the flatlands and the farmers , so he had to leave one day , he said to be an actor .
once he 'd come back to the farm with starlets from the stages .
they locked themselves inside his room .
the people turned their faces .
a neighbor ran from the movie-house .
chickens they were scattered .
he swore he saw upon the screen , jim dean of indiana .
he played a boy without a home , torn with no tomorrow , reaching out to touch someone , a stranger in the shadow .
the winslows left for the movie town .
they drove across the country .
they hoped that he would stay around and they hoped he would be friendly .
he talked to them for half an hour , but he was busy racing .
he left for the grapevine road 1 .
they left for indiana .
then marcus heard on the radio that a movie-star was dying .
he turned the tuner way down low , so ortense could go on sleeping .
it was not until they reached the farm where the hired man was waiting .
the wind rushed silent through the grain .
it was just as they had told him .
they buried him just down the road , a mile from the farmhouse .
that is where i placed a flower for jim dean of indiana .
