#i ca n't take it

just give me five so i can step outside
or even give me three and i 'll be satisfied
but if you give me none at all
you 're going to see me climb that wall
and you know you 're going to see me fall
and i ca n't take it

take all the nights that a man can give and make all the days so a man can live , but , if you take up every hour , you 're going to take up all my power and you know you 're going to turn me sour and i ca n't take it , no .
i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
give me all your money in your dark brown vase .
you 've even got my soul in your dark brown case , but , baby , ca n't you see outside ?
you know you 've got my fingers tied and you know you 're going to hurt my pride and i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
give me all your money in your dark brown vase .
you 've even got my soul in your dark brown case , but , baby , ca n't you see outside when you know you 've got my fingers tied and you know you 're going to hurt my pride and i ca n't take it ?
i ca n't take it , oh , no .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
i ca n't take it , oh , no .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
