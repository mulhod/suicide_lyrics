# no matter what

no matter what you are i will always be with you .
does n't matter what you do , girl .
oh , girl , with you .
no matter what you do i will always be around .
wo n't you tell me what you found , girl ?
oh , girl , wo n't you ?
knock down the old gray wall and be a part of it all .
nothing to say .
nothing to see .
nothing to do .
if you would give me all as i would give it to you , nothing would be , nothing would be , nothing would be .
no matter where you go there will always be a place .
ca n't you see it in my face , girl ?
oh , girl , want you .
knock down the old gray wall .
be a part of it all .
nothing to say .
nothing to see .
nothing to do .
if you would give me all as i would give it to you , nothing would be , nothing would be , nothing would be .
no matter what you are i will always be with you .
does n't matter what you do , girl .
oh , girl , with you .
oh , girl , you girl .
want you .
oh , girl , you girl .
want you .
