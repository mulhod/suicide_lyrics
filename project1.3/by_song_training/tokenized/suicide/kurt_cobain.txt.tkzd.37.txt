#on a plain

i 'll start this off without any words .
i got so high that i scratched till i bled .
i love myself better than you .
i know it 's wrong , so what should i do ?
the finest day that i ever had was when i learned to cry on command .
i love myself better than you .
i know it 's wrong , so what should i do ?
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
i 'm on a plain .
my mother died every night , it 's safe to say .
do n't quote me on that .
i love myself better than you .
i know it 's wrong , so what should i do ?
the black sheep got blackmailed again , forgot to put on the zip code .
i love myself better than you .
i know it 's wrong , so what should i do ?
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
i 'm on a plain .
somewhere i have heard this before , in a dream of memory restored .
as a defense i 'm neutered and spayed .
what the hell am i trying to say ?
it is now time to make it unclear , to write off lines that do n't make sense .
i love myself better than you .
i know it 's wrong , so what should i do ?
and one more special message to go and then i 'm done .
then i can go home .
i love myself better than you .
i know it 's wrong , so what should i do ?
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
i 'm on a plain .
i ca n't complain .
