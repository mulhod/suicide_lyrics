#go by

go on and parade and fade , hit the scene and slow , spending all your time with some girl you 'll never get to know , wound uptight , dressed all in white , blowing out to drift .
need you even here .
you live up in your head , scared of every little noise , someone always breaking in accidentally using nothing but their voice , shrill and small echo down the hall , repeating pet names , sitting in your eyes .
you 're only passing by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
someone 's in the way .
pretty words and inside slurs , all the things they have to say to perform the work that they 've rehearsed .
it 's a waste of time .
i put it behind me once and for all and let the time decline if the problem was n't mine .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
