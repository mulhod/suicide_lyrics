#bach , beethoven , mozart and me

every morning at the dawn dust is in the air .
karen rises early , runs brushes through her hair .
then she buys the paper .
i lay on my back .
then she feeds the monkey .
then she feeds the cat .
i 'll talk .
i 'll talk .
they live by the sea , surrounded by a cemetery .
if you get tired , come up for some tea with bach , beethoven , mozart , and me .
frances is the next to rise .
powders up her nose .
she 's working for the tailor .
makes the western clothes .
andy drives a sports car to the warner brothers ghost .
he used to live in england .
now he loves the coast .
i 'll talk .
i 'll talk .
they live by the sea , surrounded by a cemetery .
if you get tired , come up for some tea with bach , beethoven , mozart , and me .
sometimes a friend comes by to sing the latest song , but david fights with susan .
nobody gets along .
every other sunday it 's time to make a call .
judy has a barbecue .
play the volleyball .
i 'll talk .
i 'll talk .
they live by the sea , surrounded by a cemetery .
if you get tired , come up for some tea with bach , beethoven , mozart , and me .
in the evening when the sun goes down , the streets are all aglow .
we walk out on the hillside .
city shines below .
we sit down for our supper .
the news begins to play .
walter , he is speechless .
eric speaks cliches .
i 'll talk .
i 'll talk .
they live by the sea , surrounded by a cemetery .
if you get tired , come up for some tea with bach , beethoven , mozart , and me .
andy plays a cricket game .
frances holds a glass .
karen reads and darns a dress .
i dream of the past .
dark is spreading up now .
good evening , goodnight .
karen turns the bed sheet .
she 's turning out the light .
i 'll talk .
i 'll talk .
they live by the sea , surrounded by a cemetery .
if you get tired , come up for some tea with bach , beethoven , mozart , and me .
