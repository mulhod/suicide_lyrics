#ten cents a coup

it was a used car dealer 's election and the choice was rather small .
the boys agreed , "it 's the war we need , so there 's no president at all . "
here 's to nixon and agnew .
they are the stars of the stage and screen .
not since laurel and hardy have i laughed so hard i screamed .
i thought that johnson was the devil .
i thought we could n't do no worse .
now the white house stands in disneyland .
this country must be under a curse .
here 's to nixon and agnew .
they are the stars of the stage and screen .
not since laurel and hardy have i laughed so hard i screamed .
i dreamed that nixon died of a sun-tan .
there was only spiro left .
at his swearing-in , he fell on his chin .
he assassinated himself .
here 's to nixon and agnew .
they are the stars of the stage and screen .
not since laurel and hardy have i laughed so hard i screamed .
