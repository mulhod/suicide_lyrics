#march of the pigs

step right up , march , push , crawl right up on your knees , please , greed , feed ( no time to hesitate ) .
i want a little bit .
i want a piece of it .
i think he 's losing it .
i want to watch it come down .
do n't like the look of it .
do n't like the taste of it .
do n't like the smell of it .
i want to watch it come down .
all the pigs are all lined up .
i give you all that you want .
take the skin and peel it back .
now does n't that make you feel better ?
shove it up inside , surprise !
lies .
stains like the blood on your teeth .
bite , chew , suck , away the tender parts .
i want to break it up .
i want to smash it up .
i want to fuck it up .
i want to watch it come down .
maybe afraid of it .
let 's discredit it .
let 's pick away at it .
i want to watch it come down .
all the pigs are all lined up .
i give you al that you want .
take the skin and peel it back .
now does n't that make you feel better ?
the pigs have won tonight .
now they can all sleep soundly .
and everything is all right .
