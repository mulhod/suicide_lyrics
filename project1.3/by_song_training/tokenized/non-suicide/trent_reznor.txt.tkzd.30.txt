#burn

this world rejects me .
this world threw me away .
this world never gave me a chance .
this world going to have to pay .
well i do n't believe in your institutions .
i did what you wanted me to .
and like the cancer in your system .
i 've got a little surprise for you .
something inside of me has opened up its eyes .
why did you put it there ?
did you not realise ?
this thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound .
sometimes i think i could .
burn .
burn .
i look down there where you 're standing .
flock of sheep all on display .
with all your lies piled up around you .
i can take it all away .
something inside of me has opened up its eyes .
why did you put it there ?
did you not realise ?
this thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound .
sometimes i think i could .
i 'm going to burn this whole world down .
i 'm going to burn this whole world down .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i am your savior .
i am corruption .
i am the angel of your destruction .
i am perversion , secret desire .
i am your future swallowed up in fire .
