#she belongs to me

she 's got everything she needs .
she 's an artist .
she do n't look back ,
she 's got everything she needs .
she 's an artist .
she do n't look back .
she can take the dark out of the night-time and paint the day-time black .
you will start out standing , proud to steal her anything she sees .
you will start out standing , proud to steal her anything she sees , but you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees .
she never stumbles .
she 's got no place to fall .
she never stumbles .
she 's got no place to fall .
she 's nobody 's child .
the law ca n't touch her at all .
she wears an egyptian ring .
it sparkles before she speaks .
she wears an egyptian ring .
it sparkles before she speaks .
she 's a hypnotist collector .
you are a walking antique .
bow down to her on sunday .
salute her when her birthday comes .
bow down to her on sunday .
salute her when her birthday comes .
for halloween buy her a trumpet and for christmas give her a drum .
