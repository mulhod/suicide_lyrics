#winterlude

winterlude , winterlude , oh , darling , winterlude by the road tonight .
tonight there will be no quarreling .
everything is going to be alright .
oh , i see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine .
you 're the one i adore , come over here and give me more .
winterlude , this dude thinks you 're fine .
winterlude , winterlude , my little apple , winterlude by the corn in the field .
winterlude , let 's go down to the chapel .
then come back and cook up a meal .
well , come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign .
the snow is so cold , but our love can be bold .
winterlude , this dude thinks you 're fine .
winterlude , winterlude , my little daisy , winterlude by the telephone wire .
winterlude , it 's making me lazy .
come on , sit by the logs in the fire .
the moonlight reflects from the window , where the snowflakes , they cover the sand .
come out tonight .
everything 'll be tight .
winterlude , this dude thinks you 're grand .
