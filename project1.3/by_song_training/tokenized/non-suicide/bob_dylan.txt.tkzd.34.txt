#shelter from the storm

'twas in another lifetime , one of toil and blood , when blackness was a virtue , the road was full of mud .
i came in from the wilderness a creature void of form .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
and , if i pass this way again , you can rest assured .
i 'll always do my best for her .
on that i give my word .
in a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm , " come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
not a word was spoke between us .
there was little risk involved .
everything up to that point had been left unresolved .
try imagining a place where it 's always safe and warm .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
i was burned out from exhaustion , buried in the hail , poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail , hunted like a crocodile , ravaged in the corn .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
suddenly i turned around and she was standing there with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair .
she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
now there 's a wall between us .
something there 's been lost .
i took too much for granted .
i got my signals crossed .
just to think that it all began on a non-eventful morn .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
well , the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount , but nothing really matters much .
it 's doom alone that counts .
and the one-eyed undertaker , he blows a futile horn .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
i 've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove and old men with broken teeth , stranded without love .
do i understand your question , man ?
is it hopeless and forlorn ?
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
in a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes .
i bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose .
i offered up my innocence .
i got repaid with scorn .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
well , i 'm living in a foreign country , but i 'm bound to cross the line .
beauty walks a razor 's edge .
some day i 'll make it mine .
if i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born .
" come in , " she said .
"i'll give you shelter from the storm . "
