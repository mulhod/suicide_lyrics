#reach for the sky

when i was young i was invincible .
i found myself not thinking twice .
i never thought about no future , it 's just a roll of the dice .
but the day may come when you got something to lose , and just when you think you 're done paying dues , you say to yourself : "dear , god what have i done ? " and hope its not too late , cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
yesterday is history , and tomorrow is a mystery .
but baby right now , it 's just about you and me .
you can run , you can hide , just like bonnie and clyde .
reach for the sky be not never going to die .
and i thank the lord for the love that i have found , and hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
so if you please take this moment , try if you can to make it last .
do n't think about no future , and just forget about the past .
and make it last .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky i be not never going down .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky i be not never coming down .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky i be not never going down .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
