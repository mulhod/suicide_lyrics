extraordinary machine

i certainly have n't been shopping for any new shoes , and i certainly have n't been spreading myself around .
i still only travel by foot , and by foot it 's a slow climb , but i 'm good at being uncomfortable , so i ca n't stop changing all the time .
i notice that my opponent is always on the go , and wo n't go slow , so 's not to focus , and i notice he 'll hitch a ride with any guide , as long as they go fast from whence he came , but he 's no good at being uncomfortable , so he ca n't stop staying exactly the same .
if there was a better way to go then it would find me .
i ca n't help it , the road just rolls out behind me .
be kind to me , or treat me mean .
i 'll make the most of it , i 'm an extraordinary machine .
i seem to you to seek a new disaster every day .
you deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay .
i mean to prove , i mean to move in my own way , and say i 've been getting along for long before you came into the play .
i am the baby of the family , it happens , so everybody cares and wears the sheeps ' clothes while they chaperone .
curious , you looking down your nose at me , while you appease courteous , to try and help , but let me set your mind at ease .
if there was a better way to go then it would find me .
i ca n't help it , the road just rolls out behind me .
be kind to me , or treat me mean .
i 'll make the most of it , i 'm an extraordinary machine .
do i so worry you , you need to hurry to my side ?
it 's very kind , but it 's to no avail ; i do n't want the bail .
i promise you , everything will be just fine .
if there was a better way to go then it would find me .
i ca n't help it , the road just rolls out behind me .
be kind to me , or treat me mean .
i 'll make the most of it , i 'm an extraordinary machine .
