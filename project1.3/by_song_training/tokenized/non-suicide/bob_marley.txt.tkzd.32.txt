#waiting in vain

one , two , three .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
from the very first time i rest my eyes on you , girl , my heart says follow through .
but i know , now , that i 'm way down on your line , but the waiting feel is fine .
so do n't treat me like a puppet on a string , because i know i have to do my thing .
do n't talk to me as if you think i 'm dumb .
i want to know when you 're going to come , soon .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
because if summer is here , i 'm still waiting there .
winter is here , and i 'm still waiting there .
like i said : it 's been three years since i 'm knocking on your door , and i still can knock some more .
ooh , girl , ooh , girl , is it feasible ?
i want to know now , for i to knock some more .
you see , in life i know there 's lots of grief , but your love is my relief .
tears in my eyes burn , tears in my eyes burn , while i 'm waiting , while i 'm waiting for my turn .
see !
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love .
i do n't want to wait in vain for your love , oh !
i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to wait in vain .
i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to wait in vain .
no , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to , i do n't want to wait in vain .
