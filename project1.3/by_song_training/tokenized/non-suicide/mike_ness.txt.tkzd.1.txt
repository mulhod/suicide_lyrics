california ( hustle and flow )

running around like you 're front page news , lonely eyes and your motorcycle boots .
tattooed heart and your jet-black hair , running round like you do n't care .
take me down , take me on down the line .
well , i was born , babe , with nothing to lose , but the black man taught me how to sing the blues .
made a little life outta rock and roll and that crazy california hustle and flow .
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
i went too fast with that rhythm and booze almost ended up dead like all those other fools .
everyone 's got some sort of ball and chain .
what 's life without a little pain ?
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
living in a hollywood movie dream , and i 'm still reaching for the stars .
life gets hard and then it gets good .
like i always knew it would .
running around like you 're front page news , lonely eyes and your motorcycle boots .
tattooed heart and your jet-black hair , running round like you do n't care .
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
