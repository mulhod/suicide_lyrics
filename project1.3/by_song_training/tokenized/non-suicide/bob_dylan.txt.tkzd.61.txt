#drifter 's escape

"oh , help me in my weakness , " i heard the drifter say as they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away .
"my trip has n't been a pleasant one and my time , it is n't long and i still do not know what it was that i 've done wrong . "
well , the judge , he cast his robe aside .
a tear came to his eye .
"you 'd fail to understand , " he said .
"why must you even try ? "
outside the crowd was stirring .
you could hear it from the door .
inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more .
"oh , stop that cursed jury ! " cried the attendant and the nurse .
" the trial was bad enough , but this is ten times worse . "
just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape and , while everybody knelt to pray , the drifter did escape .
