#never is a promise

you 'll never see the courage i know .
its colors ' richness wo n't appear within your view .
i 'll never glow the way that you glow .
your presence dominates the judgements made on you , but as the scenery grows , i see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception .
my feelings swell and stretch .
i see from greater heights .
i understand what i am still too proud to mention to you .
you 'll say you understand , but you do n't understand .
you 'll say you 'd never give up seeing eye to eye , but never is a promise and you ca n't afford to lie .
you 'll never touch these things that i hold .
the skin of my emotions lies beneath my own .
you 'll never feel the heat of this soul .
my fever burns me deeper than i 've ever shown to you .
you 'll say : do n't fear your dreams .
it 's easier than it seems .
you 'll say you 'd never let me fall from hopes so high , but never is a promise and you ca n't afford to lie .
you 'll never live the life that i live .
i 'll never live the life that wakes me in the night .
you 'll never hear the message i give .
you 'll say it looks as though i might give up this fight , but as the scenery grows , i see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception .
my feelings swell and stretch .
i see from greater heights .
i realise what i am now too smart to mention to you .
you 'll say you understand .
you 'll never understand .
i 'll say i 'll never wake up knowing how or why .
i do n't know what to believe in .
you wo n't know who i am .
you 'll say i need appeasing when i start to cry , but never is a promise and i 'll never need a lie .
