#pale september

pale september .
i wore the time like a dress that year .
the autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin .
but as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappearred , my heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within .
but then he rose , brilliant as the moon in full , and sank in the burrows of my keep.
and all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet .
and my winter giving way to warm as i 'm singing him to sleep.
he goes along just as a water lily , gentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floats unweighed down by passion or intensity , yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts .
and he finds a home in me for what misfortune sows he knows my touch will reap .
and all my armour falling down in a pile at me feet .
and my winter giving way to warm as i 'm singing him to sleep.
all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet .
and my winter giving way to warm as i 'm singing him to sleep.
