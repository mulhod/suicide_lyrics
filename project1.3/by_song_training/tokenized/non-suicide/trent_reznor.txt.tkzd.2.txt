#last

gave up trying to figure out when my head got lost along the way .
worn out from giving it up , and my soul i pissed it all away .
still stings these shattered nerves , pigs we get what pigs deserve .
i 'm going all the way down i 'm leaving today .
come , come , come on you 've got to fill me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
come , come , come on , you 're got to fix me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
still feel it all slipping away , but it does n't matter anymore .
everybody 's still chipping away , but it does n't matter anymore .
look through these blackened eyes ; you 'll see ten thousand lies .
come , come , come on you 've got to fill me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
come , come , come on , you 're got to fix me up .
come , come , got to let me get through to you .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
i know it 's all getting away , and it comes to me as no surprise .
i know what 's coming to me , and is never going to arrive .
fresh blood through tired skin , new sweat to drown me in .
dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive .
come , come , come on you 've got to fill me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
come , come , come on , you 're got to fix me up .
come , come , got to let me get through to you .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
i wish i could put the blame on you .
i want you to make me , i want you to take me , i want you to break me , then i want you to throw me away .
i want you to make me , i want you to take me , i want you to break me , then i want you to throw me away .
