the hysterical bride in the penny arcade , screaming , she moans , "i have just been made ! "
then sends out for the doctor , who pulls down the shade and says , "my advice is to not let the boys in . "
now , the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside .
he walks with a swagger and he says to the bride , " stop all this weeping .
swallow your pride .
you will not die .
it 's not poison ! "

well , john the baptist , after torturing a thief , looks up at his hero , the commander-in-chief , saying , "tell me , great hero , but please make it brief , is there a hole for me to get sick in ? "
the commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly , saying , "death to all those who would whimper and cry ! "
and , dropping a barbell , he points to the sky , saying , " the sun 's not yellow .
it 's chicken ! "

where ma rainey and beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll , tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole and the national bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul to the old folks ' home and the college .
i wish i could write you a melody so plain that could hold you , dear lady , from going insane , that could ease you and cool you and cease the pain of your useless and pointless knowledge .
mama 's in the factory .
she be not got no shoes .
daddy 's in the alley .
he 's looking for food .
i 'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues .
