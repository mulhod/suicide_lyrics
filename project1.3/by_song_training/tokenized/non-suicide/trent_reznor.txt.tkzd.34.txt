# the good soldier

gun fire in the street where we used to meet echos out a beat , and the bass goes ...
bomb , right over my head , step over the dead .
remember what you said , you know , the part about life is just a waking dream , well i know what you mean , but that be not how it seems right here right now .
how can all this be real ?
i can barely feel anymore .
i am trying to see .
i am trying to believe .
this is not where i should be .
i am trying to believe .
blood hardens in the sand .
cold metal in my hand may help you understand the way that things are going to be .
there 's nowhere else to hide cause god is on our side , i keep telling myself .
i am trying to see .
i am trying to believe .
this is not where i should be .
i am trying to believe .
