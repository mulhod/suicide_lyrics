# the child is gone

darling , give me your absence tonight .
take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white .
let me sink in the silence that echoes inside , and do n't bother leaving the light on because i suddenly feel like a different person .
from the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion , and i ran my hand o 'er a strange inversion , a vacancy that just did not belong .
the child is gone .
honey help me out of this mess .
i 'm a stranger to myself but do n't reach for me .
i 'm too far away .
i do n't want to talk because there 's nothing left to say .
so my darling , give me your absence tonight .
take all of your sympathy and leave it outside because there 's no kind of loving that can make this all right .
i 'm trying to find a place i belong , and i suddenly feel like a different person .
from the roots of my soul come a gentle coersion , and i ran my hand o 'er a strange inversion .
as the darkness turns into the dawn , the child is gone , the child is gone .
