#get him back

one man , he disappoint me .
he give me the gouge and he take my glee .
now every other man i see remind me of the one man who disappoint me .
but wait till i get him back .
he wo n't have a back to scratch .
yeah , keep turning that chin and you will see my face as i figure how to kill what i cannot catch .
so i say , and on i go to another one to disappoint me so .
next one up , a contemptible snob .
he live to put things in their place .
he did a commendable job .
he put himself so low , he can hardly even look me in the face .
o , he made my blood just burn .
i flipped so far , i thought that i would not return .
but the last one i had who was getting my hopes up , i might 've been a little fast to dismiss .
i think he let me down , when he did n't disappoint me .
he did n't always guess right , but he usually got my gist .
so wait till i get him back .
i 'm going to bring him home , and i 'll watch him unpack .
yeah keep turning that chin , and you will see my face is fixed on the one i 'm going to get back .
i 'm going to get him back , i am .
i 'm going to get him back , i really am .
