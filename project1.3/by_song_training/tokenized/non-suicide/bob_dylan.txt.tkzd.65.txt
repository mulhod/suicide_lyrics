# the wicked messenger

there was a wicked messenger .
from eli he did come with a mind that multiplied the smallest matter .
when questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb for his tongue , it could not speak but only flatter .
he stayed behind the assembly hall .
it was there he made his bed .
oftentimes he could be seen returning until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand , which read , " the soles of my feet , i swear they 're burning . "
oh , the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part and the people that confronted him were many .
and he was told but these few words , which opened up his heart .
"if ye cannot bring good news , then do n't bring any . "
