#angel 's wings

you say you 're down on your luck .
hey baby , it 's a long , long way up .
hold back now , hold back your fears .
you say you 're really down and out , and you feel like there 's no way out now .
let go now , let go of your tears some more .
how many times have you asked yourself : is this the hand of fate now that i 've been dealt ?
you 're so disillusioned , this ca n't be real , and you ca n't stand now the way you feel .
i do n't care about what they say .
i wo n't live or die that way .
tired of figuring out things on my own .
angel 's wings , wo n't you carry me home .
and when you 're down on your luck , hey baby , it 's a long , long way up .
hold back now , hold back your fears .
and when you 're really down and out , and you feel like there 's no way out now .
let go now , let go of your tears some more .
and when you 're down on your luck , hey baby , it 's a long , long way up .
hold back now , hold back your fears .
and when you 're really down and out , and you feel like there 's no way out now .
let go now , let go of your tears some more .
i triumphed in the face of adversity , and i became the man i never thought i 'd be .
and now my biggest challenge , a thing called love .
i guess i 'm not as tough as i thought i was .
i do n't care about what they say , i 'm going to marry you some day .
go ahead and wake up , it 's a brand new day .
angel 's wings going to carry you away .
angel 's wings going to carry me away .
angel 's wings going to carry us away , going to carry us away , going to carry us away , going to carry us away .
