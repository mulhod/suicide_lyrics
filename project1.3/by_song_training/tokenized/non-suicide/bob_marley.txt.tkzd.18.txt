#burning and looting

this morning i woke up in a curfew .
oh , god , i was a prisoner , too , yeah !
could not recognize the faces standing over me .
they were all dressed in uniforms of brutality , eh !
how many rivers do we have to cross , before we can talk to the boss , eh ?
all that we got , it seems we have lost .
we must have really paid the cost .
that 's why we going to be burning and looting tonight .
say we going to burn and loot .
burning and looting tonight .
one more thing : burning all pollution tonight .
oh , yeah , yeah , burning all illusion tonight .
oh , stop them !
give me the food and let me grow .
let the roots man take a blow .
all them drugs going to make you slow now .
it 's not the music of the ghetto , eh !
weeping and wailing tonight .
who can stop the tears ?
weeping and wailing tonight .
we 've been suffering these long , long years !
weeping and wailing tonight .
will you say cheer ?
weeping and wailing tonight , but where ?
give me the food and let me grow .
let the roots man take a blow .
i must say : all them , all them drugs going to make you slow .
it 's not the music of the ghetto .
we going to be burning and looting tonight .
to survive , yeah !
burning and looting tonight .
save your baby lives .
burning all pollution tonight .
pollution , yeah , yeah !
burning all illusion tonight , lord , lord , lord , lord !
burning and looting tonight .
burning and looting tonight .
