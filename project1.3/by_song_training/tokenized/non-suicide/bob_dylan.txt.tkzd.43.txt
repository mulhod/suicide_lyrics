#mr . tambourine man

hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
i 'm not sleepy and there is no place i 'm going to .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come following you .
though i know that evening 's empire has returned into sand , vanished from my hand , left me blindly here to stand , but still not sleeping , my weariness amazes me , i 'm branded on my feet , i have no one to meet , and the ancient , empty street 's too dead for dreaming .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
i 'm not sleepy and there is no place i 'm going to .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come following you .
take me on a trip upon your magic , swirling ship .
my senses have been stripped .
my hands ca n't feel to grip .
my toes , too numb to step , wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering .
i 'm ready to go anywhere .
i 'm ready for to fade into my own parade .
cast your dancing spell my way , i promise to go under it .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
i 'm not sleepy and there is no place i 'm going to .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come following you .
though you might hear laughing , spinning , swinging madly across the sun , it 's not aimed at anyone , it 's just escaping on the run , and but for the sky there are no fences facing .
and , if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme to your tambourine in time , it 's just a ragged clown behind .
i would n't pay it any mind .
it 's just a shadow you 're seeing that he 's chasing .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
i 'm not sleepy and there is no place i 'm going to .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come following you .
and take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind , down the foggy ruins of time , far past the frozen leaves , the haunted , frightened trees , out to the windy beach , far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow .
yes , to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free , silhouetted by the sea , circled by the circus sands , with all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves , let me forget about today until tomorrow .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
i 'm not sleepy and there is no place i 'm going to .
hey , mr . tambourine man , play a song for me .
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come following you .
