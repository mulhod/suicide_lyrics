#subterranean homesick blues

johnny 's in the basement , mixing up the medicine .
i 'm on the pavement , thinking about the government .
the man in the trench coat , badge out , laid off , says he 's got a bad cough , wants to get it paid off .
look out , kid , it 's something you did .
god knows when , but you 're doing it again .
you better duck down the alleyway , looking for a new friend .
the man in the coon-skin cap in the pigpen wants eleven dollar bills .
you only got ten .
maggie comes fleet-foot , face full of black soot , talking that the heat put plants in the bed , but the phone 's tapped , anyway .
maggie says that many say they must bust in early may , orders from the d.a .
look out , kid , do n't matter what you did .
do n't walk on your tip-toes , do n't try no doz , better stay away from those that carry around a fire-hose , keep a clean nose , watch the plain clothes .
you do n't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows .
ah , get sick , get well , hang around the ink-well , ring bell , hard to tell if anything is going to sell , try hard , get barred , get back , write braille , get jailed , jump bail , join the army if you fail .
look out , kid , you 're going to get hit by losers , cheaters , six-time users hanging around the theaters .
girl by the whirlpool 's looking for a new fool .
do n't follow leaders , watch the parking meters .
oh , get born , keep warm , short pants , romance , learn to dance , get dressed , get blessed , try to be a success , please her , please him , buy gifts , do n't steal , do n't lift .
twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift .
look out , kid , they keep it all hid .
better jump down a manhole , light yourself a candle , do n't wear sandals , and try to avoid the scandals .
do n't want to be a bum ?
you better chew gum ,
the pump do n't work because the vandals took the handles .
