#never say goodbye

twilight on the frozen lake , a north wind about to break on footprints in the snow and silence down below .
you 're beautiful beyond words .
you 're beautiful to me .
you could make me cry .
never say goodbye because my dreams are made of iron and steel with a big bouquet of the roses hanging down from the heavens to the ground .
the crashing waves roll over me as i stand upon the sand and wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand .
oh , baby , baby , baby blue , you 'll change your last name too .
you 've turned your hair to brown .
love to see it hanging down .
