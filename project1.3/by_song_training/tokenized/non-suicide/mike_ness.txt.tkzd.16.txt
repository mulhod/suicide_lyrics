#live before you die

when pressures up , and the stress is high , and i want to bid this world good bye , i 'm going to bury my frustrations , grab some of life 's satisfactions , yeah , i 'm going to live before i die .
i try to find some peace of mind when my life 's treating me unkind .
pain will be my motivation .
i 'm going to use my imagination .
yeah , i 'm going to live before i die .
so close your eyes , and embrace your memories .
leave your troubles and your worries far behind .
stop contemplating and start celebrating .
yeah , you got to live before you die .
i think of chances i did n't take .
i try to learn from my mistakes , yeah .
i 'm tired of being pushed around now .
life be not going to drag me down now .
yeah , i 'm going to live before i die .
so close your eyes , and embrace your memories .
leave your troubles and your worries far behind .
stop contemplating and start celebrating .
yeah , you got to live before you die .
