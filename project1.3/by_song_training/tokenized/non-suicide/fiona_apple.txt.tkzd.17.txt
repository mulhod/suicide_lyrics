#slow like honey

you moved like honey in my dream last night .
yeah , some old fires were burning .
you came near to me and you endeared to me , but you could n't quit discern me .
does that scare you ?
i 'll let you run away , but your heart will not oblige you .
you 'll remember me like a melody .
yeah , i 'll haunt the world inside you .
and my big secret : going to win you over , slow like honey , heavy with mood .
i 'll let you see me .
i 'll covet your regard .
i 'll invade your demeanor , and you 'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze .
and you 'll wonder what it is about me .
it 's my big secre : keeping you coming , slow like honey , heavy with mood .
though dreams can be deceiving , like faces are to hearts , they serve for sweet relieving when fantasy and reality lie too far apart .
so i stretch myself across like a bridge , and i pull you to the edge and stand there waiting , trying to attain the end to satisfy the story .
shall i release you ?
must i release you as i rise to meet my glory ?
but my big secret , going to hover over your life , going to keep you reaching , when i 'm gone like yesterday , when i 'm high like heaven , when i 'm strong like music , because i 'm slow like honey , and heavy with mood .
