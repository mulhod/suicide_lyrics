#i shall be free no.10

i 'm just average , common too .
i 'm just like him , the same as you .
i 'm everybody 's brother and son .
i be not different than anyone !
aing . no use to talk to me .
it 's just the same as talking to you .
i was shadow-boxing early in the day .
i figured i was ready for cassius clay .
i said , "fee , fie , fo , fum .
cassius clay , here i come .
26 , 27 , 28 , 29 .
i 'm going to make your face look just like mine .
5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 .
cassius clay , you 'd better run .
99 , 100 , 101 , 102 .
your ma wo n't even recognize you .
14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
going to knock him clean right out of his spleen ! "
well , i do n't know , but i 've been told the streets of heaven are lined with gold .
i ask you how things could get much worse if the russians happen to get up there first .
wowee !
pretty scary !
now , i 'm liberal , but to a degree .
i want everybody to be free , but , if you think i 'll let barry goldwater move in next door , marry my daughter , you must think i 'm crazy !
i would n't let him do it for all the farms in cuba .
well , i set my monkey on the log and ordered him to do the dog .
he wagged his tail and shook his head and he went and did the cat instead .
he 's a weird monkey , very funky .
i sat with my high-heeled sneakers on , waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun .
i had my white shorts rolled up past my waist and my wig-hat was falling in my face .
but they would n't let me on the tennis court .
i got a woman .
she 's so mean .
she sticks my boots in the washing machine , sticks me with buckshot when i 'm nude , puts bubblegum in my food .
she 's funny , wants my money , calls me "honey " .
now , i got a friend who spends his life stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife , dreams of strangling me with a scarf , when my name comes up , he pretends to barf .
i 've got a million friends !
now , they asked me to read a poem at the sorority sister 's home .
i got knocked down and my head was swimming .
i wound up with the dean of women !
yippee !
i 'm a poet .
i know it .
hope i do n't blow it .
i 'm going to grow my hair down to my feet so strange , so i look like a walking mountain range and i 'm going to ride into omaha on a horse , out to the country club and the golf course .
carry the new york times , shoot a few holes , blow their minds .
now , you 're probably wondering by now just what this song is all about .
what 's probably got you baffled more is what this thing here is for .
it 's nothing .
it 's something i learned over in england .
