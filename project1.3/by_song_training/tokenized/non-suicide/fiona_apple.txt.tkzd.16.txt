#criminal

i 've been a bad , bad girl .
i 've been careless with a delicate man .
and it 's a sad , sad world when a girl will break a boy just because she can .
do n't you tell me to deny it .
i 've done wrong and i want to suffer for my sins .
i 've come to you because i need guidance to be true and i just do n't know where i can begin .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
heaven help me for the way i am .
save me from these evil deeds before i get them done .
i know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand .
but i keep living this day like the next will never come .
oh help me but do n't tell me to deny it .
i 've got to cleanse myself of all these lies till i 'm good enough for him .
i 've got a lot to lose , and i 'm betting high , so i 'm begging you before it ends just tell me where to begin .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
let me know the way before there 's hell to pay .
give me room to lay the law and let me go .
i 've got to make a play to make my lover stay .
so what would an angel say ?
the devil wants to know .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
