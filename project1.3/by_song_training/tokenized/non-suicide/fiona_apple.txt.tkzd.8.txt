#oh well

what you did to me made me see myself something different .
though i try to talk sense to myself , but i just wo n't listen .
wo n't you go away , turn yourself in .
you 're no good at confession .
before the image that you burned me in tries to teach you a lesson .
what you did to me made me see myself something awful .
a voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled .
it took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it .
i spent all i had to get it back , and now it seems i 've been outbidded .
my peace and quiet was stolen from me .
when i was looking with calm affection , you were searching out my imperfections .
what wasted unconditional love on somebody who does n't believe in the stuff .
you came upon me like a hypnic jerk when i was just about settled .
and when it counts you recoil with a cryptic word and leave a love belittled .
oh what a cold and common old way to go .
i was feeding on the need for you to know me ; devastated at the rate you fell below me .
what wasted unconditional love on somebody who does n't believe in the stuff .
oh , well .
