#i was wrong

oh , when i was young i was so full of fear .
i hid behind anger , held back the tears .
it was me against the world .
i was sure that i 'd win , but the world fought back , punished me for my sins .
i felt so alone , so insecure .
i blamed you instead , made sure i was heard , and they tried to warn me of my evil ways but i would n't hear what they had to say .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
i realize now that i was wrong .
and i think about my loves , well , i 've had a few .
well , i 'm sorry that i hurt them .
did i hurt you too ?
i took what i wanted , put my heart on the shelf , but how can you love me when you do n't love yourself ?
it was me against the world .
i was sure that i 'd win .
the world fought back , punished me for my sins and they tried to warn me of my evil ways , but i could n't hear what they had to say .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
i realize now that i was wrong .
i was wrong , yeah , i was wrong .
i grew up fast , and i grew up hard .
something was wrong from the very start .
i was fighting everybody , i was fighting everything , but the only one that i hurt was me .
i got society 's blood running down my face .
somebody help me get outta this place .
how could someone 's bad luck last so long ?
until i realized that i was wrong .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
i realize now that i was wrong .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
the only moment that i was me , i was wrong .
