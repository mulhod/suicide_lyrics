#get gone

how many times do i have to say to get away , get gone .
flip your shit past another lasses ' humble dwelling .
you got your game , made your shot , and you got away with a lot , but i 'm not turned on .
so put away that meat you 're selling .
because i do know what 's good for me , and i 've done what i could for you , but you 're not benefiting , and yet i 'm sitting singing again , sing , sing , again .
how can i deal with this , if he wo n't get with this ?
am i going to heal from this ?
he wo n't admit to it .
nothing to figure out .
i got to get him out .
it 's time the truth was out that he do n't give a shit about me .
because i do know what 's good for me , and i 've done what i could for you , but you 're not benefiting , and yet i 'm sitting singing again , sing , sing again .
how can i deal with this , if he wo n't get with this ?

he wo n't admit to it .
nothing to figure out .
i got to get him out .
it 's time the truth was out that he do n't give a shit about me .
how many times can it escalate till it elevates to a place i ca n't breathe ?
and i must decide , if you must deride , that i 'm much obliged to up and go .
i 'll idealize , then realize that it 's no sacrifice , because the price is paid and there 's nothing left to grieve .
fucking go .
because i 've done what i could for you , and i do know what 's good for me , and i 'm not benefiting , instead i 'm sitting singing again , singing again , singing again , sing , sing , sing again .
