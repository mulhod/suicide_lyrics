#it be not me , babe

go away from my window .
leave at your own chosen speed .
i 'm not the one you want , babe .
i 'm not the one you need .
you say you 're looking for someone who 's never weak , but always strong to protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong , someone to open each and every door , but it be not me , babe .
no , no , no , it be not me , babe .
it be not me you 're looking for , babe .
go lightly from the ledge , babe .
go lightly on the ground .
i 'm not the one you want , babe .
i will only let you down .
you say you 're looking for someone who will promise never to part , someone to close his eyes for you , someone to close his heart , someone who will die for you and more , but it be not me , babe .
no , no , no , it be not me , babe .
it be not me you 're looking for , babe .
go melt back in the night .
everything inside is made of stone .
there 's nothing in here moving and , anyway , i 'm not alone .
you say you 're looking for someone who 'll pick you up each time you fall , to gather flowers constantly , and to come each time you call , a lover for your life and nothing more , but it be not me , babe .
no , no , no , it be not me , babe .
it be not me you 're looking for , babe .
