#gave up

perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most .
forgot how it feels well almost .
no one to blame always the same .
open my eyes .
wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up in flames .
it took you to make me realize .
it took you to make me realize .
it took you to make me realize .
it took you to make me see the light .
smashed up my sanity .
smashed up my integrity .
smashed up what i believed in .
smashed up what 's left of me .
smashed up my everything .
smashed up all that was true .
going to smash myself to pieces , i do n't know what else to do .
covered in hope and vaseline , still cannot fix this broken machine .
watching the hole it used to be mine .
just watching it burn in my steady , systematic decline of the trust i will betray .
give it to me i throw it away .
and after everything i 've done i hate myself for what i 've become .
i tried , i gave up .
i tried , i gave up .
i tried , i gave up .
i tried , and i gave up .
throw it away .
