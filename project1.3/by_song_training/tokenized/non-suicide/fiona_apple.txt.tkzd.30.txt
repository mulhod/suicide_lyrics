# the way things are

i would n't know what to do with another chance if you gave it to me .
i could n't take the embrace of a real romance .
it 'd race right through me .
i 'm much better off the way things are .
much , much better off , better by far , by far .
i would n't know what to say to a gentle voice .
it 'd roll right past me .
and if you chalk it up you 'll see i do n't really have a choice so do n't even ask me .
i 'm much better off the way things are .
much , much better off , better by far .
so keep on calling me names , keep on , keep on , and i 'll keep kicking the crap till it 's gone .
if you keep on killing , you could get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .
how can i fight , when we 're on the same side ?
how can i fight beside you ?
so keep on calling me names , keep on , keep on .
and i 'll keep on kicking the crap till it 's gone .
if you keep on killing , you could get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .
so keep on callng me names , keep on , keep on .
and i 'll keep kicking the crap till it 's gone .
if you keep on killing , you could get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .
