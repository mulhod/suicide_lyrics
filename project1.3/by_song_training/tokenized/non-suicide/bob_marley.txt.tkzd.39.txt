#misty morning

misty morning , do n't see no sun .
i know you 're out there somewhere having fun .
there is one mystery , yeah , i just ca n't express .
to give your more , to receive your less .
one of my good friends said , in a reggae rhythm : "do n't jump in the water , if you ca n't swim . "
the power of philosophy , yeah , floats through my head light like a feather , heavy as lead , light like a feather , heavy as lead , yeah .
see no sun , oh .
time has come .
i want you , i want you to straighten out my tomorrow , uh !
i want , i want , i want you , oh , whoa !
i want you to straighten out my tomorrow !
misty morning , do n't see no sun .
