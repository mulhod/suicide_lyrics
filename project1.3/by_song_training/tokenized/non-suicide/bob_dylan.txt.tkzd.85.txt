#three angels

three angels up above the street , each one playing a horn , dressed in green robes with wings that stick out .
they 've been there since christmas morn .
the wildest cat from montana passes by in a flash , then a lady in a bright orange dress , one u-haul trailer , a truck with no wheels , the tenth avenue bus going west .
the dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around .
a man with a badge skips by .
three fellas crawling on their way back to work .
nobody stops to ask why .
the bakery truck stops outside of that fence where the angels stand high on the poles .
the driver peeks out , trying to find one face in this concrete world full of souls .
the angels play on their horns all day .
the whole earth in progression seems to pass by .
but does anyone hear the music they play ?
does anyone even try ?
