# john wesley harding

john wesley harding was a friend to the poor .
he traveled with a gun in every hand .
all along this countryside he opened many a door , but he was never known to hurt an honest man .
'twas down in chaynee county a time they talk about , with his lady by his side he took a stand and soon the situation there was all but straightened out for he was always known to lend a helping hand .
all across the telegraph his name , it did resound , but no charge held against him could they prove and there was no man around who could track or chain him down .
he was never known to make a foolish move .
