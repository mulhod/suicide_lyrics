#going , going , gone

i 've just reached a place where the willow do n't bend .
there 's not much more to be said .
it 's the top of the end .
i 'm going .
i 'm going .
i 'm gone .
i 'm closing the book on the pages and the text and i do n't really care , ooh , what happens next .
i 'm just going .
i 'm going .
i 'm gone .
i been hanging on the threads .
i been playing it straight .
now i 've just got to cut loose before it gets late .
so i 'm going .
i 'm going .
i 'm gone .
grandma said , "boy , go and follow your heart and you 'll be fine at the end of the line .
all that 's gold does n't shine .
do n't you and your one true love ever part . "
i been walking the road .
i 've been living on the edge .
now i 've just got to go before i get to the ledge .
so i 'm going .
i 'm just going .
i 'm gone .
