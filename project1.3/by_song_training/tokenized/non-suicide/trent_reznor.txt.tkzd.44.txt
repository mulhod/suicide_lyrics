#in this twilight

watch the sun , as it crawls across a final time .
and it feels like , like it was a friend .
it is watching us , and the world we set on fire .
do you wonder if it feels the same ?
and the sky is filled with light .
can you see it ?
all the black is really white , if you believe it .
as your time is running out , let me take away your doubt .
you can find a better a place in this twilight .
from dust to dust , ashes in your hair remind me what it feels like and i wo n't feel again .
night descends .
could i have been a better person ?
if i could only do it all again .
and the sky is filled with light .
do you see it ?
all the black is really white , if you believe it .
and the longing that you feel .
you know none of this is real .
you will find a better a place in this twilight .
