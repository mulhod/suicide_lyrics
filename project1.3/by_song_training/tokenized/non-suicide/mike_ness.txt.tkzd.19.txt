#let it be me

i 've been in love , but now i 'm waiting .
do n't ever want to worry about a thing .
i sit at home and i wonder : will i rise or will i go under .
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely .
let it be me , let it be me , your one and only .
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you .
let it be me , if your feeling blue .
i 've seen you aroud , but you do n't know me .
i 've watched your life , but ca n't always see .
i 'll try and i 'll try girl to love you .
and when we die , you will have loved too .
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely .
let it be me , let it be me , your one and only .
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you .
let it be me , if your feeling blue .
you know your friends talk bad about me .
your folks say it 's not suppose to be .
you know girl your life is going by fast , try to make it last .
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely .
let it be me , let it be me , your one and only .
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you .
let it be me , if your feeling blue .
