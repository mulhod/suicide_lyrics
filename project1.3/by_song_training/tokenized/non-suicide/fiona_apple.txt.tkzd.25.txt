#limp

you want to make me sick .
you want to lick my wounds , do n't you , baby ?
you want the badge of honor when you save my hide , but you 're the one in the way of the day of doom , baby , if you need my shame to reclaim your pride .
and when i think of it , my fingers turn to fists .
i never did anything to you , man .
but no matter what i try , you 'll beat me with your bitter lies , so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; got off now , baby .
it wont be long till you 'll be lying limp in your own hands .
you feed the beast i have within me .
you wave the red flag , baby , you make it run , run , run .
standing on the sidelines , waving and grinning , you fondle my trigger , then you blame my gun .
and when i think of it , my fingers turn to fists .
i never did anything to you , man .
but no matter what i try you 'll beat me with your bitter lies so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; get off now , baby .
it wont be long till you 'll be lying limp in your own hands .
and when i think of it , my fingers turn to fists .
i never did anything to you , man .
but no matter what i try you 'll beat me with your bitter lies so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; get off now , baby .
it wont be long till you 'll be lying limp in your own hands .
