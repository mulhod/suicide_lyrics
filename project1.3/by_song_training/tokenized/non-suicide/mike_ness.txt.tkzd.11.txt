#footprints on my ceiling

everybody wants a lover , nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past .
long ago , without a care , pull gardenias from her hair .
i think of a time we did n't have a care in the world .
captivated by her beauty , i knew it was my life long duty .
she had all the grace and charm of a radiant queen .
how do you talk without speaking ?
how do you hear without listening ?
how do you live without feeling ?
how do you take without giving ?
and keep it all inside ?
there are footprints on my ceiling .
i ca n't help this fucked up feeling .
something 's wrong , you be not coming round here no more .
try to get my thoughts together , i think of a time when things were better this miscommunication is breaking me down .
how do you talk without speaking ?
how do you hear without listening ?
how do you live without feeling ?
how do you take without giving ?
how you treat your new best friend ?
everybody wants a lover .
nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past .
my heart is heavy , slowly sinking .
i redirect my desperate thinking , and kiss her red full lips like i did the very first time .
how do you talk without speaking ?
how do you hear without listening ?
how do you live without feeling ?
how do you take without giving ?
there are footprints on my ceiling .
and i kept it bottled up inside all my life .
