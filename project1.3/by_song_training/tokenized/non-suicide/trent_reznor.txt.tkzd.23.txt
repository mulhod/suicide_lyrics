# the becoming

i beat my machine .
it 's a part of me .
it 's inside of me
i 'm stuck in this dream .
it 's changing me .
i am becoming .
the me that you know had some second thoughts .
he 's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore .
the me that you know does n't come around much .
that part of me is n't here anymore .
all pain disappears .
it 's the nature of , of my circuitry .
drowns out all i hear .
there 's no escape from this , my new consciousness .
the me that you know used to have feelings , but the blood has stopped pumping , and he is left to decay .
the me that you know is now made up of wires .
and even when i 'm right with you , i 'm so far away .
i can try to get away , but iï¿½ve strapped myself in .
i can try to scratch away the sound in my ears .
i can see it killing away all my bad parts .
i do n't want to listen but it 's all too clear .
hiding backwards inside of me i feel so unafraid .
annie , hold a little tighter i might just slip away .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
