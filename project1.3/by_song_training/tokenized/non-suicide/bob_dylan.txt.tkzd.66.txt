#down along the cove

down along the cove i spied my true love coming my way .
down along the cove i spied my true love coming my way .
i said , "lord , have mercy , mama , it sure is good to see you coming today ! "
down along the cove i spied my little bundle of joy .
down along the cove i spied my little bundle of joy .
she said , "lord , have mercy , honey , i 'm so glad you 're my boy ! "
down along the cove we walk together hand in hand .
down along the cove we walk together hand in hand .
everybody watching us go by knows we 're in love .
yes , they understand .
