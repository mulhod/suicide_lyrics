#i pity the poor immigrant

i pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would 've stayed home , who uses all his power to do evil , but in the end is always left so alone , that man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath , who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death .
i pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain , whose heaven is like ironside 's , whose tears are like rain , who eats , but is not satisfied , who hears , but does not see , who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me .
i pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud , who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood , whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass .
i pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass .
