#temporary like achilles

standing on your window , honey , yes , i 've been here before .
feeling so harmless , i 'm looking at your second door .
how come you do n't send me no regards ?
you know i want your loving .
honey , why are you so hard ?
kneeling beneath your ceiling , yes , i guess i 'll be here for a while .
i 'm trying to read your portrait , but i 'm helpless like a rich man 's child .
how come you send someone out to have me barred ?
you know i want your loving .
honey , why are you so hard ?
like a poor fool in his prime , yes , i know you can hear me walk , but is your heart made out of stone or is it lime or is it just solid rock ?
well , i lean into your hallway , lean against your velvet door .
i watch upon your scorpion , who crawls across your circus floor .
just what do you think you have to guard ?
you know i want your loving .
honey , but you 're so hard .
achilles is in your alleyway .
he do n't want me here , he does brag .
he 's pointing to the sky and he 's hungry like a man in drag .
how come you get someone like him to be your guard ?
you know i want your loving .
honey , but you 're so hard .
