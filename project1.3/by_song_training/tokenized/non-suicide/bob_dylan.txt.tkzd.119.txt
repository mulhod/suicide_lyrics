#only a pawn in their game

a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers 's blood .
a finger fired the trigger to his name .
a handle hid out in the dark .
a hand set the spark .
two eyes took the aim behind a man 's brain , but he ca n't be blamed .
he 's only a pawn in their game .
a south politician preaches to the poor white man , "you got more than the blacks .
do n't complain ! "
you 're better than them .
you been born with white skin , they explain .
and the negro 's name is used , it is plain , for the politician 's gain as he rises to fame and the poor white remains on the caboose of the train , but it be not him to blame .
he 's only a pawn in their game .
the deputy sheriffs , the soldiers , the governors get paid and the marshals and cops get the same , but the poor white man 's used in the hands of them all like a tool .
he 's taught in his school from the start by the rule that the laws are with him , to protect his white skin , to keep up his hate , so he never thinks straight about the shape that he 's in , but it be not him to blame .
he 's only a pawn in their game .
from the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks and the hoof-beats pound in his brain and he 's taught how to walk in a pack , shoot in the back with his fist in a clinch , to hang and to lynch , to hide beneath a hood , to kill with no pain like a dog on a chain .
he be not got no name , but it be not him to blame .
he 's only a pawn in their game .
today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught .
they lowered him down as a king .
but , when the shadowy sun sets on the one that fired the gun , he 'll see by his grave on the stone that remains , carved next to his name his epitaph plain , "only a pawn in their game . "
