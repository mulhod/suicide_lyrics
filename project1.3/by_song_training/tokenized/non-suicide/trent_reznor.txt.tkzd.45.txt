#zero-sum

they 're starting to open up the sky .
they 're starting to reach down through .
and it feels like we 're living in that split-second of a car crash .
and time is slowing down .
and if we only had a little more time .
and this time is all there is .
do you remember the time we ...
and all the times we ...
and should have ...
and were going to...
i know , and i know you remember how we could justify it all , and we knew better .
in our hearts we knew better .
and we told ourselves it did n't matter , and we chose to continue , and none of this matters anymore in the hour of our twilight .
and soon it will be all said and done .
and we will all be back together as one .
if we will continue at all .
shame on us , doomed from the start .
may god have mercy on our dirty little hearts .
shame on us for all we 've done , and all we ever were , just zeros and ones .
and you never get away .
and you never get to take the easy way .
and all of this is a consequence brought on by our own hand , if you believe in that sort of thing .
and did you ever really find , when you closed your eyes , any place that was still and at peace ?
and i guess i just wanted to tell you , as the light starts to fade , that you are the reason that i am not afraid .
and i guess i just wanted to mention , as the heavens will fall , we will be together soon if we will be anything at all .
shame on us , doomed from the start .
may god have mercy on our dirty little hearts .
shame on us for all we 've done , and all we ever were , just zeros and ones .
