#most likely you go your way ( and i 'll go mine )

you say you love me and you 're thinking of me , but you know you could be wrong .
you say you told me that you want to hold me , but you know you 're not that strong .
i just ca n't do what i done before .
i just ca n't beg you anymore .
i 'm going to let you pass and i 'll go last .
then time will tell just who has fell and who 's been left behind when you go your way and i go mine .
you say you disturb me and you do n't deserve me , but you know sometimes you lie .
you say you 're shaking and you 're always aching , but you know how hard you try .
sometimes it gets so hard to care .
it ca n't be this way everywhere .
and i 'm going to let you pass .
yes , and i 'll go last .
then time will tell who has fell and who 's been left behind when you go your way and i go mine .
well , the judge , he holds a grudge .
he 's going to call on you .
but he 's badly-built and he walks on stilts .
watch out he do n't fall on you .
you say you 're sorry for telling stories that you know i believe are true .
you say you got some other kind of lover and , yes , i believe you do .
you say my kisses are not like his , but this time i 'm not going to tell you why that is .
i 'm just going to let you pass .
yes , and i 'll go last .
then time will tell who has fell and who 's been left behind when you go your way and i go mine .
