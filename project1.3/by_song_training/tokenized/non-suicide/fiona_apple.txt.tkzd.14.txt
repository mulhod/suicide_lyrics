#sullen girl

days like this i do n't know what to do with myself all day and all night .
i wander the halls along the walls and under my breath i say to myself i need fuel to take flight .
and there 's too much going on , but it 's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion , under the waves in the blue of my oblivion .
is that why they call me a sullen girl , sullen girl .
they do n't know i used to sail the deep and tranquil sea .
but he washed me ashore , and he took my pearl and left an empty shell of me .
and there 's too much going on , but it 's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion , under the waves in the blue of my oblivion , under the waves in the blue of my oblivion .
it 's calm under the waves , in the blue of my oblivion .
