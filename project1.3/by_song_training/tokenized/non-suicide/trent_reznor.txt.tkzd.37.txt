#capital g

i pushed a button and elected him to office , and he pushed a button and it dropped a bomb .
you pushed the button and could watch it on the television .
those motherfuckers did n't last too long , ha ha .
i 'm sick of hearing about the haves and the have-nots .
have some personal accountability .
the biggest problem with the way that we 've been doing things is the more we let you have , the less that i 'll be keeping for me .
well i used to stand for something , now i 'm on my hands and knees .
traded in my god for this one , and he signs his name with a capital g .
do n't give a shit about the temperature in guatemala .
do n't really see what all the fuss is about .
aing . going to worry 'bout no future generations , and i 'm sure somebody going to figure it out .
do n't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person , you have n't had enough to know what it 's like .
you 're only angry cause you wish you were in my position .
now nod your head because you know that i 'm right , alright !
well i used to stand for something , but forgot what that could be .
there 's a lot of me inside you .
maybe you 're afraid to see .
well i used to stand for something , now i 'm on my hands and knees .
traded in my god for this one , and he signs his name with a capital g .
