#billy 7

spend the night with some sweet seï¿½orita , into her dark hall where she will lead you , in some lonesome shadow she might greet you .
billy , you 're so doggone far away from home .
they say that pat garrett 's got your number .
sleep with one eye open when you slumber .
every little sound just might be thunder , thunder from the barrel of his gun .
maybe you will find yourself tomorrow drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow , spending the time that you borrowed , figuring a way to get back home .
