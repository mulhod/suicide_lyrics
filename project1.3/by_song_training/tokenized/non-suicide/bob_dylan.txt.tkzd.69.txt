#peggy day

peggy day stole my poor heart away .
by golly , what more can i say ?
love to spend the night with peggy day .
peggy night makes my future look so bright .
man , that girl is out of sight .
love to spend the day with peggy night .
well , you know , even before i learned her name , you know , i loved her just the same .
and i tell them all wherever i may go just so they 'll know that she 's my little lady and i love her so .
peggy day stole my poor heart away , turned my skies to blue from gray .
love to spend the night with peggy day .
peggy day stole my poor heart away .
by golly , what more can i say ?
love to spend the night with peggy day .
love to spend the night with peggy day .
