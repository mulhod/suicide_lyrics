#down in it

kinda like a cloud , i was up , way up in the sky , and i was feeling some feelings you would n't believe .
sometimes i do n't believe them myself , and i decided i was never coming down .
just then a tiny little dot caught my eye .
it was just about too small to see , but i watched it way too long .
it was pulling me down .
i was up about it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it
i was up above it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it .
well shut up .
so what , what does it matter now ?
i was swimming in the haze now i crawl on the ground .
and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me .
try to laugh about it now , but is n't it funny how everything works out .
"i guess the joke 's on me , " she said .
i was up about it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it
i was up above it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it .
i used to be so big and strong .
i used to know my right from wrong .
i used to never be afraid .
i used to be somebody
i used to have something inside .
now just this hole that 's open wide .
i used to want it all .
i used to be somebody .
i 'll cross my heart and hope to die , but the needle 's already in my eye .
and all the world 's weight is on my back , and i do n't even know why .
and what i used to think was me is just a fading memory .
i looked him right in the eye and said goodbye .
was up about it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it
i was up above it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it .
