#through these eyes

through these eyes i 've seen love and i 've seen hate .
i 've seen the violence and the tears through these eyes .
i got my schooling on the streets .
i 've seen the things in life you do n't want to see .
through these eyes , i 've seen the shape of things to come , and i 've watched them all fall apart , through these eyes .
i 've seen the broken homes , they cry .
i 've seen the poor man 's face as he stands in line .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on .
through these eyes , i 've looked the devil in the face and i 've seen god 's holy grace , through these eyes .
i 've tried to walk the straighter line .
i found myself again but nearly lost my mind .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on , yeah .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on .
