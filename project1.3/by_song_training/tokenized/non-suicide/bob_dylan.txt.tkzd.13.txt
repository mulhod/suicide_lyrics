#pledging my time

well , early in the morning till late at night i got a poison headache , but i feel alright .
i 'm pledging my time to you , hoping you 'll come through , too .
well , the hobo got to hide , but he came to me naturally .
he stole my baby and he wanted to steal me , but i 'm pledging my time to you , hoping you 'll come through , too .
wo n't you come with me , baby ?
i 'll take you where you want to go and , if it do n't work out , you 'll be the first to know .
i 'm pledging my time to you , hoping you 'll come through , too .
well , the room is so stuffy .
i can hardly breathe .
everybody 's gone but me and you and i ca n't be the last to leave .
i 'm pledging my time to you , hoping you 'll come through , too .
well , they sent for the ambulance and one was sent .
somebody got lucky , but it was an accident .
i 'm pledging my time to you , hoping you 'll come through , too .
