there 's guns across the river aiming at you , lawman on your trail , he 'd like to catch you , bounty hunters too , they 'd like to get you .
billy , they do n't like you to be so free .
camping out all night on the veranda , dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda , up to boot hill they 'd like to send you .
billy , do n't you turn your back on me .
playing around with some sweet seï¿½orita , into her dark hall where she will lead you , to the shadows of the mesa she will greet you .
billy , you 're so far away from home .
