# #Valerie Loves Me

Valerie 's dancing , in the room above my bed , you know , for all of the world below to see .
Valerie 's leaving , in a car outside my house , you know .
It 's such a shame she 's not with me .
And all the pretty things , and all the love my heart would bring .
I would give my whole life to her .
Valerie loves me .
Valerie 's riding , in a car around my neighboorhood .
She 's thinking of all the men she 'll meet .
I could only hope for a stolen moment of her thoughts between the walk to the club and all the drinks she 'll have in a crowded room where everybody leaves too soon .
I only hope that she remembers me .
Valerie loves me .
Valerie loves me .
Valerie 's lonely in an apartment down the street , you know , and her hair has turned so grey .
But she 's so happy , for the memories she has , you know .
She can believe in the day when love was on a string and she could have that anything she ever wanted , but she cant have me .
Valerie loves me .

# # Renee Remains the Same

Where is she going out tonight ?
Is she wearing your shirt ?
Is she driving your car ?
She was the one who was most likely to , but she never got through .
And she never got far .
And if we look at her yearbook picture , I 'm sure we 'll see a face that looks a lot like now .
She always wanted to be accepted .
She was only rejected , anyhow .
And Renee remains the same .
Renee , she 'll never change .
She 's the same .
Well , is she leaving the house tonight ?
Is she carrying your keys as she waves goodbye ?
He was the one who was most likely to , but he never got her through .
And they barely made it by , but if we look at her family picture , I 'm sure we 'll see a face that looks a lot like now .
I always wanted to get her attention .
I only got rejection , anyhow .
Renee remains the same .
Renee , she 'll never change .
She 's the same .
Is she taking your house tonight ?
Is she looking through your eyes as she says goodbye ?
You were the one that was gonna make her happy .
You only made her cry , but if you look at her yearbook picture , I 'm sure we 'll see a face that looks a lot like now .
I only wanted to get her affection .
I only got rejection , anyhow .
Renee remains the same .
Renee , she 'll never change .
She 's the same .
She 's the same .

# # International Pop Overthrow

I was riding around with the radio up and the windows down .
I took a minute or two to think about my problems .
Driving in this van .
Playing in this band .
You know it 's bringing me down , but I 'll pop back up when the pretty blue lights come on .
It 's an International Pop Overthrow , International Pop Overthrow .
It 's an International Pop Overthrow , International Pop Overthrow .
And all these other boys , they 're just making noise .
They do n't know rock and roll .
They just need someone to have their picture taken with , and I 've been thinking about you .
Tell me what do I do .
Come on where do I go ?
I do n't need a girlfriend .
I need an accomplice .
It 's an International Pop Overthrow , International Pop Overthrow .
It 's an International Pop Overthrow , International Pop Overthrow .
International pop , international pop , international pop , international pop .
It 's an International Pop Overthrow , International Pop Overthrow .
It 's an International Pop Overthrow , International Pop Overthrow , overthrow , overthrow , overthrow .

# #Very First Lie

I 'd like to wake up with you early in the morning , or stay up late , just playing records on your phonograph .
I 'd like to get to know your mother and your father .
Maybe just once , pretend to be somebody 's better half , and I would like to tell the very first lie .
I 'd like to ignore all my friends , and spend my time with you .
Maybe shake your tambourine .
I 'd like to do the sorts of things that you and I could do .
We could most anything .
And I would like to tell the very first lie .
I 'd like to get to know your family and friends you know .
Maybe pick you up from work .
I 'd like to do the sorts of things that you and I could do until it hurts .
I 'd like to wake up with you early in the morning , or stay up late , just playing records on your phonograph .
I 'd like to get to know your mother and your father .
Maybe just once , pretend to be somebody 's better half .
And I would like to tell the very first lie .

## Trouble

Let me tell you all a little story about the man who lives down at the top of the stairs .
Well he worked all his life for his children and his wife , and he opened up a little store down there .
One night , late while he was locking the gate , a kid came in and said : " You know what I want ? "
And he said : " I ai n't looking for trouble , and I know what you came here to do . "
" I ai n't looking for trouble . "
And the kid said : " Trouble 's come looking for you . "
Well I swore that I would find him .
I said that I would track him down .
And in a dirty darkened alleyway I said : " Today is your day . Whatever you do , do n't turn around . "
Well he looked up to me and said that I can see , that you know who I am and where I 've been .
And he said : " I ai n't looking for trouble , and I know what you came here to do . "
" I ai n't looking for trouble . "
And I said , " Trouble 's come looking for you . "
Well I 've spent four years of my life here , in this cold grey prison cell with my cigarettes and my magazine .
And my life , it feels like hell .
I hear footsteps in the hall , and I know they 're taking me away and all , and I said : " I do n't wanna die . "
and I said : " I ai n't looking for trouble , and I know what you came here to do . "
" I ai n't looking for trouble . "
And he said : " Trouble 's come looking for you . "

## This Far Before

I spend a lot of time thinking about you .
Do you think about me ?
I 'm trying real hard , you know , to live without you .
But girl ca n't you see , I 've been watchin , been waiting , been anticipating to come inside your heart .
And I 'm wishing , I 'm hoping , I 'm laughing , I 'm joking .
Is this the end or the start ?
Because I 've never fallen this far before .
No, I 've never fallen this far before .
My friends , they tell me that I 'm crazy for letting you go .
They just do n't really understand you .
They do n't know what I know .
Because I got so frustrated last time that we did it .
I just ca n't figure you out .
Now , I 'm laughing , I 'm crying , I 'm hoping , I 'm lying .
I 'm hoping to get it worked out .
Because I 've never fallen this far before .
No, I 've never fallen this far before .
Because I 've never fallen this far before .
No, I 've never fallen this far before .
I 'm trying real hard not to think about you , but are you thinking about me ?
I do n't know if I can live without you , but girl ca n't you see ?
Because I 'm watching , I 'm waiting , I 'm anticipating to come inside your heart .
You know I run right behind you , but still I ca n't find you .
I guess that we 're a step too far .
Because I 've never fallen this far before .
No, I 've never fallen this far before .
No, I 've never fallen this far before .
No, I 've never fallen this far before .

## Little Christine

Hello , well , it 's me again .
Like a leaf I fell from your tree again .
But if I look real hard , I can see again that you 'll never say you 're sorry .
I talked to him on your birthday .
He says you got a million lovers , and you said you really do n't need another to complicate your heart .
Well maybe I should n't have sent you flowers .
I should 've waited a couple of hours , but , hey , it was your birthday .
Little Christine , Little Christine .
And from across the yard , if I 'll move the trees , and I 'll kick away the stars , and I stay out all night , and I try a real hard , maybe I 'll find my way to your mind .
I talked to your very best friend .
She tells me you 're just a limping .
And then I 'll write this down if I only had a pen .
And I 'll skip the lonely path .
Well maybe I should n't have sent you flowers .
I should 've waited a couple of hours , but hey , it was your birthday .
Little Christine , little Christine .
Well maybe , I should n't have sent you flowers .
I should 've waited a couple of hours , but hey , it was your birthday .
Little Christine , little Christine .
Little Christine , little Christine .
