# #Strange Notes

Billy Druids face is marble .
He keeps every thought in it 's place .
He lets the days turn tomorrow .
Someone 's always walking on his grave .
He wears the lines just like Garbo , and talks at a saturmine pace .
Listening to the strange notes marvel .
Only giving what it takes .
It 's a sad man 's world , and for Billy it 's sure to crown .
Dragging beauty into darkness .
Inflicting a pale white frown .
And the matter that runs through Billy 's head is too concerned to fall .

## American Leather

Looking for a way out , I put my foot out of line .
Really like to break-out .
I feel so confined .
American leather , the poisonous members , not alone , not together .
Their American leather .
Saw you on a dark road .
Brought myself along .
Got a sense of conflict , but I know what 's wrong .
American leather , the poisonous members , not alone , not together .
Their American leather .
I know that kinda feeling .
So I built my place up high .
But you 'll never find me kneeling , cause I 'm too occupied .
American leather , the poisonous members , not alone , not together .
Their American leather .

## Lexicon Devil

I 'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain , and I 'm searchin' for a future .
The world 's my aim .
So give me , give me your hands .
Give me , give me your minds .
Give me , give me this .
Give me , give me that , yeah .
I want toy tin soldiers that can push and shove .
I want gunboy rovers that 'll wreck this club .
I 'll build you up and level your heads .
We 'll run it my way , cold men and politics dead .
I 'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain , and I 'm searchin' for a future .
The world 's my aim .
So give me , give me your hands .
Give me , give me your minds .
Give me , give me this .
Give me , give me that , yeah .
I 'll get silver guns to drip old blood .
Let 's give this established joke a shove .
We 're gonna wreak havoc on the rancid mill .
I 'm serachin' for something even if I 'm killed .
I 'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain , and I 'm searchin' for a future .
The world 's my aim .
So give me , give me your hands .
Give me , give me your minds .
Give me , give me this .
Give me , give me that , yeah .
Empty out your pockets .
You do n't need their change .
I 'm giving you the power to rearrange .
Together we 'll run to the highest prop .
Tear it down and let it drop away .
I 'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain , and I 'm searchin' for a future .
The world 's my aim .
So give me , give me your hands .
Give me , give me your minds .
Give me , give me this .
Give me , give me that , yeah .

# # Manimal

I came into this world a puzzled panther waiting to be caged , but something stood in the way .
I was never quite tamed .
Crossed the paths of right and wrong .
Saw them take their toll .
Saw armies that marched like animals they crawled .
I came into this world a puzzled panther waiting to be caged , but something stood in the way .
I was never quite tamed .
Evolution is a process too slow to save my soul , but I 've got this creature on my back .
It just wo n't let go .
If I am only an animal , then I can do no wrong .
Say something better , so I 've gotta hold on .

# # We Must Bleed

It 's Sunday and the streets are n't clear .
The traffic 's screaming , but we ca n't hear the sounds , the metals driving us mad .
The sounds , the metals , driving us mad .
We must bleed .
We must bleed .
We must bleed .
The crash as the bottle breaks , flashes it will through my veins .
The pain , the colors making me sane .
The pain , the colors making me sane .
The pain , the colors making me sane .
We must bleed .
We must bleed .
We must bleed .
I 'm not one I 'm two .
I 'm not one I 'm two .
I 'm not one I 'm two .
I want out now .
I want out now .
I want out now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now .

## Let 's Pretend

Out on the streets , what ya looking for ?
That thing in your bed 's just another whore .
That tear in your eyes , not a tear at all .
For that girl that you touch , you could never fall .
That stream in your mind it 's a tearing sty .
Let 's pretend you 're vicious .
Let 's pretend you 're cool .
Let 's pretend suspicious .
Let 's pretend you 're fools .
Your leather is tight but you wear it full .
' Gether is right but you gotta be cool .
You cut your wrists , but you do n't feel the pain .
You change your mind , but you still feel the same .
To dream ai n't your kind just another lie .
Let 's pretend you 're vicious .
Let 's pretend you 're cool .
Let 's pretend suspicious .
Let 's pretend you 're fools .
Sell us a story that we can believe .
Spend your dollars on pills for relief .
Love is a future that you still ca n't see .
Standing answers to questions are free .
Scream in your boredom life 's just to die .
Let 's pretend you 're vicious .
Let 's pretend you 're cool .
Let 's pretend suspicious .
Let 's pretend you 're fools .
Dive in problems just like stealing a fix .
Is your life to live or is it for kicks ?
Kick dirt in the faces of angry dream men .
Stand on your chairs and spell do n't let me in .
Do n't stand in the light because you know you ca n't cry .
Let 's pretend you 're vicious .
Let 's pretend you 're cool .
Let 's pretend suspicious .
Let 's pretend you 're fools .
Let 's pretend you 're vicious .
Let 's pretend you 're cool .
Let 's pretend suspicious .
Let 's pretend you 're fools .

## Land of Treason

Land of treason , waste no reason .
We are breathing fire .
We 're packs of dogs .
We 're enemies of men .
We are not desired .
Our faces show we 've grown so cold , but have not conspired .
Old hearts gone .
The future 's on .
Mother nations mired .
I like a recepticle for the chosen dead .
We find our bodies clawed .
And with the scent of death , we find that we are not so very awed .
Loyalties burned .
The words are blurred .
Overturn your own .
Walk like dogs and watch the doors .
Have your other stone .
Stop the toys that march disordered .
Calculate the thrones .
Feel the pulse descending , decaying hallowed tomes .
In the starving sense you worship the nations of debris .
You wear a coat of sewage that you 've never ever seen .
The time is now , the vicious here , a stolen dinner code .
The license of the savage land that you 've always sold .
So bite the hand that needs you and bless another coal .
The virus never issues from a cotton so very old .
As the lights come down , you wash your hands and start to climb the ladder that you stole .
Slip the hatch-and spin the sword .
The money lords are poor .
Push the tan that rolls downhill .
Their sense of dream absorbed .
Still the cat that breaks the night .
Tie him to the core .
Chase the viruses that believe that what 's right is scored .
It 's a senseless cash in of right for right .
What 's wrong is never gone , and left is just a bastion for the fools .
Golden dawn .
