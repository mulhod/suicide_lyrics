Guns in the Sky

See the sound .
It crashes in , all around .
It gets in .
Now take your hands and raise them up into the air that 's all around you .
Now bring them down like a clock at two .
Shake your head you know what to do .
They want to put guns in the sky .
Someone out there is n't going to like it , but it could be good .
Make us love each other .
Have to realize I own the future .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Child grows up to see guns in the sky .
Used to be on T.V.
Want to change .
Forgot the joke .
It 's great to see you .
I 'm running late .
Love your hair .
Lend me a ten .
Love your big house .
Could you spare a dime ?
Well I 'm sick of it .
It 's a load of shit .
We could stop the world and let of all the fools , and let them go , live with their guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .
Guns in the sky .

# Let Me Show You

This shattered town gets me down .
My ticket 's booked then you were found .
I tore them up like you tore my heart .
I 'm black and blue from love and art .
Give it up ; give me .
Who could take it ?
Give it up ; give me .
I guess I 'll shake it , but noone touches all you are .
Give it up .
Strip to show me all you are .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Yeah , but we’re gonna make you feel .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Well through the twilight how I 've tried to get my thoughts deep in your mind .
In my sleep I 've tasted you , intoxicated by your every move .
Give it up ; give me .
Who could take it ?
Give it up ; give me .
I guess I 'll shake it , but noone touches all you are .
Give it up .
Let me show you all you are .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
But we’re gonna make you feel .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Wow !
Because we’re gonna make you feel .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Ow !
I bet how you’re gonna make me feel .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Ow , hit me !
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Just how you help me feel .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Oh , put my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
Finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Let me show you how you make me feel .

# Fear

Tell me something .
I 've got to know .
All your troubles , I want to own .
I 'm not preaching because I 'm full of sin .
Nothing 's secret that I have not done .
Alone with your situation .
Fear on the face you 're saving .
Kiss the warm knives as they dig for your soul .
There in the corner of my dirty home .
Take the silver .
I 've paid that price .
Here 's the scandal .
They do n't let the truth get in the way .
Alone with your situation .
Fear on the face you 're saving .
Do n't you worry .
Do n't you run away .
There are some things that we know will never change .
Do n't you worry .
Do n't you look away .
There are some things that we know we 'll have to change .
Burning , teasing , searching , fever , twisting , turning , I 'm the white truth dealer .
Alone with your situation .
Fear on the face you 're saving .
