# Paranoid Android

Please , could you stop the noise .
I 'm trying to get some rest from all the unborn chicken voices in my head .
What 's that ?
I may be paranoid , but not an android .
What 's that ?
I may be paranoid , but not an android .
When I am king , you will be first against the wall , with your opinion which is of no consequence at all .
What 's that ?
I may be paranoid , but not an android .
What 's that ?
I may be paranoid , but not an android .
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly , kicking and squealing gucci little piggy .
You do n't remember .
You do n't remember .
Why do n't you remember my name ?
Off with his head , man .
Off with his head , man .
Why do n't you remember my name ?
I guess he does .
Rain down , rain down , come on , rain down on me from a great height , from a great height , height .
Rain down , rain down , come on , rain down on me from a great height , from a great height , height .
Rain down , rain down , come on , rain down on me .
That 's it , sir .
You 're leaving the crackle of pigskin , the dust and the screaming , the yuppies networking , the panic , the vomit , the panic , the vomit .
God loves his children .
God loves his children , yeah !

# Karma Police

Karma police , arrest this man .
He talks in maths .
He buzzes like a fridge .
He 's like a detuned radio .
Karma police , arrest this girl .
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill and we have crashed her party .
This is what you get .
This is what you get .
This is what you get when you mess with us .
Karma police , I 've given all I can .
It 's not enough .
I 've given all I can , but we 're still on the payroll .
This is what you get .
This is what you get .
This is what you get when you mess with us .
For a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself .
Phew , for a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself .
For a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself .
Phew , for a minute there , I lost myself , I lost myself .

# The Tourist

It barks at no one else but me like it 's seen a ghost .
I guess it seen the sparks flowing .
No one else would know .
Hey , man , slow down , slow down .
Idiot , slow down , slow down .
Sometimes I get overcharged .
That 's when you see sparks .
You ask me where the hell I 'm going at a thousand feet per second .
Hey , man , slow down , slow down .
Idiot , slow down , slow down .
Hey , man , slow down , slow down .
Idiot , slow down , slow down .

# The Bends

Where do we go from here ?
The words are coming out all weird .
Where are you now when I need you ?
Alone on an aeroplane .
Fall asleep against the windowpane .
My blood will thicken .
I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain because I 'd be scared that there 's nothing underneath .
But who are my real friends ?
Have they all got the bends ?
Am I really sinking this low ?
My baby 's got the bends , oh , no .
We do n't have any real friends , no , no , no .
Just lying in the bar with my drip-feed on , talking to my girlfriend , waiting for something to happen .
I wish it was the sixties .
I wish I could be happy .
I wish , I wish , I wish that something would happen .
Where do we go from here ?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear .
And where are you ?
They brought in the CIA , the tanks , and the whole marines to blow me away , to blow me sky-high .
My baby 's got the bends .
We do n't have any real friends .
Just lying in the bar with my drip-feed on , talking to my girlfriend , waiting for something to happen .
I wish it was the sixties .
I wish I could be happy .
I wish , I wish , I wish that something would happen .
I want to live , breathe .
I want to be part of the human race .
I want to live , breathe .
I want to be part of the human race , race , race , race .
Where do we go from here ?
The words are coming out all weird .
Where are you now when I need you ?

# Bones

I do n't want to be crippled , cracked , shoulders , wrists , knees , and back ground to dust and ash , crawling on all fours .
When you 've got to feel it in your bones .
When you 've got to feel it in your bones .
Now I ca n't climb the stairs , pieces missing everywhere , prozak painkillers .
When you 've got to feel it in your bones .
When you 've got to feel it in your bones .
And I used to fly like peter pan .
All the children flew when I touched their hands .
When you 've got to feel it in your bones .
When you 've got to feel it in your bones .

# Black Star

I get home from work and you 're still standing in your dressing gown .
Well , what am I to do ?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you .
What are we coming to ?
What are we gonna do ?
Blame it on the black star .
Blame it on the falling sky .
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home .
The troubled words of a troubled mind , I try to understand what is eating you .
I try to stay awake , but it 's fifty-eight hours since that I last slept with you .
What are we coming to ?
I just do n't know anymore .
Blame it on the black star .
Blame it on the falling sky .
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home .
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I do n't think of you .
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you .
What am I coming to ?
I 'm going to melt down .
Blame it on the black star .
Blame it on the falling sky .
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home .
This is killing me .
This is killing me .

# Down Is The New Up

Get yourself together .
Let the light pour in .
Pour yourself a hot bath .
pour yourself a drink .
Nothing 's going to happen without a warning .
Down is the new up .
What is up , buttercup ?
Down is the new up , is the new up .
Your services are not required .
Your future 's bleak .
you 're so last week .
Ladies and gentlemen , without a safety net , I shall now perform a one-eighty flip-flop , I shall now amputate , I shall now contort because down is the new up .
What if I just flip-flopped ?
Down is the new up , down is the new up , down is the new up , is the new up .
You 're on Candid Camera , the chink in your armor , topsy-turvy town , topsy-turvy town .
Shake your pockets out .
Pass it on , pass it down .
Topsy-turvy town , topsy-turvy town .

# Nude

Do n't get any big ideas .
They 're not going to happen .
You paint yourself white and fill up with noise , but there 'll be something missing .
Now that you 've found it , it 's gone .
Now that you feel it , you do n't .
You 've gone off the rails , do do n't get any big ideas .
They 're not going to happen .
You 'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking .

# Bangers and Mash

You bit me , bit me , bit me , oh .
You bit me , bit me , and i want more .
I 'm standing in the hall , kicking out the wall .
It 's all been said to comfort you .
Bangers in the mash , the negatives for cash .
You 're either in the club , baby , or you 're not .
Whatever turns you on , whatever gets you off .
Chief of police , the vice-chancellor , Lord and Lady Blah-Blah , the Vicar and the Judge .
You 're dancing to my little red book .
Bit me , bit me , bit me , oh .
I 've got the poison , poison , and I want more .
Get you an armored car .
They 're going to throw a rock .
Stare into the light .
The pyramid is power .
If you are on the top , then it is a long drop .
If you stare into the dark , the dark will stare back , back into your soul .
I want to thank you , thank you , thank you all .
I 'm having such a good time , a good time .
had enough ?
I 'm taking you down .
I 'm taking you down .
I 'm taking you down when I go down .
I 'm taking you down .
I 'm taking you down .
I 'm standing in the hall , kicking out the wall .
Bit me , bit me , bit me , oh .
Bit me , bit me , bit me , oh .
I 've got the poison .

# Go To Sleep

Something for the rag and bone man , over my dead body , something big is going to happen over my dead body .
Someone saw someone 's daughter over my dead body .
This is how I ended up sucked in over my dead body .
I 'm going to go to sleep and let this wash all over me .
We do n't really want a monster taking over , tiptoeing , tying down .
We do n't want the loonies taking over , tiptoeing , tying down our arms .
May pretty horses come to you as you sleep.
I 'm going to go to sleep and let this wash over me .

# A Wolf At The Door

Drag him out your window , dragging out your dead , singing I miss you .
Snakes and ladders .
Flip the lid .
Out pops the cracker , smacks you in the head , knifes you in the neck , kicks you in the teeth .
Steel-toe caps takes all your credit cards .
Get up , get the gunge , get the eggs , get the flan in the face , the flan in the face , the flan in the face .
Dance , you fucker .
dance , you fucker .
Do n't you dare .
Do n't you dare .
Do n't you flan in the face .
Take it with the love is given .
Take it with a pinch of salt .
Take it to the taxman .
Let me back .
let me back .
I promise to be good .
Do n't look in the mirror .
At the face you do n't recognize .
Help me call the doctor .
Put me inside .
Put me inside .
Put me inside .
Put me inside .
Put me inside .
I keep the wolf from the door , but he calls me up , calls me on the phone , tells me all the ways that he 's going to mess me up , steal all my children if I do n't pay the ransom .
But I 'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
Walking like giant cranes , ah , with my x-ray eyes i strip you naked in a tight little world and why are you on the list ?
Stepford wives , who are we to complain ?
Investments and dealers , investments and dealers .
cold wives and mistresses , cold wives and sunday papers .
City boys in first class do n't know we 're born little .
Someone else is going to come and clean it up , born and raised for the job .
Someone else always , does always pick it up .
Get over , get up , get over .
Turn the tape off .
I keep the wolf from the door , but he calls me up , calls me on the phone , tells me all the ways that he 's going to mess me up , steal all my children if I do n't pay the ransom .
But I 'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops , so I 'm just going to .

# Knives Out "

I want you to know he 's not coming back .
Look into my eyes .
I 'm not coming back .
So knives out , catch the mouse .
Do n't look down .
Shove it in your mouth .
If you 'd been a dog , they would 've drowned you at birth .
Look into my eyes .
It 's the only way you 'll know I 'm telling the truth .
So knives out , cook him up .
Squash his head , put him in the pot .
I want you to know he 's not coming back .
He 's bloated and frozen .
Still there 's no point in letting it go to waste .
So knives out , catch the mouse .
Squash his head , put him in the pot .

#Pyramid Song

I jumped in the river and what did I see ?
Black-eyed angels swam with me .
A moon full of stars and astral cars , all the things I used to see .
All my lovers were there with me , all my past and futures .
And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat .
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt .
I jumped into the river .

And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat .
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt .
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt .
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt .
