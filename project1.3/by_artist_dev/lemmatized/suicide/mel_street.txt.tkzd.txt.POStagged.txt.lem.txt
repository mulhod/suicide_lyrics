i always notice you two cadilacs and you twenty acre lawn and this big house of stone and marble look so empty and so alone . 
and the tear they blur me vision , as i picture you there with he , and i 'd rather drive a thousand mile around the town where you live . 
i remember when you say this a truck-driving man can n't give you the thing you desire , and you hand look well with diamond , and you 'd rather ride a chauffered drive car . 
well i guess this tonight you 've get all this thing , but be you miss the love i can give . 
if you be then darling be wait when i pass through the town where you live . 
if you 're lonely then darling be wait when i pass through the town where you live .
