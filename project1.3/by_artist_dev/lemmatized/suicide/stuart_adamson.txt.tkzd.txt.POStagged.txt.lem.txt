alone inside me head . 
alone inside me room . 
i feel alone inside me head , alone inside me tiny little world . 
it 's not me life in this old picture , the one you throw away . 
for i be always someone else and always far away . 
walk in the dark place where the mission meet , wait for the grind to open up beneath me foot . 
alone inside me head . 
alone inside me room . 
i feel alone inside me head alone inside me tiny little world . 
alone inside me head .

can use two step to cross a canyon , you 're beautiful people to me . 
if you do n't see the same tree i see , you 're beautiful people to me . 
make desert bloom and ocean die , just beautiful people i see . 
if you 're lose and dying of civilization , this 's enough for me . 
if you believe you own blind eye , you 're beautiful people to me . 
and you may miss what you never have and have what you do n't need . 
and the sun may set without you help , but you 're beautiful people to me . 
you may fall before you 're push , but it 's beautiful people i see .

# hold the heart sun beat hard on an empty beach where i try so hard , but can n't reach the star in you eye . 
you be just a child when i come to you , and we be friend 'till love step in , and you step away . 
i will lie and curse the day , and visit place where we lie alone , and find they turn to stone . 
because you hold the heart of someone new . 
i 'll take a chance on time . 
hold out here for something true , stand out of line . 
but i will wait a hundred year to hear you say me name the way you do before he come . 
the way you will again . 
i fall apart , and you come to me . 
i never can explain how much it turn me round , much more than upside down . 
' cause you hold the heart of someone new . 
i 'll take a chance on time . 
hold out here for something true , stand out of line . 
but i will wait a hundred year to hear you say me name the way you do before he come . 
the way you will again . 
and i love the sun . 
and i need the rain . 
and i know the way this you leave me be only to test me , and i be vain . 
and i will be strong . 
and i will be warm . 
and i will let no one come near me until you will hear me just once again . 
time will wear the mountain down , and make a lover of the clown who laugh too long , and color you wrong . 
now i hold the heart of someone new . 
i 'll take a chance on time . 
hold out here for something true , stand out of line . 
but i will wait a hundred year to hear you say me name the way you do before he come . 
the way you will again . 
but i will wait a hundred year to hear you say me name the way you do before he come . 
the way you will again . 
# you , me , and the truth there may be trouble ahead . 
there may be light in the distance . 
it may be something you say . 
maybe me lack of resistance . 
it take you so long to be young , and just a second to be old . 
leave me a moment in the sun . 
i 've get forever to be cold . 
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth . 
how do you learn to be kind ? 
where do you learn to be honest ? 
how do you learn to be blind ? 
why do you whisper the promise ? 
if you ca n't have what you want , why do n't you use what yov 've get ? 
i wo n't do thing this i ca n't . 
i ca n't be something this i 'm not . 
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth . 
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth . 
maybe we should just be friend . 
maybe we 'd be well stranger . 
i know this everything end . 
i know the color of danger . 
all we do be hide the fire . 
we just forget about the smoke . 
be this a smile with a future , or just a farewell to hope . 
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth . 
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth . 
but there 's me , and there 's you then there 's the truth .
