#Hometown Blues

Baby can't wait, baby got to go, got to do a number on a late-night show.
Do a little song, do a little dance, going to make the best of her big chance.
It don't really matter if she don't or if she do, just trying to make the best of the hometown blues.
I got a friend, got a little girl, says she's the best in the whole wide world.
Said it's so good, said it's unreal.
Might not last, but it's no big deal.
It don't really matter if she don't or if she do, just trying to make the best of the hometown blues.
Baby, save me, save me.
Save me with your sweet smile.
Honey, I really need you to help me kill a little bit of time.
All of the girls run with a crowd.
They go wild when the lights go down.
They got a little money, live in a dream, want to be the queen of their little scene.
It don't really matter if she don't or if she do.

#American Girl

Well, she was an American girl, raised on promises.
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else.
After all, it was a great big world with lots of places to run to and, if she had to die trying, she had one little promise she was going to keep.
Oh, yeah, alright, take it easy, baby.
Make it last all night.
She was an American girl.
Well, it was kind of cold that night.
She stood alone on her balcony.
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach and for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory.
God, it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach.
Oh, yeah, alright, take it easy, baby.
Make it last all night.
She was an American girl.

#Strangered in the Night

Well, it was dark at midnight.
There was hardly any moon and no one really saw much.
No one was really sure, but something didn't seem right.
Something seemed kind of queer.
The roar turned into whispers.
Everyone stood there when the sounds fit the night, like it hiding from the light, like strangers in the night, strangers in the night.
Well, I didn't see those shotguns and I didn't see no knife, but I saw this crazy black guy with a demon in his eyes and I heard him say, "White man, I've seen that silver cue.
You don't remember me well, but I remember you."
When the sounds fit the night, like it hiding from the light, like strangers in the night, strangers in the night.
Well, the knife just left his fingers as the black guy took his aim.
White guy's head exploded.
My God, how he pained!
And then everybody scattered.
I heard some woman scream, "Goddamn, you old black bastard!
Well, you've blown away my dreams!"
When the sound just fits the night, like it hiding from the light, like strangers in the night, strangers in the night, strangers in the night, strangers in the night.

#I Need to Know

Well, the talk on the street says you might go solo.
A good friend of mine saw you leaving by your back door.
I need to know.
I need to know.
If you think you're going to leave, then you better say so.
I need to know.
I need to know because I don't know how long I can hold on if you're making me wait, if you're leading me on.
I need to know.
Who would've thought that you'd fall for his line.
All of a sudden it's me on the outside.
I need to know.
I need to know.

#Listen to Her Heart

You think you're going to take her away with your money and your cocaine, keep thinking that her mind is going to change.
But I know everything is okay.
She's going to listen to her heart.
It's going to tell her what to do.
She might need a lot of loving, but she don't need you.
You want me to think that I'm being used.
You want her to think it's over.
Can't you see it don't matter what you do?
buddy, you don't even know her!
She's going to listen to her heart.
It's going to tell her what to do.
She might need a lot of loving, but she don't need you.
And you just can't creep up behind her and you can't understand that she's my girl, she's my girl.
She's going to listen to her heart.
It's going to tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving, but she don't need you.

#Don't Do Me Like That

I was talking with a friend of mine, said a woman had hurt his pride.
Told him that she loved him so and turned around and let him go.
Then he said, "You better watch your step or your going to get hurt yourself.
Someone's going to tell you lies, cut you down to size."
Don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
What if I love you, baby?
Don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
Someday I might need you, baby.
Don't do me like that.
Listen, honey, can you see?
Baby, you would bury me if you were in the public eye giving someone else a try.
And you know you better watch your step or you're going to get hurt yourself.
Someone's going to tell you lies, cut you down to size.
Don't do me like that.
Dont' do me like that.
What if I love you, baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
What if I need you, baby?
Don't do me like that because somewhere deep down inside someone is saying, "Love doesn't last that long."
I got this feeling inside night and day and now I can't take it no more.
Listen, honey, can you see?
Baby, you would bury me if you were in the public eye giving someone else a try.
And you know you better watch your step or you're going to get hurt yourself.
Someone's going to tell you lies, cut you down to size.
Don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
What if I love you, baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
I just might need you, honey.
Don't do me like that.
Wait!
Don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
Baby, baby, baby, don't, don't, don't, no!
Don't do me like that.
Don't do me like that.
Baby, baby, baby, oh, oh, oh!

#The Waiting

Oh, baby, don't it feel like heaven right now?
Don't it feel like something from a dream?
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this.
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again?
We know better than to try and pretend.
Baby, no one could've ever told me about this.
I said, yeah, yeah, the waiting is the hardest part.
Every day you see one more card.
You take it on faith.
you take it to the heart.
The waiting is the hardest part.
Well, yeah, I might have chased a couple women around.
All it ever got me was down.
Then there were those that made me feel good, but never as good as I'm feeling right now.
Baby, you're the only one that's ever known how to make me want to live like I want to live now.
I said, yeah, yeah, the waiting is the hardest part.
Every day you get one more yard.
You take it on faith.
you take it to the heart.
The waiting is the hardest part.
Oh, don't let it kill you, baby.
don't let it get to you.
Don't let it kill you, baby.
don't let it get to you.
I'll be your bleeding heart.
I'll be your crying fool.
Don't let this go too far.

#Change of Heart

Well, I fought for you.
I fought too hard to do it all again.
It's gone too far.
You never needed me.
you only wanted me around.
It gets me down.
There's been a change.
Yeah, there's been a change of heart.
I said, there's been a change.
You pushed just a little too far.
Made it just a little too hard.
There's been a change of heart.
I'll get over you.
it won't take long.
I've stood in your gallery.
I've seen what's hanging from the walls.
You were the moon and sun.
You're just a loaded gun now.
It gets me down.
There's been a change.
Yeah, there's been a change of heart.
I said, there's been a change.
You pushed just a little too far.
Made it just a little too hard.
There's been a change of heart.
Oh, yeah, oh, boy, looks like we finally hit the turning point.
Oh me, oh my, looks like it's time for me to kiss it goodbye.

#Straight into Darkness

There was a little girl.
I used to know her.
I still think about her, time to time.
There was a moment when I really loved her.
Then, one day the feeling just died.
We went straight into darkness, out over the line, yeah, straight into darkness, straight into night.
I remember flying out to London.
I remember the feeling at the time..
out the window of the 747, man, there was nothing, only black sky
We went straight into darkness, out over the line, straight into darkness, straight into night.
Oh, give it up to me.
I need it.
Girl, I know when I see it.
Baby, wrong or right, I need it.
I don't believe the good times are over.
I don't believe the thrill is all gone.
Real love is a man's salvation.
The weak ones fall.
the strong carry on, straight into darkness, out over the line, yeah, straight into darkness, straight into night.

#Rebels

Honey, don't walk out.
I'm too drunk to follow.
You know you won't feel this way tomorrow.
Well, maybe a little rough around the edges or inside a little hollow.
I get faced with some things sometimes that are so hard to swallow, hey!
I was born a rebel, down in Dixie, on a Sunday morning.
yeah, with one foot in the grave and one foot on the pedal, I was born a rebel.
She picked me up in the morning and she paid all my tickets.
Then, she screamed in the car, left me out in the thicket.
Well, I never would've dreamed that her heart was so wicked, yeah, but I keep coming back because it's so hard to kick it, hey, hey, hey.
I was born a rebel, down in Dixie, on a Sunday morning.
yeah, with one foot in the grave and one foot on the pedal, I was born a rebel.
Even before my father's father they called us all rebels while they burned our cornfields and left our cities leveled.
I can still feel the eyes of those blue-bellied devils, yeah, when I'm walking around at night through the concrete and metal, hey, hey, hey.

#Learning to Fly

Well, I started out down a dirty road, started out all alone and the sun went down as I crossed the hill and the town lit up, the world got still.
I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings.
Coming down is the hardest thing.
Well, the good old days may not return and the rocks might melt and the sea may burn.
I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings.
Coming down is the hardest thing.
Well, some say life will beat you down, break your heart, steal your crown, so I've started out for God knows where.
I guess I'll know when I get there.
I'm learning to fly around the clouds, but what goes up must come down.
I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings.
Coming down is the hardest thing.

#Walls (Circus)

Some days are diamonds.
Some days are rocks.
Some doors are open.
Some roads are blocked.
Sundowns are golden, then fade away, but, if I never do nothing, I'll get you back some day because you got a heart so big it could crush this town and I can't hold out forever.
Even walls fall down.
All around your island there's a barricade that keeps out the danger, that holds in the pain.
Sometimes you're happy.
Sometimes you cry.
Half of me is ocean.
Half of me is sky.
but you got a heart so big it could crush this town and I can't hold out forever.
Even walls fall down.
Some things are over.
Some things go on.
Part of me you carry.
Part of me is gone.
but you got a heart so big it could crush this town and I can't hold out forever.
Even walls fall down.
You got a heart so big it could crush this town and I can't hold out forever.
Even walls fall down.

#Lonesome Sundowns

She's a lonely girl lost in the world.
Got love in her eyes for me.
She's a sweet young thing, brings me dreams in a box she made for me.
Lonesome sundown, yeah, this is going to be hard.
It's a lonesome sundown, yeah, this is going to be hard.
I know, so don't let go.
This is going to be hard.
I'll never let you down.
This love I've found, it means too much to me and I stand accused outside the law, but you are all I need.
Lonesome sundown, yeah, this is going to be hard.
It's a lonesome sundown, yeah, this is going to be hard.
I know, so don't let go.
This is going to be hard.
Redemption comes to those who wait.
Forgiveness is the key and I wish you love and I wish you hope.
Please believe in me.
And it's a lonesome sundown, yeah, this is going to be hard.
Yeah, a lonesome sundown, yeah, this is going to be hard.
I know, so don't let go.
This is going to be hard.

#The Last DJ

Well, you can't turn him into a company man, you can't turn him into a whore, and the boys upstairs just don't understand anymore.
well, the top brass don't like him talking so much and he won't play what they say to play and he don't want to change what don't need to change.
And there goes the last DJ who plays what he wants to play and says what he wants to say, hey, hey, hey.
and there goes your freedom of choice, there goes the last human voice, and there goes the last DJ.
and some folks say they're gonna hang him so high because you just can't do what he did, theres some things you just can't put in the minds of those kids.
as we celebrate mediocrity, all the boys upstairs want to see how much you'll pay for what you used to get for free.
And there goes the last DJ who plays what he wants to play and says what he wants to say, hey, hey, hey.
and there goes your freedom of choice, there goes the last human voice, and there goes the last DJ.
well, he got a new station down in mexico and sometimes it will kind of come in and I'll bust a move and remeber how it was back thenAnd there goes the last DJ who plays what he wants to play and says what he wants to say, hey, hey, hey.
and there goes your freedom of choice, there goes the last human voice, and there goes the last DJ, back to top

#Money Becomes King

If you reach back in your memory, a little bell might ring about a time that once existed when money wasn't king.
If you stretch your imagination, I'll tell you all a tale about a time when everything wasn't up for sale.
There was this cat named Johnny who loved to play and sing, when money wasn't king.
We'd all get so excited when John would give a show.
We'd raise the cash between us and down the road we'd go to hear him play that music.
It spoke right to my soul, every verse a diamond and every chorus gold.
The sound was my salvation.
It was only everything before money became king.
Well, I ain't sure how it happened and I don't know exactly when, but everything got bigger and the rules began to bend and the TV taught the people how to get their hair to shine and how sweet life can be, if you keep a tight behind.
And they raised the cost of living and how could we have known they'd double the price of tickets to go see Johnny's show?
So we hocked all our possessions and we sold a little dope and went off to rock-n-roll.
We arrived there early, in time to see rehearsal, and John came out and lip-synched his new lite-beer commercial.
And, as the crowd arrived as far as I could see, the faces were all different.
There was no one there like me.
They sat in golden circles and waiters served them wine and talked through all the music and to John paid little mind.
And way up in the nosebleeds we watched upon the screen they hung between the billboards, so cheaper seats could see.
Johnny, rock that golden circle and all those VIPs and that music that had freed us became a tired routine.
And I saw his face in close-up trying to give it all he had and sometimes his eyes betrayed him.
You could see that he was sad.
And I tried to rock on with him, but I slowly became bored.
Could that man on stage with everything somehow need some more?
There was no use in pretending, no magic left to hear.
All the music gave me was a craving for lite-beer.
As I walked out of the arena, my ears began to ring and money became king.

#Dreamville

Going down to Lillian's music store to buy a black-diamond string.
Going to wind it up on my guitar.
Going to make that silver sing like it was Dreamville.
A long time ago, a million miles away, all the trees were green in Dreamville.
I keep waking up all by myself with a bluejay in my brain, flapping his wings, making me sing.
It was just about to rain like it was Dreamville, where I was born, light-years from here, and the air smelled good in Dreamville.
Like it was Dreamville, a long time ago, light-years from her, and the trees were green in Dreamville.
Riding with my mama to Glen Springs Pool, the water was cold, my lips were blue, there was rock-n-roll across the dial.
When I think of her, it makes me smile like it was Dreamville.
a long time ago, a million miles away, all the trees were green in Dreamville, in Dreamville.
Yeah, it was Dreamville, a long time ago, light-years from here, and the air smelled good in Dreamville, in Dreamville

#Joe

My name's Joe.
I'm the CEO.
Yeah, I'm the man makes the big wheels roll.
I'm the hand on the green-light switch.
You get to be famous, I get to be rich.
Go get me a kid with a good-looking face, bring me a kid can remember his place, some hungry poet son-of-a-bitch.
He gets to be famous, I get to be rich.
Or bring me a girl.
They're always the best.
You put them on stage and you have them undress.
Some angel whore who can learn a guitar lick.
Hey, now that's what I call music!
Well, they'll come looking for money when the public gets bored, but we'll fight them with lawyers they could never afford.
Yeah, I'll make her look like a spoiled little bitch.
She gets to be famous, I get to be rich.
Or bring me a girl.
They're always the best.
You put them on stage and you have them undress.
Some angel whore who can learn a guitar lick.
Hey, now that's what I call music!
So burned-out Johnny thinks the books are shifty.
What good's that alchy to me when he's fifty?
Well, we could move catalog if he'd only die quicker!
Send my regards to the gig and a case of good liquor.
He gets to be famous, I get to be rich.
He gets to be famous, I get to be rich.
My name's Joe.
I'm the CEO.
I'm the man makes the big wheels roll.

#When a Kid Goes Bad

You got a different kind of look in your eye, something about you that I don't recognize.
These things are talked about in quiet tones.
I never saw a person so all alone.
Some mama's crying, some daddy's sad when a kid goes bad.
Makes you wonder what made him mad when a kid goes bad, when a kid goes bad.
You built for innocence, you built for joy.
Suddenly evil's all that you enjoy, but, if you shoot at everyone you see, well, you can't be my friend because you might shoot at me.
Some mama's crying, some daddy's sad when a kid goes bad.
Makes you wonder what made him mad when a kid goes bad, when a kid goes bad.
Somewhere along the way, did we let you down?
Did you cry out for help and none was around?
Don't try to tell me that you don't know the score.
Are you so shut down you can't feel anymore?
Some mama's crying, some daddy's sad when a kid goes bad.
Makes you wonder what made him mad when a kid goes bad, when a kid goes bad.

#Like a Diamond

Madmen crawl across the wall.
Knight gets away.
Kings all fall and queens chase men and saints all sin and good things all must end.
But she goes on forever.
She goes on forever.
Yeah, she's going to shine forever, like a diamond iIn the sunlight.
Big full moon above the road.
I'm a long, long way from tomorrow.
Got to light my way down this highway to get to her because she goes on forever.
She goes on forever.
Yeah, she's going to shine forever, like a diamond iIn the sunlight.
Deacons steal and Ma can't feel.
If you're lonely and behind the wheel when the ground gives way, you have to pray to the unknown and hope it's real.
But she goes on forever.
She goes on forever.
She's going to shine forever.
She goes on forever.
She goes on forever.
Yeah, she's going to shine forever, like a diamond iIn the sunlight.

#Lost Children

Lord, please watch over all these lost children, born to chase the hurricane.
Please shine some light down on those who wander, filled with hunger and pain.
Please raise the wind for all those out sailing on an ocean alone.
Lord, shine a light on all these lost children, far away from their home.
Lord, keep an eye on all these lost children, swept away in the wind.
Please shine some light down on all those traveling.
Lead them all home again.

#You and Me

Take a look at what I got.
I can't promise you a lot, but you and me and the road ahead.
I can't change you from yourself.
You got to want it.
all that's left is you and me and the road ahead.
Wherever that wind might blow, wherever that river rolls, you know I will go with you.
Looking over the mountain's crown, the water roars and tumbles down, like you and me and the road ahead.
Wherever that wind might blow, wherever that river rolls, you know I will go with you, just you and me and the road ahead, just you and me and the road ahead.

#The Man Who Loves Women

He's the man who loves women, wWomen, women, women.
He's the man who loves women and falling in love every day.
When he sees a senorita, it's a sure thing that he'll heed her.
He's the man who loves women and falling in love every day.
But in the morning, when she wakes up, he'll be far away, keeping his secrets safe, hey, hey, hey, hey.
But in the morning, when she wakes up, he'll be far away, keeping his secrets safe, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Ah, ah, ah, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, I love you.

Oh, stay away, he's the man who loves women.

#Have Love Will Travel

You never had a chance, did you, baby, so good-looking, so insecure?
And now you say you can't remember when the lines you drew began to blur.
Yeah, when all of this is over, should I lose you in the smoke, I want you to know you were the one and may my love travel with you everywhere, yeah, may my love travel with you always.
Maggie's still trying to rope a tornado, Joe's in the backyard trying to keep things simple, and the lonely dj's digging a ditch, trying to keep the flames from the temple.
Oh, and, if perhaps I lose you in the smoke down the road, I want you to know you were the one and may my love travel with you everywhere, yeah, may my love travel with you always.
How about a cheer for all those bad girls and all the boys that play that rock-n-roll?
They love it like you love Jesus.
It does the same thing to their souls
And when all of this is over, should I lose you in the smoke, I want you to know that it's alright and may my love travel with you everywhere, yeah, may my love travel with you always.

#Free Falling

She's a good girl, loves her mama, loves Jesus and America, too.
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis, loves horses and her boyfriend, too.
It's a long day living in Reseda, there's a freeway running through the yard, and I'm a bad boy because I don't even miss her, I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart, and I'm free, I'm free-falling.
All the vampires walking through the valley move west down Ventura Boulevard and all the bad boys are standing in the shadows, all the good girls are home with broken hearts, and I'm free, I'm free-falling.
I want to glide down over Mulholland.
I want to write her name in the sky.
I want to free-fall out into nothing.
Going to leave this world for a while and I'm free, I'm free-falling.

#You Don't Know How It Feels

Let me run with you tonight.
I'll take you on a moonlight ride.
There's someone I used to see, but she don't give a damn for me.
But let me get to the point.
let's roll another joint and turn the radio loud.
I'm too alone to be proud.
You don't know how it feels.
You don't know how it feels to be me.
People come, people go.
Some grow young, some grow cold.
I woke up in between a memory and a dream, so let's get to the point.
let's roll another joint.
let's head on down the road.
There's somewhere I got to go.
And you don't know how it feels.
You don't know how it feels to be me.
My old man was born to rock.
He's still trying to beat the clock.
Think of me what you will.
I've got a little space to fill, so let's get to the point.
let's roll another joint and let's head on down the road.
There's somewhere I got to go.
And you don't know how it feels.
No, you don't know how it feels to be me.
