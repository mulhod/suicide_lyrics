#dumb

i 'm not like them , but i can pretend .
the sun is gone , but i have a light .
the day is done , but i 'm having fun .
i think i 'm dumb or maybe just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy .
my heart is broke , but i have some glue .
help me inhale and mend it with you .
we 'll float around and hang out on clouds .
then we 'll come down and have a hangover , have a hangover , have a hangover , have a hangover .
skin the sun .
fall asleep.
wish away .
the soul is cheap .
lesson learned .
wish me luck .
soothe the burn .
wake me up .
i 'm not like them , but i can pretend .
the sun is gone , but i have a light .
my day is done , but i 'm having fun .
i think i 'm dumb , maybe just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
i think i 'm dumb .
