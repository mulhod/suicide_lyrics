# where the rose is sown

we 're at war all the papers say .
we will win , i read today .
we are strong .
it was n't us .
we are right .
who started this ?
leave your work .
i just left school .
leave your home .
i am no fool .
take up arms .
it left me strong .
sound alarms , the school bell rings .
sons of men , who stand like gods .
we give life to feed the cause , and run to ground our heathen foe .
our name will never die .
this time will be forever .
join up here .
i wave goodbye .
we need you , oh my breast sighs .
have no fear .
now i must try .
god will be with braver men .
take the vow .
i know it 's right .
praise the flag , the good fight .
we 're at war .
i 'm on my way .
we will win .
why do i pray ?
sons of men who stand like gods .
we give life to feed the cause , and run to ground our heathen foe .
our name will never die .
this time will be forever .
i wait here in this hole playing poker with my soul .
i hold the rifle close to me .
it lights the way to keep me free .
if i die in a combat zone , box me up and ship me home .
if i die and still come home , lay me where the rose is sown .
sons of men who stand like gods .
we give life to feed the cause .
and run to ground our heathen foe .
our name will never die .
this time will be forever .
