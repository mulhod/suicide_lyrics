#save me

no turning back .
no looking around .
i was n't searching .
see , what i found inside the spaces inside of me .
if there 's a reason , what will it be ?
come on and save me .
come on and save me .
i want to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
go on and change me .
hey , rearrange me .
i need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
i thought i knew .
i had my hope .
swing in the changes , ring out the old .
i 'm happy chasing what i ca n't reach .
i 'm still embracing secrets i meet .
come on and save me .
come on and save me .
i want to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
go on and change me .
hey , rearrange me .
i need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
i wasted time .
but that was n't mine .
i hung the jury .
i fled the crime .
shake off tomorrow .
break off the past .
i know that sorrow .
it never lasts .
come on and save me .
come on and save me .
i need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
go on and change me .
hey , rearrange me .
i need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
come on and save me .
come on and save me .
i want to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
go on and change me .
hey , rearrange me .
i need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
