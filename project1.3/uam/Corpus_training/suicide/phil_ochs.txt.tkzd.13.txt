#city boy

i 'm just a city boy , born and bred .
it 's a city life i 've led .
my pasture was a street .
i 've never climbed a tree , but that 's alright with me because i 'm a city boy .
i 'm just a city boy , born and raised .
from these rooftops i have gazed , where the grass was made of steel .
i 've never plowed a field .
until the pavement starts to peel , i 'll be a city boy .
i 'm just a city boy , born and grown .
that 's all i 've ever known .
where the lights would greet the dawn , there 's a factory for a farm .
sure , the city has its charm when you 're a city boy .
