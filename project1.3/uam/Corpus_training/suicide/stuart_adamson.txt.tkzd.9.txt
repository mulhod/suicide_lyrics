#king of emotion

one , two , one , two , three , four .
i know where all that time has gone , blown and drifted , listening to an august night .
i see where i was wrong .
how could i know that you were right when you said i would need something wild , something crazy to carry me .
i would see you naked and weary , but with pride in your eyes that put shame in me .
i wait to find the things i need but i know i want that love , king of emotion .
stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
say , na na , na na , du , di di na na , na na na , du du .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
you know where all that time was gone , grown up and left , washed out like an april day .
see all those pretty little things you knew .
worn and faded , they lie cast away because you said , you would need something wild , something special to carry you .
you would see me naked and weary , but with pride in my eyes that put shame in you .
until you find the things you need i know , i want , i want that love , king of emotion .
stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
say , na na , na na , du , di di , na na , na na na , du du .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
until we find the things we need , i know i want that love , king of emotion .
stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
i want that love , king of emotion .
stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
say , na na , na na , du , di di , na na , na na na , du du .
i know that love is king of emotion .
i want that love , king of emotion .
stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
i know that love is king of emotion .
king of emotion take a walk with me .
say , na na , na na , du , di di , na na , na na na , du du .
i know that love is king of emotion .
