#a.m.a . song

we are the nation 's physicians .
yes , we give to our lobbies every day .
we will fight against disease when the money comes with ease and , when we get together , we say , "hooray for a.m.a . and for us doctors , gluts of higher pay .
if you ca n't afford my bill , do n't you tell me that you 're ill because that 's the free enterprise way .
we 've divided up the sections of the body .
every day we specialize more and more .
but we really love to stitch the diseases of the rich .
we are sure there is a clinic for the poor .
hooray for the a.m.a and for us doctors , gluts of higher pay .
if you ca n't afford my bill , do n't you tell me that you 're ill because that 's the free enterprise way and our waiting rooms are getting pretty crowded .
it is sad to see our patients sit and bleed , but , if you must use our ointment , then you must have an appointment or who 'll pay for those magazines you read ?
hooray for the a.m.a and for us doctors , gluts of higher pay , higher pay .
if you ca n't afford my bill , do n't you tell me that you 're ill because that 's the free enterprise way and now the government is getting too ambitious .
yes , we know they want to socialize us all .
well , our oath was hippocratic , but with money we 're fanatic , so we 'll see you in canada in the fall .
hooray for the a.m.a . and for us doctors , gluts of higher pay .
if you ca n't afford my bill , do n't you tell me that you 're ill because that 's the free enterprise way .
amalgamated a.m.a .
