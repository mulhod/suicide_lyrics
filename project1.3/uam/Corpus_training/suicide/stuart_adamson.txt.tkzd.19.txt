#you , me , and the truth

there may be trouble ahead .
there may be light in the distance .
it may be something you said .
maybe my lack of resistance .
it took you so long to be young , and just a second to be old .
leave me a moment in the sun .
i 've got forever to be cold .
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
how did you learn to be kind ?
where did you learn to be honest ?
how do you learn to be blind ?
why do you whisper the promise ?
if you ca n't have what you want , why do n't you use what yov 've got ?
i wo n't do things that i ca n't .
i ca n't be something that i 'm not .
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
maybe we should just be friends .
maybe we 'd be better strangers .
i know that everything ends .
i know the color of danger .
all we do is hide the fire .
we just forget about the smoke .
is that a smile with a future , or just a farewell to hope .
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
but there 's me , and there 's you then there 's the truth .
