#talking vietnam

sailing over to vietnam , southeast asian birmingham .
well , training is the word we use .
nice word to have in case we lose .
training a million vietnamese to fight for the wrong government and the american way .
well , they put me in a barracks house just across the way from laos .
they said you 're pretty safe when the troops deploy , but do n't turn your back on your house , boy .
when they ring the gong , watch out for the viet-cong .
well , the sergeant said it 's time to train , so i climbed aboard my helicopter plane .
we flew above the battle-ground .
a sniper tried to shoot us down .
he must have forgotten we 're only trainees .
them commies never fight fair .
friends , the very next day we trained some more .
we burned some villages down to the floor .
yes , we burned out the jungles far and wide .
made sure those red apes had no place left to hide .
threw all the people in relocation camps under lock and key .
made damn sure they 're free .
well , i walked through the jungle and around the bend .
who should i meet but president diem .
said you 're fighting to keep vietnam free for good old diem-ocracy .
that means rule by one family and 15,000 american troops , give or take a few .
thousand american troops .
