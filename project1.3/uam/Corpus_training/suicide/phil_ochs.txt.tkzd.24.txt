#ballad of william worthy

well , it 's of a bold reporter whose story i will tell .
he went down to the cuban land , the nearest place to hell .
he 'd been there many times before , but now the law does say the only way to cuba is with the c.i .a .
william worthy is n't worthy to enter our door .
went down to cuba .
he 's not american anymore .
but somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world .
in the free world you must stay .
five thousand dollars or a five year sentence may well be for a man who had the nerve to think that traveling is free .
oh , why 'd he waste his time to see a dictator 's reign when he could have seen democracy by traveling on to spain ?
william worthy is n't worthy to enter our door .
went down to cuba .
he 's not american anymore .
but somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world .
in the free world you must stay .
so , come all you good travelers and fellow travelers too , yes , and travel all around the world , see every country through .
i 'd surely like to come along and see what may be new , but my passport 's disappearing as i sing these words to you .
well , there really is no need to travel to these evil lands .
yes , and , though the list grows larger , you must try to understand .
try hard not to worry if someday you should hear the whole world is off limits .
visit disneyland this year .
william worthy is n't worthy to enter our door .
went down to cuba .
he 's not american anymore .
but somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world .
in the free world you must stay .
