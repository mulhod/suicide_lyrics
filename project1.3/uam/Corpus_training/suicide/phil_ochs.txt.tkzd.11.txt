# a toast to those who are gone

many 's the hour i 've lain by my window and thought of the people who carried the burden , who marched in the strange fields in search of an answer and ended their journeys an unwilling hero .
here 's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die .
back in the coal fields of old harlan county , some talked of the union , some talked of good wages and they lined them up in the dark of the forests and shot them down without asking no questions .
here 's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die .
and over the ocean to the red spanish soil came the lincoln brigade with their dreams , but they fell in the fire of germany 's bombing and they fell because no one would hear their sad warning .
here 's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die .
in old alabama , in old mississippi , two states of the union so often found guilty , they came on the buses , they came on the marches , and they lay in the jails or they fell by the highway .
here 's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die .
the state , it was texas , the town , it was dallas , in the flash of a rifle a life was soon over and nobody thought of the past million murders and the long list of irony had found a new champion .
here 's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die .
