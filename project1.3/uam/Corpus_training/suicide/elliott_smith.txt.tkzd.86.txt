#sweet adeline

cut this picture into you and me .
burn it backwards .
kill this history .
make it over .
make it stay away or hate 'll say the ending that love started to stay .
there 's a kid a floor below me saying , brother , can you spare sunshine for a brother ?
old man winter 's in the air .
walked me up a story , asking how you are .
told me not to worry , you were just a shooting star .
sweet adeline , sweet adeline , my clementine , sweet adeline .
it 's a picture-perfect evening and i 'm staring down the sun , fully loaded , deaf and dumb and done , waiting for sedation to disconnect my head or any situation where i 'm better off than dead .
