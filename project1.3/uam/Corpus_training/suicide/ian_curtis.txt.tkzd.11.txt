walk in silence .
do n't walk away in silence .
see the danger , always danger .
endless talking .
life rebuilding .
do n't walk away .
walk in silence .
do n't turn away in silence .
your confusion , my illusion , worn like a mask of self-hate , confronts and then dies .
do n't walk away .
people like you find it easy , naked to see .
walking on air .
hunting by the rivers , through the streets .
every corner abandoned too soon , set down with due care .
do n't walk away in silence .
do n't walk away .
