#boy in ohio

creek was running by the road and the buckeye sun was shining .
i rode my bike down alum creek drive when i was a boy in ohio .
the english teacher , he did n't care .
he challenged us to checkers and once in a while we 'd swap a joke .
when i was a boy in ohio , once i was caught playing hooky from school .
they found me home in the evening .
i confessed i had been to the movie show when i was a boy in ohio .
we would wait for the summer to come , for swimming and picking berries , but now a freeway covers the field where i used to be so happy .
i remember the burger boy , where the girls would shine like the engines and the radio was always loud when i was a boy in ohio .
spanish teacher , she tried to help .
she was much too pretty , so i just stared at the back of her legs when i was a boy in ohio .
it was beer at the honkytonk bar where they said the girls were easy , but somehow i never found me one when i was a boy in ohio .
soon i was grown and i had to leave and i 've been all over the country , but i do n't believe i 've had more fun than when i was a boy in ohio .
