#paul crump

in the state of illinois about nine years ago a cold-blooded killer , he went against the law .
he killed a factory guard when his robbery did fail and they caught him and they threw him into jail .
he lay there in his cell , locked up with his hate .
not many men knew of him and less cared for his fate .
and he knew no peace of mind when his trial was coming by .
the judge said , "you are guilty you must die" .
but paul crump is alive today .
he 's sitting in a cell .
he 's got something to say .
every man has got something to give and , if a man can change , then a man should live .
they sent him to cook county jail , a jail known far and wide , where pity was a stranger and brave men often cry .
they locked him in the death-row to count the days before to the day they came knocking at his door .
but another warden came along .
jack johnson was his name .
he knew how prison living could drive a man to shame .
he had no need of pistols in a solitary cell when a word of trust would help him just as well .
now paul crump is alive today .
he 's sitting in a cell .
he 's got something to say .
every man has got something to give and , if a man can change , then a man should live .
between the warden and the convict , a friendship slowly grew and one learned from the other that a man can live anew .
then the warden called the convict , "you must leave the devil 's plan .
the time has come for you to be a man " .
then the convict found religion and he started him to learn .
he wrote himself a novel called 'burn , killer , burn ' and , as his dying day grew near , to the warden he did cry , "you must pull the switch and i must die" .
now paul crump is alive today .
he 's sitting in a cell .
he 's got something to say .
every man has got something to give and , if a man can change , then a man should live .
it was up to governor kerner to keep him from the grave .
was rehabilitation a reason to be saved ?
the hour was coming closer .
the word was spread around .
a new and better answer must be found .
well , the electric chair was cheated .
the convict did n't pay .
a new concept of justice was born and raised that day .
now throughout this peaceful land there are others set to die .
what better time than now to question why ?
now paul crump is alive today .
he 's sitting in a cell .
he 's got something to say .
every man has got something to give and , if a man can change , then a man should live .
