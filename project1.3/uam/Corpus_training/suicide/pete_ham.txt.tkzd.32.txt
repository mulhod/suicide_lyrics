#know one knows

no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when i see you glow .
no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when you let it show .
keep it coming .
keep it long .
caress me with your body song .
reach it higher with each sigh , knowing soon that we will fly .
no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when i see you glow .
no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when you let it flow .
keep it moving .
keep it bright and guide me with your body light .
come in closer with each sigh , knowing soon that we will fly .
no one knows .
no one knows .
no one knows .
no one knows how good i feel when you let it show .
no one knows .
no one knows how good i feel when you let it flow .
keep on feeling .
keep it whole and lead me with your body soul .
take me higher with each sigh , knowing you can make me fly .
no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when i see you glow .
