#beautiful people
if beauty is an ecstasy , and anger keeps you poor , a hungry man is never free , a rich man never cured .
things were never what they used to be .
now every crowd has its silver lining ; we all got stuff to sell .
and you may live your life so bitter , but you remember it so well .
things were never what they used to be for all the folks who can run the world , drive cabs , or cut your hair .
and the sun may set without your help , but you 're beautiful people to me .
you may fall before you 're pushed , but it 's beautiful people i see .
if you only see the stars when it 's dark , that 's enough for me .
an empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me .
it 's all the same in different hats , the proof of the missing link , a nation talking to itself and none of us can think .
things were never what they used to be .
for a silent fool may still be wise , there 's no way you can tell .
and the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me .
and the finest government you could buy , it 's beautiful people i see .
if you live five to one against , it 's good enough for me .
ca n't use two steps to cross a canyon , you 're beautiful people to me .
if you do n't see the same trees i see , you 're beautiful people to me .
make deserts bloom and oceans die , just beautiful people i see .
if you 're lost and dying of civilization , that 's enough for me .
if you believe your own blind eye , you 're beautiful people to me .
and you may miss what you never had and have what you do n't need .
and the sun may set without your help , but you 're beautiful people to me .
you may fall before you 're pushed , but it 's beautiful people i see .
if you only see the stars when it 's dark , that 's enough for me .
an empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me .
and the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me .
and the finest government you could buy , it 's beautiful people i see .
if you live five to one against , it 's good enough for me .
ca n't use two steps to cross a canyon , you 're beautiful people to me .
if you do n't see the same trees i see , you 're beautiful people to me .
make deserts bloom and oceans die , just beautiful people i see .
if you 're lost and dying of civilization , that 's enough for me .
if you believe your own blind eye , you 're beautiful people to me .
