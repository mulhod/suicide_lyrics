#comes a time

it 's a holy place if you see things that way , then they rattle the bones and the analysts play .
from his backward collar on a worn out book another working class poet with an abstract look .
so take me up to the edge of the world and push me over again .
lead me up to the edge of the world .
there comes a time .
now , shake your hair and rattle your cans , it 's a service funded by a self-made man .
he alks to victims and industrial spies .
he feeds you tobacco for the four-minute mile .
so take me up to the edge of the world and push me over again .
lead me up to the edge of the world .
there comes a time .
with some strange god and a good right hand we can chase the ghost from the promised land .
if the promised land turns out as it should we can flood the place with consumer goods .
when the african general meets the bingo queen and the collective farmer joins the teenage dream , when the miracle worker saves the chat show host and the caveman paints another holy ghost .
so take me up to the edge of the world , and push me over again .
lead me up to the edge of the world .
there comes a time .
so take me up to the edge of the world , and push me over again .
lead me up to the edge of the world .
there comes a time .
we can storm the walls in our leisure wear while we trap the beast in his stormy lair .
then we 'll smooth his image and we 'll save his soul while we fill our schools with the gold we stole .
with some strange god and a good right hand we can chase the ghost from the promised land .
if the promised land turns out as it should we can flood the place with consumer goods .
