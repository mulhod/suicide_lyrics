# the highwayman

the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees .
the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas and the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor and the highwayman came riding , riding , riding .
yes , the highwayman came riding up to the old inn door .
over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the darkened yard and he tapped with his whip at the window , but all was locked and barred .
so he whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting there but the landlord 's black-eyed daughter , bess , the landlord 's daughter , plaiting a dark-red love knot into her long black hair .
one kiss , my bonny sweetheart , for i 'm after
a prize tonight .
but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light .
yet if they press me sharply , harry me through the day , oh , then look for me by moonlight .
watch for me by moonlight and i 'll come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way .
he did not come at the dawning .
no , he did not come at the noon .
and out of the tawny sunset , before the rise of the moon , when the road was a gypsy 's ribbon looping the purple moor , oh , a redcoat troop came marching , marching , marching , king george 's men came marching up to the old inn door and they bound the landlord 's daughter with many a sniggering jest and they bound the musket beside her with the barrel beneath her breast .
now keep good watch .
and they kissed her .
she heard the dead man say , "oh , look for me by moonlight .
watch for me by moonlight and i 'll come to thee by moonlight though hell should bar the way . "
look for me by moonlight , hoof-beats ringing clear .
watch for me by moonlight .
were they deaf that they did not hear ? for he rode on the gypsy highway .
she breathed one final breath .
then her finger moved in the moonlight .
her musket shattered the moonlight and it shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death .
oh , he turned .
he spurred on to the west .
he did not know who stood out with her black hair flowing down , drenched with her own red blood .
oh , not till the dawn had he heard it and his face grew gray to hear how bess the landlord 's daughter , the landlord 's black-eyed daughter , had watched for her love in the moonlight and died in the darkness there .
back he spurred like a madman , shrieking a curse to the sky with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high .
blood-red were his spurs in the golden noon , wine-red his velvet coat when they shot him down on the highway , down like a dog on the highway , and he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat .
and still on a winter 's night they say , when the wind is in the trees , when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas , when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor , oh , the highwayman comes riding , riding , riding .
yes , the highwayman comes riding up to the old inn door .
