#needle in the hay

your hand on his arm , the hay-stack charm around your neck , strung out and thin , calling some friend , trying to cash some check .
he 's acting dumb .
that 's what you 've come to expect .
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .
he 's wearing your clothes , head down to toes , a reaction to you .
you say you know what he did , but you idiot kid , you do n't have a clue .
sometimes they just get caught in the eye you 're pulling him through .
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .
now on the bus , nearly touching this dirty retreat , falling out , 6th and powell , a dead sweat in my teeth .
going to walk , walk , walk four more blocks plus the one in my brain , down downstairs to the man .
he 's going to make it all ok .
i ca n't beat myself , i ca n't beat myself and i do n't want to talk .
i 'm taking the cure , so i can be quiet whenever i want .
so leave me alone .
you ought to be proud that i 'm getting good marks .
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .
