#colony

a cry for help .
a hint of anaesthesia .
the sound from broken homes .
we used to always meet here .
as he lays asleep , she takes him in her arms .
some things i have to do , but i do n't mean you harm .
a worried parent 's glance .
a kiss .
a last goodbye .
hands him the bag she packed .
the tears she tries to hide .
a cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy and leaves him standing cold here in this colony .
i ca n't see why all these confrontations .
i ca n't see why all these dislocations .
no family life .
this makes me feel uneasy .
stood alone here in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony .
dear , god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand .
god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand .
god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand .
god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony .
