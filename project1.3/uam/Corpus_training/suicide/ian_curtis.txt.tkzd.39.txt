#interzone

i walked through the city limits .
someone talked me in to do it .
attracted by some force within it , fad to close my eyes to get close to it .
around a corner where a prophet lay , saw the place where she had a room to stay , a wire fence where the children played .
saw the bed where the body lay and i was looking for a friend of mine .
and i had no time to waste .
yeah , looking for some friends of mine .
the cars screeched .
hear the sound on dust .
heard a noise . just a car outside , metallic blue turned red with rust .
pulled in close by the building 's side in a group , all forgotten youth .
had to think , collect .
my senses now are turned onto a knife-edged view .
find some places where my friends do n't know .
and i was looking for a friend of mine .
and i had no time to waste .
yeah , looking for some friends of mine .
down the dark streets the houses looked the same .
getting darker now .
faces look the same .
and i walked around and around .
no stomach .
torn apart .
nail me to a train .
had to think again .
trying to find a clue .
trying to find a way to get out !
trying to move away .
had to move away and keep out .
four , twelve windows , ten in a row , behind a wall .
well , i looked down low .
the lights shined like a neon show .
inserted deep .
felt a warmer glow .
no place to stop .
no place to go .
no time to lose .
had to keep on going .
i guessed they died some time ago .
i guessed they died some time ago .
and i was looking for a friend of mine .
and i had no time to waste .
yeah , looking for some friends of mine .
