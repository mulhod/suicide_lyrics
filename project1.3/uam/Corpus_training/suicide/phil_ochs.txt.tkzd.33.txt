#my kingdom for a car

i 've found my freedom .
her and i been flying down that highway of gold .
my shirtsleeves are rolled .
my colt 45 is cold .
i go fast till i 'm going faster .
look how far we 've come , look how far .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
how i love the highway .
picks me up and takes me wherever i please .
i race through the trees , bring space to her knees .
i am master of all that 's flying past me .
look how far we 've come , look how far .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
look how far we 've come , look how far .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
take me to tomorrow .
let me go on racing with the wind in my hair .
there 's smoke in the air , but i do not care .
if you want me , you will have to pass me .
look how far we 've come , look how far .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
come to me , baby .
we will leave this town .
it was not made for a man .
we 'll find a new land , but the traffic is jammed .
i went far , but it 's a time for walking .
look how far we 've come , look how far .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
a car , a car , my kingdom for a car .
