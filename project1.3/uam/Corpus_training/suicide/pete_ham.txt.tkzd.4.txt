#shine on

shine on , shine on me .
all i know is now i want you close to me .
i ca n't really tell you what the future 's going to be .
just for now , little lady , shine on me .
lean on , lean on me .
something tells me that 's the way it 's gotta be .
i ca n't really show you what the future 's going to be .
just for now , little lady , lean on me .
to fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane .
do n't think of tomorrow .
yesterday is past .
and , if you could , you know we could make it last .
drink on , drink on me .
slip and slide , so i 'll forget reality .
i ca n't really say if i 'll come on and get so free .
just for now , little lady , drink on me .

just for now , little lady , shine on me .
just for now , little lady , shine on me .
