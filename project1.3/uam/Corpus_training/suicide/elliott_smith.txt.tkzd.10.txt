#cupid 's trick

she 's shaking down .
i 'm absent and numb from shock , reaching around for the hands of the clock .
should 've lied .
lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up .
cupid 's trick comes down to shake and deal the stupid kick that makes me real .
should 've lied .
lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up .
she 's shaking down .
it 's never over and done .
so , kick me , cane me .
then i 'll know why .
lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up .
