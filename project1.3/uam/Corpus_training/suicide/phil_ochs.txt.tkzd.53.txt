#days of decision

oh , the shadows of doubt are in many a mind , looking for an answer they 're never going to find , but they 'd better decide because they 're running out of time for these are the days of decision .
oh , the games of stalling you cannot afford .
dark is the danger that 's knocking on the door and the far-reaching rockets say you ca n't wait anymore for these are the days of decision .
in the face of the people who know they 're going to win , there 's a strength that 's greater than the power of the wind and you ca n't stand around when the ice is growing thin for these are the days of decision .
i 've seen your heads hiding beneath the blankets of fear when the paths they are plain and the choices are clear , but with each passing day , boys , the cost is more dear for these are the days of decision .
there 's many a cross that burns in the night and the fingers of the fire are pointing as they bite .
oh , you ca n't let the smoke keep on blinding all your sight for these are the days of decision .
now , the mobs of anger are roaming the street .
from the rooftops they are aiming at the police on the beat .
and in city after city you know they will repeat for these are the days of decision .
there 's been warnings of fire , warnings of flood .
now there 's the warning of the bullet and the blood from the three bodies buried in the mississippi mud , saying these are the days of decision .
there 's a change in the wind and a split in the road .
you can do what 's right or you can do what you are told .
and the prize of the victory will belong to the bold .
yes , these are the days of decision .
