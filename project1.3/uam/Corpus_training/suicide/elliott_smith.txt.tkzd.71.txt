#seen how things are hard

i took you to the train .
stupid shit you displayed .
i took pictures in my head .
you , an opening stare only , had a little dressy date , just did n't care .
you were all getting drunk instead .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , do n't you know ?
listening to what you thought was a dizzy height , freaked out and forgot you stay well away from trouble that you caused , using all your strength to keep the world at an arm 's length and not get upset because something goes wrong .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , dont you know ?
i 'm a crap reflection of you .
i cant make corrections for you .
you have to help me patch things up .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , do n't you know ?
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , do n't you know ?
