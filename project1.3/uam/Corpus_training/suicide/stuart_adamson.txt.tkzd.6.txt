#heart of the world

i believe in strangers , wherever they may be .
all the souls who shape the world look pretty strange to me .
never met no president or shook a gandhi 's hand , but i believe we need a love that they may understand .
heart of the world , heart of the world is black without the love , love to bring it back .
heart of the world , heart of the world is blue without the love , love of me and you .
i believe in heroes , whoever they may be .
i never saved no universe or set mandela free .
never sang with lennon or played in jimi 's band .
i believe we need a love that they would understand .
heart of the world , heart of the world is black , without the love , love to bring it back .
heart of the world , heart of the world is blue , without the love , love of me and you .
i believe in strangers , wherever they may be .
all the souls who shape the world look pretty strange to me .
i believe in anyone , whoever they may be who feels the love that i feel and who sees the need i see .
heart of the world , heart of the world is black , without the love , love to bring it back .
heart of the world , heart of the world is blue , without the love , love of me and you .
heart of the world , heart of the world is black without the love , the love to bring it back .
i tell you , heart of the world , heart of the world is blue , without the love , the love of me and you .
