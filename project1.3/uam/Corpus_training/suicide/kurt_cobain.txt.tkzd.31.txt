i 'm so happy because today i 've found my friends .
they 're in my head .
i 'm so ugly , but that 's okay because so are you .
we 've broken our mirrors .
sunday morning is every day for all i care and i 'm not scared .
light my candles in a daze because i 've found god .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
i 'm so lonely , but that 's okay .
i shaved my head .
and i 'm not sad and just maybe i 'm to blame for all i 've heard .
but i 'm not sure .
i 'm so excited .
i ca n't wait to meet you there .
but i do n't care .
i 'm so horny , but that 's okay .
my will is good .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey , hey .
i like it .
i 'm not going to crack .
i miss you .
i 'm not going to crack .
i love you .
i 'm not going to crack .
i killed you .
i 'm not going to crack .

i 'm not going to crack .
i miss you .
i 'm not going to crack .
