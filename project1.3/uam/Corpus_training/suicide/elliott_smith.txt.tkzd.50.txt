#shooting star

you 'll make the scene like you always do , going upstream down the avenue to fuck some trophy boy that you 'll win tonight at the bar .
so bad , so far .
you 'll make him sad , shooting star .
when it was me , i was momentarily proud , drunk on dreams now i 'm glad i did n't say out loud .
you said you 'd be for real , but i do n't believe that you are .
so bad , so far .
you make me sad , shooting star .
you 're distant and cold and a sight to behold .
everybody just sighs .
but no one gets on with you very long because you do n't feel bad when you lie .
i 'm going to sleep now , going back to find square one .
square two be where i can deal with the shit you 've just done .
it wo n't be soon .
say the least , it 's going to be hard .
so bad , so far .
your love is sad , shooting star .
your love is sad , shooting star .
