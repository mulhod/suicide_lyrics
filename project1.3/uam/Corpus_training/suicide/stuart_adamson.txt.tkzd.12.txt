#peace in our time

who holds the money ?
who holds the need ?
who holds the strings of misery , or the purse of greed ?
and the gunmen reap while the gangsters sow , and law is cheap when the smugglers go .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
while i have a life to live , then i have no life to give .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
in sun kissed rooms , in city slums , minds are restless till the airmail comes .
from the forest floor to the western mind , a chat show topic on a party line .
and the hardest love of all is to forgive as the world comes tumbling down .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
while i have a life to live , then i have no life to give .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
let all the rain come down on blind desire .
and like a thundercloud that holds a prairie fire .
i hear the blame , and i see the cause : a stronger voice and a stronger law .
but buyers buy and sellers sell public consumption of a private hell .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
while i have a life to live , then i have no life to give .
give us peace .
they 're gonna give us peace in our time .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
give us peace .
give us peace in our time .
while i have a life to live , then i have no life to give .
give us peace .
yeah , give us peace in our time .
