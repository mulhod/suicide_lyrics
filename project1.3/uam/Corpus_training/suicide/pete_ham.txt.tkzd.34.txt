#meanwhile back at the ranch

why do you think me so hard to get ?
is there something they might regret ?
is it better to just forget , just forget ?
if they only would let us know , then we 'd know just how far to go , but instead they just tell us "no" , tell us "no" .
you , you always played the fool .
you always played the fool .
you always break the rule at every single school , you know .
you always break the rule .
it always pulled you down .
they could always pull you down .
you , you never stayed the same .
you never stayed the same and now you take the blame for all the little games they play .
you always take the blame and let it bring you down .
why 'd you let it bring you down ?
