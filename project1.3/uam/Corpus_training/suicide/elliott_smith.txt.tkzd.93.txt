#waltz # 1

every time the day darkens down and goes away , pictures open in my head of me and you , silent and cliche , all the things we did and did n't say , covered up by what we did and did n't do , going through every out i used to cop to make the repetition stop .
what was i supposed to say ?
now i never leave my zone .
we 're both alone .
i 'm going home .
i wish i 'd never seen your face .
