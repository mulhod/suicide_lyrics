here are the young men , the weight on their shoulders .
here are the young men .
well , where have they been ?
we knocked on the doors of hell 's darker chamber .
pushed to the limit , we dragged ourselves in .
watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying .
we saw ourselves now as we never had seen .
portrayal of the trauma and degeneration , the sorrows we suffered and never were free .
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
weary inside , now our heart 's lost forever .
ca n't replace the fear or the thrill of the chase .
each ritual showed up .
the door for our wanderings open , then shut , then slammed in our face .
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
