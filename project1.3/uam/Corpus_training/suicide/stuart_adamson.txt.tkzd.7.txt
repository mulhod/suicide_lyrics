# i 'm not ashamed

we all make our plans .
we all have our choices .
try on different faces ; talk in other voices .
i said a lot of things that never let me sleep.
made promises i really meant to keep.
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i took the blame when i could have run .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i know i stayed when i could have gone .
i do n't expect it to be easy for me .
we 're tied together by a simple little pledge .
before we know the trust it takes to walk up to that edge we build a house of cards where the wind has always blown .
we build our little garden on a bed of sand and stone .
it took too long for me to be who i am .
maybe it 's enough for me to be it when i can .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i took the blame when i could have run .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i know i stayed when i could have gone .
our little houses where the wind has always blown , our little garden on a bed of sand and stone .
we drift along in quiet waters on the tide .
we rise and fall in rhythm almost satisfied .
we let ourselves be down .
we let ourselves be used .
i only ever wanted to be taken in by you .
it took too long for me to be who i am .
maybe it 's enough for me to be it when i can .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i took the blame when i could have run .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i know i stayed when i could have gone .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i took the blame when i could have run .
i 'm not ashamed of the things i 've done .
i know i stayed when i could have gone .
i do n't expect it to be easy for me .
