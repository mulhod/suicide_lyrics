#punch and judy

a wallflower punch talks to judy in a crowded corner where anybody can listen in , but they do n't read page to page or speak easy .
now they 're going to go say the words in the wrong order again .
they walk in a circle through all the sidewalk scenes they used to be a part of one time .
now everybody just stares and whispers , driving around up and down division street .
i used to like it here .
it just bums me out to remember .
ca n't you ever treat anyone nice ?
i think i 'm going to make the same mistake twice .
they draw the curtain , wait for a call .
pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all .
ca n't you ever treat anyone nice ?
i think i 'm going to make the same mistake twice .
i 'm going to make the same mistake twice .
