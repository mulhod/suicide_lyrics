# just a shadow

it went so well for you , with a place right where you wanted , and the ones to fill it too .
but some blows break the spell that it hits you everyday until you need to hit as well .
it 's just a shadow of the man you should be .
like a garden in the forest that the world will never see .
you have no thought of answers only questions to be filled , and it feels like hell .
it all seems fine for you till the struggle of ambition turned in violence upon you .
sometimes a landslide comes .
if you 're hiding in that avalanche , you need a place to run .
it 's just a shadow of the woman you should be .
like a garden in the forest that the world will never see .
you have no thought of answers only questions to be filled , and it feels like hell .
i know there is no need for what 's been done .
i know there is enough for everyone , but frustration brings a heavy hand to bear , and there 's never been a hand .
did we ever have it good ?
while we lived in el dorado did we find the gold we should ?
if it really was the truth , why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth ?
it 's just a shadow of the people we should be .
like a garden in the forest that the world will never see .
you have no thought of answers only questions to be filled , and it feels like hell .
know there is no need for what 's been done .
i know there is enough for everyone , but frustration brings a heavy hand to bear , and there never is a hand outside that cares .
still the promise comes of living fit for it all .
if we only get our back against the wall ,
i look at backs that push the wall for years .
scarred by many knives and too much fear .
