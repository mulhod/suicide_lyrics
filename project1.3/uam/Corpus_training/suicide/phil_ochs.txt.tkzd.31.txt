#one way ticket home

i 'd like a one-way ticket home , ticket home , where i can watch television , talk on the telephone .
but every town i wander there 's a billboard on a throne .
ticket home , i want a ticket home .
does anybody know my name or recognize my face ?
i must have come from somewhere , but i ca n't recall the place .
they dropped me at the matinee .
they left without a trace .
ticket home , i want a ticket home .
elvis presley is the king .
i was at his crowning .
my life just flashed before my eyes .
i must be drowning .
seems like only yesterday i climbed aboard the plane , raping distance in the skies , while diving in champagne .
i would be in exile now , but everywhere 's the same .
