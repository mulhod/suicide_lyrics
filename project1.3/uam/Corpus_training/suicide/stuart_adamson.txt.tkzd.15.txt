# the teacher

we talked and smoked all through the night .
you led me where i had no sight till birdsong broke the morning light .
and i was weak with strange delight .
teacher will you show to me the bond between the land and sea ?
i am new to mystery .
i want everything laid out for me , all of history , all of history .
you showed me walls around the world where seekers passed and flags unfurled .
you wove a tale in silken curls , and blew the mist in silver swirls .
teacher will you show to me the bond between the land and sea ?
i am new to mystery .
i want everything laid out for me , all of history , all of history .
teacher will you show to me the bond between the land and sea ?
i am new to mystery .
i want everything laid out for me , all of history , all of history , all of history , all of history .
