#color bars

i see color bars when i come .
sargeant rock broke the key off in the lock to where i come from .
sir , no , sir , we have no power in the air .
the battle 's on the ground .
laying low again , high on the sound .
bruno s . is a man to me .
you 're just some dude with a stilted attitude that you learned from tv.
you 'll undo , but i 'll be connecting everything , the traffic in my town , riding high again , high on the sound .
everyone wants me to ride into the sun , but i be not going to go down .
laying low again , high on the sound .
