# i 'll be there

when the river of rebellion overflows , i 'll be there .
when the seed of discontent plants and grows , i 'll be there , watching for the sun through the dark and rainy storm , searching for the keys to the dungeons old and worn .
let me tell you .
i 'll be there .
when the shadow of the tyrant falls and sweeps across the land , when men would steal from others with paper in their hand , when people search for answers and the answers never come , when their troubles would be over if they thought and fought as one , let me tell you .
i 'll be there .
whispering of yesterday has grown into a roar , winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore .
when the time is ready and the call is loud and clear , let me tell you .
i 'll be there .
when the thunder of oppression roars and crackles , i 'll be there .
when those who would be free are wearing shackles , i 'll be there for the day is going to come when they 'll throw away their chains , lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains and let me tell you .
i 'll be there .
whispering of yesterday has turned into a roar , winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore .
when the time is ready and the call is loud and clear , let me tell you .
i 'll be there .
when the thunder of opression roars and crackles , i 'll be there .
when those who would be free are wearing shackles , i 'll be there for the day is going to come when they 'll throw away their chains , lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains and let me tell you , let me tell you , let me tell you , let me tell you .
i 'll be there .
