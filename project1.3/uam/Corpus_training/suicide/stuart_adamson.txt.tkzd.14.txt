#ships ( where were you )

look at him now , another used man .
wearing the passing of his dignity with all the courage that he can .
he stood in the storm , carved out in stone .
he said i 've worn my honesty with pride in everything i 've done .
so where were you when my ship went down ?
where were you when i ran aground ?
where were you when i turned it around ?
where were you when they burned me down ?
where were you when my ship went down ?
where were you when i ran aground ?
where were you when i turned it around ?
where were you when they burned me down ?
look at her now , all tired and worn .
she never thought her life would come to be so cold or so alone .
she walked in the light , fought bondage for love .
she said i cast off the chains that i was born with , but it never was enough .
and where were you when my ship went down ?
where were you when i ran aground ?
where were you when i turned it around ?
where were you when they burned me down ?
where were you when my ship went down ?
where were you when i ran aground ?
where were you when i turned it around ?
where were you when they burned me down ?
silent souls washed up on the shore left to walk the sands evermore , evermore .
look at you now , just chasing your life .
make like the saviour of the planet .
you 're just trying to get by .
now you may walk the line , you may see it all through , but i know you cry yourself to sleep at night just wondering what to do .
so where were you when my ship went down ?
where were you when i ran aground ?
where were you when i turned it around ?
where were you when they burned me down ?
where were you when my ship went down ?
where were you when i ran aground ?
where were you when i turned it around ?
where were you when they burned me down ?
