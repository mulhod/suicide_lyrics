alone

the midday sky was grey and purple .
at least it was n't blue .
i want the sky to be the way i am , and what i do ?
for i have been a lost and lonely sailor on your sea .
run aground by trusting signals you were sending me .
the streets are filled with empty faces , nothing here is new .
it 's just the same in other places i have journeyed to .
i was the first across the water , the last across the land .
i walked out of the silver mine my pockets full of sand .
alone inside my head .
alone inside my room .
i feel alone inside my head , alone inside my tiny little world .
it 's not my life in those old pictures , the ones you threw away .
for i was always someone else and always far away .
walking in the darkest places where the mission meets , waiting for the ground to open up beneath my feet .
alone inside my head .
alone inside my room .
i feel alone inside my head alone inside my tiny little world .
alone inside my head .
alone inside my room .
i feel alone inside my head alone inside my tiny little world .
