#carry on till tomorrow

in younger days , i told myself my life would be my own and i 'd leave the place where sunshine never shone for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the rising sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on till tomorow .
there 's no reason to look back .
carry on , carry on , carry on beyond the shadows of the clouds and onward to the sky .
carry on till i find the rainbow 's end for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the rising sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on till tomorow .
there 's no reason to look back .
carry on , carry on , carry on .
drifting on the wings of freedom , leave this stormy day and we 'll ride to tomorrow 's golden fields for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the rising sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on , carry on , carry on .
and , when the heavy journey 's done , i 'll rest my weary head for the world and its colours will be mine for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the setting sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on till tomorow .
there 's no reason to look back .
carry on , carry on , carry on .
