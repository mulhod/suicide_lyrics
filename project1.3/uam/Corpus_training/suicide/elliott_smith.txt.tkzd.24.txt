# the biggest lie

i 'm waiting for the train , the subway that only goes one way , the stupid thing that will come to pull us apart and make everybody late .
you spent everything you had , wanted everything to stop that bad and now i 'm a crushed credit card registered to smith , not the name that you call me with .
you turned white like a saint .
i 'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold-flake paint .
oh , we 're so very precious , you and i , and everything that you do makes me want to die .
oh , i just told the biggest lie .
i just told the biggest lie , the biggest lie .
