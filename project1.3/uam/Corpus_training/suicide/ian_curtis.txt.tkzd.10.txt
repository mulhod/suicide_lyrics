#transmission

radio , live transmission .
radio , live transmission .
listen to the silence .
let it ring on .
eyes , dark grey lenses frightened of the sun .
we would have a fine time living in the night , left to blind destruction , waiting for our sight .
and we would go on as though nothing was wrong and hide from these days .
we remained all alone , staying in the same place , just staying out the time , touching from a distance , further all the time .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
well , i could call out when the going gets tough .
the things that we 've learnt are no longer enough .
no language , just sound , that 's all we need know to synchronise love to the beat of the show .
and we could dance .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
