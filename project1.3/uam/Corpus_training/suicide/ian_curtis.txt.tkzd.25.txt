#ice age

i 've seen the real atrocities , buried in the sand , stockpiled for safety while we stand holding hands .
i 'm living in the ice age .
i 'm living in the ice age .
nothing will hold .
nothing will fit into the cold .
it 's not an eclipse .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
searching for another way , hide behind the door .
we 'll live in holes and disused shafts , hopes for little more .
i 'm living in the ice age .
i 'm living in the ice age .
nothing will hold .
nothing will fit into the cold .
no smile on your lips .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
