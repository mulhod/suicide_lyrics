#east of eden

i feel the way the wind blows .
it tells me where you 've been through .
i watch the way the sun sets until the night 's inside you .
some days i just do n't worry .
i let it pour through me .
some days i need to bury the very depths of me .
so i wait to the east of eden , i let salvation be .
i was waiting , i was watching
would it ever be there for me ?
when i felt that hope and a lucky card where all i had to walk with me , had to walk with me .
i watch the way the crow flies and though it seems so easy .
but if i see it in a grey sky , can i be sure about the way it leaves me ?
some days i just do n't worry .
i let it pour through me .
some days i need to call upon the very depths of me .
so i wait out here to the east of eden .
i watch your soul run free .
i was waiting , i was watching , would it ever be there for me ?
when i felt that hope and a lucky card where all i had to walk with me .
i was waiting .
i was watching .
would it ever be there for me ?
when i felt that hope and a lucky card where all i had to walk with me .
some days will stay a thousand years .
some pass like the flash of spark .
who knows where all our days go ?
out here we lie together .
outside the thunder gathers .
why care about the weather , it always ends in dark .
i looked west in search of freedom , and i saw slavery .
i looked east in search of answers , and i saw mysery .
some days i just do n't worry .
i let it pour through me .
some days i walk into the very depths of me .
so i wait out here to the east of eden .
i let my conscience be .
i was waiting .
i was watching .
would it ever be there for me ?
when i felt that hope and a lucky card where all i had to walk with me .
i was waiting .
i was watching .
would it ever be there for me ?
when i felt that hope and a lucky card where all i had to walk with me .
