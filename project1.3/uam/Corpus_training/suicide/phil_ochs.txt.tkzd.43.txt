#draft dodger rag

oh , i 'm just a typical american boy from a typical american town .
i believe in god and senator dodd and keeping old castro down .
and , when it came my time to serve , i knew "better dead than red " .
but , when i got to my old draft board , buddy , this is what i said .
sarge , i 'm only eighteen .
i got a ruptured spleen and i always carry a purse .
i got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma 's getting worse .
yes , think of my career , my sweetheart dear , and my poor old invalid aunt .
besides , i be not no fool , i 'm going to school , and i 'm working in a defense plant .
i 've got a dislocated disc and a wracked-up back .
i 'm allergic to flowers and bugs .
and , when the bombshell hits , i get epileptic fits and i 'm addicted to a thousand drugs .
i got the weakness woes .
i ca n't touch my toes .
i can hardly reach my knees .
and , if the enemy came close to me , i 'd probably start to sneeze .
sarge , i 'm only eighteen .
i got a ruptured spleen and i always carry a purse .
i got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma 's getting worse .
yes , think of my career , my sweetheart dear , and my poor old invalid aunt .
besides , i be not no fool , i 'm going to school , and i 'm working in a defense plant .
oh , i hate chou en lai and i hope he dies .
one thing you got to see , that someone 's got to go over there , and that someone is n't me , so i wish you well , sarge .
give them hell !
kill me a thousand or so .
and , if you ever get a war without blood and gore , i 'll be the first to go .
yes , i 'm only eighteen .
i got a ruptured spleen and i always carry a purse .
i got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma 's getting worse .
yes , think of my career , my sweetheart dear , and my poor old invalid aunt .
besides , i be not no fool , i 'm going to school , and i 'm working in a defense plant .
