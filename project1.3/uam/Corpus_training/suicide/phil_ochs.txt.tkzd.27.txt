#bound for glory

he walked all over his own growing land from the new york island to the california sand .
he saw all the people that needed to be seen , planted all the grass where it needed to be green .
and now he 's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory .
he wrote and he sang and he rode upon the rails and he got on board when the sailors had to sail .
he said all the words that needed to be said .
he fed all the hungry souls that needed to be fed .
and now he 's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory .
he sang in our streets and he sang in our halls and he was always there when the unions gave a call .
he did all the jobs that needed to be done .
he always stood his ground when a smaller man would run .
and now he 's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory .
and it 's "pastures of plenty" , wrote the dustbowl balladeer .
and " this land is your land " he wanted us to hear .
and the rising of the unions will be sung about again and the deportees live on through the power of his pen .
and now he 's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory .
now they sing out his praises on every distant shore , but so few remember what he was fighting for .
oh , why sing the songs and forget about the aim ?
he wrote them for a reason .
why not sing them for the same ?
and now he 's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory .
