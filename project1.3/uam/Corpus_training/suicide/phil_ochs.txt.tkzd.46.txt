#iron lady

have you seen the iron lady 's charms , legs of steel , leather on her arms , taking on a man to die ?
a life for a life .
an eye for an eye .
and death 's the iron lady in the chair .
stop the murder .
deter the crimes away .
only killing shows that killing does n't pay .
yes , that 's the kind of law it takes even though we make mistakes and sometimes send the wrong man to the chair .
in the death-row waiting for their turn , no time to change , not a chance to learn , waiting for someone to call , say , "it 's over , after all . "
they wo n't have to face the justice of the chair .
just before they serve him one last meal , shave his head , they ask him how he feels .
then the warden comes to say goodbye .
reporters come to watch him die , watch him as he 's strapped into the chair .
and the chaplain , he reads the final prayer .
be brave , my son .
the lord is waiting there .
oh , murder is so wrong , you see .
both the bible and the courts agree that the state 's allowed to murder in the chair .
in the courtroom , watch the balance of the scales .
if the price is right , there 's time for more appeals .
the strings are pulled , the switch is stayed , the finest lawyers ' fees are paid and a rich man never died upon the chair .
have you seen the iron lady 's charms , legs of steel , leather on her arms , taking on a man to die ?
a life for a life .
an eye for an eye .
and death 's the iron lady in the chair .
