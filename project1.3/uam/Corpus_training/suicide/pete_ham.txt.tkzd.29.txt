#day after day

i remember finding out about you .
every day my mind is all around you .
looking out from my lonely room day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .
i remember holding you while you sleep.
every day i feel the tears that you weep.
looking out of my lonely gloom day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .
looking out of my lonely room day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .
i remember finding out about you .
every day my mind is all around you .
looking out of my lonely gloom day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .
