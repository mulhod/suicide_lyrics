#links on the chain

come , you ranks of labor , come , you union core , and see if you remember the struggles of before , when you were standing helpless on the outside of the door and you started building links on the chain , on the chain , you started building links on the chain , wwhen the police on the horses were waiting on demand , riding through the strike with the pistols in their hands , swinging at the skulls of many a union man as you built one more link on the chain , on the chain , as you built one more link on the chain .
then the army of the fascists tried to put you on the run , but the army of the union , they did what could be done .
oh , the power of the factory was greater than the gun as you built one more link on the chain , on the chain , as you built one more link on the chain .
and then in 1954 , decisions finally made , the black man was rising fast and racing from the shade and your union took no stand and your union was betrayed , as you lost yourself a link on the chain , on the chain , as you lost yourself a link on the chain .
and then there came the boycotts and then the freedom rides and , forgetting what you stood for , you tried to block the tide .
oh , the automation bosses were laughing on the side , as they watched you lose your link on the chain , on the chain , as they watched you lose your link on the chain .
you know when they block your trucks , boys , by laying on the road , all that they are doing is all that you have showed , that you got to strike , you got to fight to get what you are owed when you�re building all your links on the chain , on the chain , when you�re building all your links on the chain .
and the man who tries to tell you that they�ll take your job away , he�s the same man who was scabbing hard just the other day and your union�s not a union till he�s thrown out of the way and he�s choking on your links of the chain , of the chain , and he�s choking on your links of the chain for now the times are telling you the times are rolling on and you�re fighting for the same thing , the jobs that will be gone .
now , it �s only fair to ask you , boys , which side are you on ? as you�re building all your links on the chain , on the chain , as you�re building all your links on the chain .
