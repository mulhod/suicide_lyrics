# i 'll be the one

where did you go when you were needed ?
was it some place i know , where they care ?
cries in the rain .
i 'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart .
i 'll be the one .
we 'll be together .
i 'll be the one forever and ever .
look at me now .
am i the loser ?
if you ca n't tell me how , tell me why .
but just the same , i 'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart .
i 'll be the one .
we 'll be together .
i 'll be the one forever and ever and ever .
i 'll be the one .
we 'll be together .
i 'll be the one forever and ever and ever .
