# a means to an end

a legacy so far removed one day will be improved .
eternal rights we left behind .
we were the better kind .
two the same .
set free , too .
i always looked to you .
i always looked to you .
i always looked to you .
we fought for good , stood side by side , our friendship never died .
on stranger waves , the lows and highs , our vision touched the sky .
immortalists with points to prove .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
a house somewhere on foreign soil , where ageless lovers call .
is this your goal , your final needs , where dogs and vultures eat ?
committed still , i turn to go .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you , in you , in you , in you .
put my trust in you , in you .
