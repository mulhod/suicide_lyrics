#big decision

pick me up in an hour or so .
i do n't really recommend it , no .
they 'll probably just put you down .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
you ca n't kick when you 're down .
got a feeling kind of like a cough .
be not nothing going to shake it off , be not nothing going to shake it off until you talk out loud .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
you ca n't kick when you 're down .
the chromium car reflects you are .
taking you home , i 'm under your spell .
ca n't you tell ?
do n't you know ?
god , people wonder if you 're sick , spilled out on the city slick , buffed up like a macho jerk .
do n't even try it .
it 'll never work .
why , you wonder ?
what , you wonder , for me ?
why , you wonder ?
what , you wonder , for me ?
why you want what i can not be ?
you know i wo n't stay sober .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
you ca n't kick when you 're down .
