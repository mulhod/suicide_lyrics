#power and the glory

come and take a walk with me through this green and growing land .
walk through the meadows and the mountains and the sand .
walk through the valleys and the rivers and the plains .
walk through the sun and walk through the rain .
here is a land full of power and glory , beauty that words cannot recall .
oh , her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom .
her glory shall rest on us all , on us all .
from colorado , kansas , and the carolinas too , virginia and alaska , from the old to the new , texas and ohio and the california shore , tell me , who could ask for more ?
yet she 's only as rich as the poorest of her poor , only as free as the padlocked prison door , only as strong as our love for this land , only as tall as we stand .
but our land is still troubled by men who have to hate .
they twist away our freedom and they twist away our fate .
fear is their weapon and treason is their cry .
we can stop them if we try .
