#knock on the door

in many a time , in many a land , with many a gun in many a hand , they came by the night , they came by the day , came with their guns to take us away .
with a knock on the door , knock on the door , here they come to take one more , one more .
back in the days of the roman empire , they died by the cross and they died by the fire .
in the stone coliseum , the crowd gave a roar and it all began with that knock on the door , just a knock on the door , knock on the door .
here they come to take one more , one more .
the years have all passed .
we 've reached modern times .
the nazis have come with their nazi war crimes .
yes , the power was there .
the power was found .
six million people have heard that same sound , that old knock on the door , knock on the door .
here they come to take one more , one more .
now there 's many new words and many new names , the banners have changed , but the knock is the same .
on the soviet shores with right on their side , i wonder who knows how many have died .
with their knock on the door , knock on the door , here they come to take one more one more .
look over the oceans .
look over the lands .
look over the leaders with the blood on their hands .
and open your eyes and see what they do .
when they knock over their friend , they 're knocking for you .
with their knock on the door , knock on the door , here they come to take one more .
with their knock on the door , knock on the door , here they come to take one more , one more .
