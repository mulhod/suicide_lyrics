# the only mistake

made the fatal mistake , like i did once before , a tendency just to take till the purpose turned sour .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
yeah , the only mistake was that you ran away , avenues lined with trees , strangled words for the day .
yeah , the only mistake , like i made once before .
yeah , the only mistake .
could have made it before .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
and the only mistake led to rumours unfound , led to pressures unknown , different feelings and sounds .
yeah , the only mistake , like i made once before .
yeah , the only mistake .
could have made it before .
