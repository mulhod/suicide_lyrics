#you dreamer

down at the corner store , never busy any more , he 's in the back room talking pie .
in there all by himself counting bugs up on the shelf , watching the window fill with flies .
oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
meanwhile in the great indoors , pizza boxes on the floor prescription junkies pass the day .
tv actors screw around wrapped in silk and dressing gowns , a grown up drama for a day .
oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
you know there 's house on victory street where no one wipes their feet .
a car is rusting in the yard .
mommy scrubs and daddy scores , keeps his stash beneath the floor , under the bed of baby blue .
i need a guide book .
get me a map .
not even indiana jones could deal with that .
the tank is empty .
a wheel came off .
how can someone find me if no one knows i 'm lost , hey if no one knows i 'm lost ?
oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for .
