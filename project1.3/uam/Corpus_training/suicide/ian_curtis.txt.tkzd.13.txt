this is the hour when the mysteries emerge , a strangeness so hard to reflect , a moment so moving , goes straight to your heart .
the vision has never been met .
the attraction is held like a weight deep inside , something i 'll never forget .
the pattern is set .
her reaction will start , complete but rejected too soon .
looking ahead in the grip of each fear recalls the life that we knew .
the shadow that stood by the side of the road always reminds me of you .
how can i find the right way to control all the conflicts inside , all the problems beside as the questions arise and the answers do n't fit into my way of things , into my way of things ?
