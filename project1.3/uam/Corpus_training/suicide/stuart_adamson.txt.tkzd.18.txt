#hold the heart

sun beats hard on an empty beach where i tried so hard , but could n't reach the stars in your eyes .
you were just a child when i came to you , and we were friends 'till love stepped in , and you stepped away .
i would lie and curse the day , and visit places where we lay alone , and find them turned to stone .
because you hold the heart of someone new .
i 'll take a chance on time .
hold out here for something true , standing out of line .
but i would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
the way you will again .
i fell apart , and you came to me .
i never can explain how much it turned me round , much more than upside down .
because you hold the heart of someone new .
i 'll take a chance on time .
hold out here for something true , standing out of line .
but i would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
the way you will again .
and i love the sun .
and i need the rain .
and i know the way that you left me was only to test me , and i was vain .
and i will be strong .
and i will be warm .
and i will let no one come near me until you will hear me just once again .
time will wear the mountain down , and make a lover of the clown who laughed too long , and colored you wrong .
now i hold the heart of someone new .
i 'll take a chance on time .
hold out here for something true , standing out of line .
but i would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
the way you will again .
but i would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
the way you will again .
