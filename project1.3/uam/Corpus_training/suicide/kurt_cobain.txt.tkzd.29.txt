#come as you are

come as you are , as you were , as i want you to be , as a friend , as a friend , as an old enemy .
take your time .
hurry up .
the choice is yours .
do n't be late .
take a rest as a friend , as an old memoria , memoria , memoria , memoria .
come dowsed in mud , soaked in bleach , as i want you to be , as a trend , as a friend , as an old memoria , memoria , memoria , memoria .
and i swear that i do n't have a gun .
no , i do n't have a gun .
no , i do n't have a gun .
memoria , memoria , memoria .
memoria , and i do n't have a gun
and i swear that i do n't have a gun .
no , i do n't have a gun .
no , i do n't have a gun .
no , i do n't have a gun .
no , i do n't have a gun .
memoria , memoria .
