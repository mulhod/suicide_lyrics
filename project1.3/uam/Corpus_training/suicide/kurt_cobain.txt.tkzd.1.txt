blew

if you would n't mind , i would like to blew .
if you would n't mind , i would like to lose .
if you would n't care , i would like to leave .
if you would n't mind , i would like to breathe .
is there another reason for your stain ?
could you believe who we knew was stress or strain ?
here is another word that rhymes with shame .
