#exercise one

when you 're looking at life in a strange new room , maybe drowning soon , is this the start of it all ?
turn on your tv.
turn down your pulse .
turn away from it all .
it 's all getting too much .
when you 're looking at life , deciphering scars .
just who fooled who ?
sit still in their cars .
the lights look bright when you reach outside , time for one last ride before the end of it all .
