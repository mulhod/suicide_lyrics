#look away

this time we run .
this time we hide .
this time we draw on all the fire we have inside .
we need some time to find a place where i can wipe away the madness from your face .
our name is out .
our name is known .
our name is everywhere , but who knows where we 're flown .
i never meant to kill a man , but i will show you how to live like no one can .
so look away , look away .
hide your eyes from the land where i lie cold .
look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
look away , look away from the love that i hide way down deep in my soul .
i met you wild in a snowed up town .
when i was waiting , tied , and bound to be sent down .
then i broke loose .
you were n't around .
so i raised banks and trains until i tracked you down .
now look away , look away .
hide your eyes from the land where i lie cold .
look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
look away , look away from the love that i hide way down deep in my soul .
you followed me when i said no .
you lay with me when there was nowhere safe to go .
we made some friends , but now it 's done .
i always knew that we would never find the sun .
so look away , look away .
hide your eyes from the land where i lie cold .
look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
look away , look away from the love that i hide way down deep in my soul .
now look away , look away .
hide your eyes from the land where i lie cold .
look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
look away , look away from the love that i hide way down deep in my soul .
