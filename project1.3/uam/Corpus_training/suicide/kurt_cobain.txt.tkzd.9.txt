#swap meet

they lead a lifetime that is comfortable .
they travel far to keep their stomachs full .
they make their living off of arts and crafts , the kind with seashells , driftwood , and burlap .
they make a deal when they come to town .
the sunday swap meet is a battleground .
she loves him more than he will ever know .
he loves her more than he will ever show .
keeps his cigarettes close to his heart .
keeps her photographs close to her heart .
keeps the bitterness close to the heart .
