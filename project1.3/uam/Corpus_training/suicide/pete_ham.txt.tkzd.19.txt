#midnight caller

beneath the midnight caller she thinks of paper green .
you never hear them calling her name .
they just know where they 've been .
you never hear her holler .
the tears no longer come .
she reads her daily book of the past that shows of everyone .
grey years that show in her hair .
ca n't be , but do n't seem to care .
she unlocks the door and there 's no one there .
she sees a daytime stroller walk from the night before and , though she paints a smile on her face , he wo n't be back no more .
she 's got no saint to follow .
she 's got no place to go .
too proud to ask an old friend for help .
too proud to let him know .
grey years that show in her hair .
ca n't be , but do n't seem to care .
she knocks the door and there 's no one there .
nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody 's going to help you now .
