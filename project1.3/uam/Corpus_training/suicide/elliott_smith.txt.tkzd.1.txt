speed trials

he 's pleased to meet you underneath the horse in the cathedral with the glass stained black singing sweet high notes that echo back to destroy their master .
may be a long time till you get the call-up , but it 's sure as fate and hard as your luck .
no one 'll know where you are .
it 's just a brief smile crossing your face , running speed trials still standing in place when the socket 's not a shock enough .
you little child , what makes you think you 're tough when all the people you think you 're above , they all know what 's the matter ?
you 're such a pinball .
yeah , you know it 's true .
there 's always something you come back running to , to follow the path of no resistance .
it 's just a brief smile crossing your face , running speed trials standing in place .
it 's just a brief smile crossing your face , running speed trials all over the place .
