#if you see her , say hello

if you see her , say hello .
she might be in tangier .
she left here last early spring , is living there , i hear .
say for me that i 'm alright , though things get kind of slow .
she might think that i 've forgotten her .
do n't tell her .
it is n't so .
we had a falling-out like lovers often will and to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill .
and , though our separation , it pierced me to the heart , she still lives inside of me .
we 've never been apart .
if you get close to her , kiss her once for me .
i always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free .
oh , whatever makes her happy , i wo n't stand in the way for the bitter taste still lingers on from the night i tried to make her stay .
i see a lot of people as i make the rounds and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town .
and i 've never gotten used to it .
i 've just learned to turn it off .
either i 'm too sensitive or else i 'm getting soft .
sundown , yellow moon , i replay the past .
i know every scene by heart .
they all went by so fast .
if she 's passing back this way , i 'm not that hard to find .
tell her she can look me up if she 's got the time .
