#gimmie the sweet and lowdown

it was a moonlight mishap , you lost your party hat .
seems your lifestyle be not so worthwhile after all .
a heavy-hearted taxi ride then a walk on the wild side .
did your guardian angel let you down ?
going to lay low and play it straight .
it 's time to rejuvenate .
going to kick start your heart until you come around .
i can tell you now : you 've really gotten the blues .
i can tell you now that i 've walked in your shoes .
gimme the sweet and lowdown .
you better get outta the way .
it 's history made the hard way .
from a hero to a zero once again .
aing . no time for vanity or this insanity .
you 're maladjusted , and now you 're busted once again .
i can tell you now it comes as no surprise .
i can tell you now by that look in your eyes .
gimme the sweet and lowdown .
you 're looking kinda punch drunk because that 's the way you strut your stuff , with a swing and a swagger down the road you go .
you should 've made a better choice and listened to your inner voice .
you got to get right or get left , do n't ya know .
i can tell you now : it 's the peak of bad news .
i can tell you now that i 've walked in your shoes .
gimme the sweet and lowdown , the sweet and lowdown , gimme the sweet - the sweet and lowdown .
