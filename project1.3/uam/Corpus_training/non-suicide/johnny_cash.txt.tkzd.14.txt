#big river

now i taught the weeping willow how to cry , and i showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky .
and the tears that i cried for that woman are going to flood you big river .
then i 'm going to sit right here until i die .
i met her accidentally in st . paul , and it tore me up every time i heard her drawl , southern drawl .
then i heard my dream was back downstream cavorting in davenport , and i followed you , big river , when you called .
then you took me to st . louis later on , down the river .
a freighter said she 's been here but she 's gone , boy , she 's gone .
i found her trail in memphis , but she just walked up the block .
she raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone .
now , wo n't you batter down by baton rouge , river queen , roll it on .
take that woman on down to new orleans , new orleans .
go on , i 've had enough .
dump my blues down in the gulf .
she loves you , big river , more than me .
now i taught the weeping willow how to cry , cry , cry , and i showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky .
and the tears that i cried for that woman are going to flood you big river .
then i 'm going to sit right here until i die .
