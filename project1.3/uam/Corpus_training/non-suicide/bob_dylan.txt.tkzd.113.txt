#i shall be free

well , i took me a woman late last night .
i was three-fourths drunk .
she looked alright till she started peeling off her onion gook .
she took off her wig , said , "how do i look ? "
i 's high-flying , bare-naked , out the window !
well , sometimes i might get drunk , walk like a duck , and smell like a skunk .
do n't hurt me none , it do n't hurt my pride because i got my little lady right by my side .
she 's trying to hide , pretending she do n't know me !
i 's out there painting on the old woodshed when a can of black paint did fell on my head .
i went down to scrub and rub , but i had to sit in back of the tub .
cost a quarter , half price .
well , my telephone rang .
it would not stop .
it 's president kennedy calling me up .
he said , "my friend , bob , what do we need to make the country grow ? "
i said , "my friend , john , brigitte bardot , anita ekberg , sophia loren .
country 'll grow . "
well , i got a woman , five feet short .
she yells and hollers and screams and snorts .
she tickles my nose , pats me on the head , rolls me over , and kicks me out of bed .
she 's a man-eater , meat-grinder , bad loser .
oh , there be not no use in me working all the time .
i got a woman who works herself blind .
works up to her britches , up to her neck , writes me letters , and sends me checks .
she 's a humdinger , folksinger .
late one day in the middle of the week , my eyes were closed .
i was half asleep.
i chased me a woman up the hill right in the middle of an air-raid drill .
i jumped a fallout shelter !
i jumped a string bean !
i jumped a tv dinner !
i jumped a shotgun !
now , the man on the stand , he wants my vote .
he 's running for office on the ballot note .
he 's out there preaching in front of the steeple , telling me he loves all kinds of people .
he 's eating bagels .
he 's eating pizza .
he 's eating chitlins .
oh , set me down on a television floor , i 'll flip the channel to number four .
out of the shower comes a football man with a bottle of oil in his hand , greasy kid stuff .
what i want to know , mr . football man , is what do you do about willy mays , martin luther king , olatunji ?
well , the funniest woman i ever seen was the great-granddaughter of mr . clean .
she takes about fifteen baths a day ,
wants me to grow a must 'veche on my face .
she 's insane !
well , ask me why i 'm drunk all the time .
levels my head and eases my mind .
i just walk along and stroll and sing .
i see better days and i do better things .
i catch dinosaurs !
make love to elizabeth taylor !
catch hell from richard burton !
