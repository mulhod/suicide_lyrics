# the man in me

the man in me will do nearly any task and as for compensation there 's little he would ask .
take a woman like you to get through to the man in me .
storm clouds are raging all around my door .
i think to myself i might not take it anymore .
take a woman like your kind to find the man in me .
but , oh , what a wonderful feeling just to know that you are near .
it sets my heart reeling from my toes up to my ears .
the man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen , but that 's just because he does n't want to turn into some machine .
take a woman like you to get through to the man in me .
