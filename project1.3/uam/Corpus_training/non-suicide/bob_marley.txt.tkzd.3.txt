#african herbsman

all twinkling lee , ca n't see the right rose when the streams abate .
the old slave men might grind slow , but it grinds fine , yeah .
african herbsman , why linger on ?
just concentrate , because heaven lives on .
greet-i-eth slave men will look with a scorn , with a transplanted heart .
yes , how quick they had to part .
how quick they had to part .
the remembrance of today is the sad feeling of tomorrow .
how quick , oh part , oh yeah .
african herbsman , seize your time .
i 'm taking illusion on the edge of my mind .
i 'm taking losers down through my life .
down through my life , yeah .
yes , how quick they had to part .
how quick they had to part .
dideh part , yes , they part .
in remembrance of today .
how quick they had to part .
african herbsman , why linger on ?
just concentrate , because your heaven lives on .
greet-i-eth slave men will look with a scorn , with a transplanted heart .
yes , how quick they have to part .
how quick they have to part .
in remembrance of today brings sad feelings of tomorrow .
yes , how quick they have to .
lead me on , oh , lord , i pray to you .
african herbsman , african herbsman , african , african herbsman .
