#kinda i want to

i ca n't shake this feeling from my head .
there 's a devil sleeping in my bed .
he 's watching you from across the way .
i cannot make this feeling go away .
i know it 's not the right thing , and i know it 's not the good thing but kinda i want to .
i 'm not sure of what i should do when everything i 'm think of is you .
all of my excuses turn to lies .
maybe god will cover up his eyes
i know it 's not the right thing , and i know it 's not the good thing but kinda i
want to .
and i want to , maybe just for tonight .
we can pretend it 's alright .
what 's the price i pay ?
i do n't care what they say .
i want to .
i want to .
