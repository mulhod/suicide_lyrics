#shadowboxer

once my lover , now my friend .
what a cruel thing to pretend .
what a cunning way to condescend .
once my lover , and now my friend .
oh , you creep up like the clouds and you set my soul at ease .
then you let your love abound and you bring me to my knees .
oh , it 's evil , babe , the way you let your grace enrapture me .
when will you know i 'd be insane to ever let that dirty game recapture me .
you made me a shadowboxer , baby .
i want to be ready for what you do .
i 've been swinging all around me because i do n't know when you 're going to make your move .
oh , your gaze is dangerous , and you fill your space so sweet .
if i let you get too close you 'll set your spell on me .
so darling i just want to say , just in case i do n't come through , i was on to every play .
i just wanted you .
but , oh , it 's so evil , my love , the way you 've no reverence to my concern .
so i 'll be sure to stay wary of you , love , to save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn .
you made me a shadowboxer , baby .
i want to be ready for what you do .
i 've been swinging all around me because i do n't know when you 're going to make your move .
