#on a night like this

on a night like this i 'm so glad you came around .
hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds .
we got much to talk about and much to reminisce .
it sure is right on a night like this .
on a night like this i 'm so glad you 're here to stay .
hold on to me , pretty miss , and say you 'll never go away to stray .
run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss .
it sure feels right on a night like this .
on a night like this i ca n't get any sleep.
the air is so cold outside and the snow 's so deep .
build a fire , throw on logs , and listen to it hiss .
and let it burn , burn , burn , burn on a night like this .
put your body next to mine and keep me company .
there is plenty of room for all , so please do n't elbow me .
let the four winds blow around this old cabin door .
if i 'm not too far off , i think we did this once before .
there 's more frost on the window glass with each new , tender kiss , but it sure feels right on a night like this .
