#sin

you give me the reason .
you give me control .
i gave you my purity , and my purity you stole .
did you think i would n't recognize this compromise .
am i just too stupid to realize .
stale incense , old sweat and lies , lies , lies .
it comes down to this , your kiss , your fist .
and your strain , it get 's under my skin , within , take in , the extent of my sin .
you give me the anger .
you give me the nerve .
to carry out the sentence , while i get what i deserve .
i 'm just an effigy to be defaced , to be disgraced .
your need for me has been replaced .
and if i ca n't have everything well that just gives me a taste .
it comes down to this , your kiss , your fist .
and your strain , it get 's under my skin , within , take in , the extent of my sin .
