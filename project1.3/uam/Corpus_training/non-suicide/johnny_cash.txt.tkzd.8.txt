#man in black

well , you wonder why i always dress in black .
why you never see bright colors on my back , and why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone .
well , there 's a reason for the things that i have on .
i wear the black for the poor and the beaten down , living in the hopeless , hungry side of town .
i wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime , but is there because he 's a victim of the times .
i wear the black for those who never read , or listened to the words that jesus said , about the road to happiness through love and charity .
why , you 'd think he 's talking straight to you and me .
well , we 're doing mighty fine , i do suppose , in our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes , but just so we 're reminded of the ones who are held back , up front there ought to be a man in black .
i wear it for the sick and lonely old .
for the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold .
i wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been ; each week we lose a hundred fine young men .
and , i wear it for the thousands who have died , believing that the lord was on their side .
i wear it for another hundred thousand who have died , believing that we all were on their side .
well , there 's things that never will be right i know , and things need changing everywhere you go , but till we start to make a move to make a few things right , you 'll never see me wear a suit of white .
oh , i 'd love to wear a rainbow every day , and tell the world that everything 's ok , but i 'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back .
till things are brighter , i 'm the man in black .
