#guiltiness

guiltiness , talking about guiltiness , pressed on their conscience , oh , yeah .
and they live their lives , they live their lives , on false pretence every day , each and every day , yeah .
these are the big fish who always try to eat down the small fish , just the small fish .
i tell you what : they would do anything to materialize their every wish , oh , yeah .
say woe to the downpressors .
they 'll eat the bread of sorrow !
woe to the downpressors .
they 'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow !
woe to the downpressors .
they 'll eat the bread of sorrow , oh , yeah , oh , yeah !
guiltiness pressed on their conscience , oh , yeah , oh , yeah !

i tell you what : they would do anything to materialize their every wish , oh , yeah .
but woe to the downpressors .
they 'll eat the bread of sorrow !
woe to the downpressors .
they 'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow !
woe to the downpressors .
they 'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow , oh , yeah , oh , yeah !
