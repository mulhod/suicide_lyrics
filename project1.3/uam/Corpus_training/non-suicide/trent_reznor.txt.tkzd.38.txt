#my violent heart

you and i , we may look the same , but we are very far apart .`
there 's bullet holes where my compassion used to be , and there is violence in my heart .
into fire you can send us .
from the fire we return .
you can label us a consequence of how much you have to learn .
you can try but , you 'll never understand .
this is something you will never understand .
can you hear it now ?
hear it coming now .
can you hear it now ?
on hands and knees , we crawl .
you can not stop us all .
our bones , our skin .
we will not let you in .
you have set something in motion , now .
much greater than you 've ever known .
standing there in all your grand naivety , about to reap what you have sown .
time will feed upon your weaknesses , and soon you 'll lose the will to care .
when you return to the place that you call home , we will be there .
we will be there .
on hands and knees , we crawl .
you can not stop us all .
our blood will stain .
we will not go away .
on hands and knees , we crawl .
you can not stop us all .
our blood , our ways will never leave this place .
