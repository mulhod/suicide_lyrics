#five feet high and rising

my mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our faith in the lord .
we could n't see much good in the flood waters when they were causing us to have to leave home , but when the water went down , we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land .
the following year we had the best cotton crop we 'd ever had .
i remember hearing : how high 's the water , mama ?
two feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , papa ?
two feet high and rising .
we can make it to the road in a homemade boat ?
that 's the only thing we got left that 'll float .
it 's already over all the wheat and the oats , two feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , mama ?
three feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , papa ?
three feet high and rising .
well , the hives are goneg .
i 've lost my bees .
the chickens are sleeping in the willow trees .
cow 's in water up past her knees .
three feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , mama ?
four feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , papa ?
four feet high and rising .
hey , come look through the window pane .
the bus is coming .
going to take us to the train .
looks like we 'll be blessed with a little more rain , four feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , mama ?
five feet high and rising .
how high 's the water , papa ?
five feet high and rising .
well , the rails are washed out north of town .
we got to head for higher ground .
we ca n't come back till the water comes down , five feet high and rising .
well , it 's five feet high and rising .
