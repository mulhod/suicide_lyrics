#cold feelings

uninvited feelings , they come without warning and they stay too long .
i do n't want to feel , and if i run they 'll be just as strong .
i 've been a-waiting , i 'm waiting for some kind of sign .
i try to separate , try to separate my body from my mind .
i watch the clock as the second hand slowly goes strolling by .
i do n't want to feel , when a loved one 's time 's come to die .
i 've been a-waiting , i 'm waiting for some kind of a sign .
i try to separate , try to separate my body from my mind .
cold feelings in the night .
you know , this feeling just be not right .
and though i try i just ca n't hide .
cold feelings in the night .
look out !
yeah i got faith , but sometimes fear it just weighs too much .
i do n't want to feel , cold winds blowing through me like an empty touch .
i 've been a-waiting , i 'm waiting for some kind of sign .
i try to separate , try to separate my body from my mind .
cold feelings in the night .
you know , this feeling just be not right .
and though i try i just ca n't hide .
cold feelings in the night .
cold feelings in the night .
cold feelings in the night .
cold feelings in the night .
