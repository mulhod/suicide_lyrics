#as i went out one morning

as i went out one morning to breathe the air around tom paine 's , i spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains .
i offered her my hand .
she took me by the arm .
i knew that very instant she meant to do me harm .
"depart from me this moment , " i told her with my voice .
said she , " but i do n't wish to . "
said i , " but you have no choice . "
"i beg you , sir , " she pleaded from the corners of her mouth .
"i will secretly accept you and together we 'll fly south . "
just then tom paine himself came running from across the field , shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield .
and , as she was letting go her grip , up tom paine did run .
"i 'm sorry , sir , " he said to me .
"i 'm sorry for what she 's done . "
