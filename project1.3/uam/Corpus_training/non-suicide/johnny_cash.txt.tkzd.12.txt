#get rhythm

hey , get rhythm when you get the blues .
come on , get rhythm when you get the blues .
get a rock-n-roll feeling in your bones .
put taps on your toes and get gone .
get rhythm when you get the blues .
a little shoeshine boy never gets low down , but he 's got the dirtiest job in town .
bending low at the people 's feet on the windy corner of the dirty street .
well , i asked him while he shined my shoes how 'd he keep from getting the blues .
he grinned as he raised his little head popped a shoeshine rag and then he said : get rhythm when you get the blues .
come on , get rhythm when you get the blues .
a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine .
it 'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind .
get rhythm when you get the blues .
get rhythm when you get the blues .
come on , get rhythm when you get the blues .
get a rock-n-roll feeling in your bones .
put taps on your toes and get gone .
get rhythm when you get the blues .
well , i sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy , and i thought i was going to jump for joy .
slapped on the shoe polish left and right .
he took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight .
he stopped once to wipe the sweat away .
i said you 're a mighty little boy to be working that way .
he said i like it with a big wide grin .
kept on popping and he said again : get rhythm when you get the blues .
come on , get rhythm when you get the blues .
it only costs a dime , just a nickel a shoe .
does a million dollars worth of good for you .
get rhythm when you get the blues .
