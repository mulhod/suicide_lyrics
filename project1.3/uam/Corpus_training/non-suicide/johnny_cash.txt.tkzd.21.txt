# who 's gene autry

whoopi tai ai oh , rocking to and fro , back in the saddle again .
my little boy said , "daddy , who 's gene autry ? "
his old movie was coming on tv , and i said , "let me tell you about him , son , " and i took him upon my knee .
why , when i was a little boy about your size and just about every saturday night when i could scrape up a dime for the movies and when my daddy said alright , i 'd be right downtown at the picture show like everybody else that could to see a handsome man on a big fine stallion going about , doing good .
singing : rocking to and fro .
put him back in the saddle again .
let him go on his way .
back in the saddle again .
well , he could ride his horse and play his guitar and sing all at the same time .
and i was riding right along there beside him on that broomstick pony of mine .
and you know his pistol never ran out of bullets when the bad guys had to be stopped .
and somehow his bullets never drew any blood but the bad guys dropped when he shot .
yeah , old gene was an image of justice and goodness and purity .
and in the eyes of a poor , little country boy he made the world look better to me .
singing : rocking to and fro .
put him back in the saddle again .
let him go on his way .
back in the saddle again .
and you know the way he rescued the rancher 's daughter , he 'd sent a thrill right up the aisle .
and the ending would always send us home with a good victorious smile .
now you ask me : who 's gene autry ?
well , son , go ahead and watch the show .
and then ride off into the sunset with him like i did forty years ago .
singing : rocking to and fro .
put him back in the saddle again .
let him go on his way .
back in the saddle again .
