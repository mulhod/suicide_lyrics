#boots of spanish leather

"oh , i 'm sailing away , my own true love .
i 'm sailing away in the morning .
is there something i can send you from across the sea from the place that i 'll be landing ? "
"no , there 's nothing you can send me , my own true love .
there 's nothing i 'm wishing to be owning .
just carry yourself back to me unspoiled from across that lonesome ocean . "
" ah , but i just thought you might want something fine , made of silver or of golden , either from the mountains of madrid or from the coast of barcelona . "
"well , if i had the stars of the darkest night and the diamonds from the deepest ocean , i 'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss for that 's all i 'm wishing to be owning . "
" that i might be gone a long , old time and it 's only that i 'm asking , is there something i can send you to remember me by to make your time more easy passing ? "
"oh , how can , how can you ask me again ?
it only brings me sorrow .
the same thing i would want today i would want again tomorrow . "
oh , i got a letter on a lonesome day .
it was from her ship sailing , saying , "i do n't know when i 'll be coming back again .
it depends on how i 'm feeling . "
"if you , my love , must think that way , i 'm sure your mind is roaming .
i 'm sure your thoughts are not with me , but with the country to where you 're going .
" so , take heed , take heed of the western winds .
take heed of the stormy weather .
and , yes , there 's something you can send back to me , spanish boots of spanish leather . "
