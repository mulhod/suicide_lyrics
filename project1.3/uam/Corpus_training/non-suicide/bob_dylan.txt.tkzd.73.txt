#country pie

just like old saxophone joe when he 's got the hogshead up on his toe , oh me , oh my , love that country pie !
listen to the fiddler play when he 's playing till the break of day .
oh me , oh my , love that country pie !
raspberry , strawberry , lemon , and lime .
what do i care ?
blueberry , apple , cherry , pumpkin , and plum .
call me for dinner .
honey , i 'll be there .
saddle me up my big , white goose .
tie me on her and turn her loose .
oh me , oh my , love that country pie !
i do n't need much .
that be not no lie .
be not running any race .
give to me my country pie , i wo n't throw it up in anybody 's face .
shake me up that old peach tree .
little jack horner got nothing on me .
oh me , oh my , love that country pie !
