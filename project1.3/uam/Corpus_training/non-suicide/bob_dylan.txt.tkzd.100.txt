#wedding song

i love you more than ever , more than time and more than love .
i love you more than money and more than the stars above .
love you more than madness , more than dreams upon the sea .
i love you more than life itself .
you mean that much to me .
ever since you walked right in , the circle 's been complete .
i say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street , to the courtyards of the jester , which is hidden from the sun .
i love you more than ever and i have n't yet begun .
you breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live .
when i was deep in poverty , you taught me how to give , dried the tears up from my dreams , and pulled me
from the hole .
i love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul .
you gave me babies , one , two , three .
what is more ?
you saved my life .
eye for eye and tooth for tooth , your love cuts like a knife .
my thoughts of you do n't ever rest .
they 'd kill me if i lie .
but i 'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die .
the tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth , we 'll play it out the best we know , whatever it is worth .
what 's lost is lost .
we ca n't regain what went down in the flood , but happiness to me is you and i love you more than blood .
it 's never been my duty to remake the world at large nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge because i love you more than all of that with a love that does n't bend and , if there is eternity , i 'll love you there again .
oh , ca n't you see that you were born to stand by my side and i was born to be with you , you were born to be my bride ?
you 're the other half of what i am .
you 're the missing piece and i love you more than ever with that love that does n't cease .
you turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see .
just being next to you is a natural thing for me and i could never let you go , no matter what goes on because i love you more than ever now that the past is gone .
