# to your love

here 's another speech you wish i 'd swallow .
another cue for you to fold your ears .
another train of thought too hard to follow , chugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gears .
please forgive me for my distance .
the pain is the evident in my existence .
please forgive me for my distance .
the shame is manifest in my resistance to your love , to your love , to your love .
i would 've warned you , but really , what 's the point ?
caution could , but rarely ever helps .
do n't be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint .
it 's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself .
please forgive me for my distance .
the pain is evident in my existence .
please forgive me for my distance .
the shame is manifest in my resistance to your love , to your love , to your love .
my derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you , but by the time i 'm close to you , i lose my desideratum and now you , so now you have it .
so baby tell me what 's the word ?
am i your gal , or should i get out of town ?
i just need to be reassured .
do you just deal it out , or can you deal with what i lay down ?
please forgive me , for my distance .
the pain is evident in my existence .
please forgive me for my distance .
the shame is manifest in my resistance to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love .
