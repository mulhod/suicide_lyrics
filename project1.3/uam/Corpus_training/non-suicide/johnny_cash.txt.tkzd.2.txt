#there you go

you 're going to break another heart .
you 're going to tell another lie .
well here i am , and there you go ; you 're gone again .
i know you 're going to be the way you 've always been .
breaking hearts and telling lies is all you know .
another guy gives you the eye , and there you go .
there you go .
you 're gone again .
i should have known , i could n't win .
there you go .
you 're by his side .
you 're going to break another heart .
you 're going to tell another lie .
because i love you so i take much more than i should take .
i want you even though i know my heart is going to break .
you build me up , and for a while i 'm all a-glow then your fickle heart sees someone else , and there you go .
thre you go .
you 're gone again .
i should have known , i could n't win .
there you go .
you 're by his side .
you 're going to break another heart .
you 're going to tell another lie .
