#tears in the holston river

on october twenty third , nineteen seventy eight , i lost a loved one and i confess i cried in the joyous celebration of the lady and her music .
there were tears in the holston river when maybelle carter died .
then walking down that river road i saw crystal tear-shaped droplets , silver beads of love sparkling on the river side .
and i 'll just bet they turn to diamonds , for the love that was behind them .
there were tears in the holston river when mother maybelle died .
then on january eighth , nineteen-seventy-nine , we lost sara carter , and the pain was multiplied .
down below that old clinch mountain , we laid her at mount vernon .
there were tears in the holston river when sara carter died .
then walking down that river road i saw crystal tear-shaped droplets , silver beads of love sparkling in the riverside .
and i 'll just bet they turn to diamonds , for the love that was behind them .
there were tears in the holston river when maybelle & sara died .
there were tears in the holston river when mother maybelle and sara carter died .
