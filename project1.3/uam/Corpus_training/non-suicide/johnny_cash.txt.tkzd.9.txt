#hey porter

hey porter !
hey porter !
would you tell me the time ?
how much longer will it be till we cross that mason dixon line ?
at daylight would you tell that engineer to slow it down , or better still , just stop the train , because i want to look around .
hey porter !
hey porter !
what time did you say ?
how much longer will it be till i can see the light of day ?
when we hit dixie will you tell that engineer to ring his bell and ask everybody that be not asleep to stand right up and yell .
hey porter !
hey porter !
it 's getting light outside .
this old train is puffing smoke , and i have to strain my eyes .
but ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please , because i smell frost on cotton leaves and i feel that southern breeze .
hey porter !
hey porter !
please get my bags for me .
i need nobody to tell me now that we 're in tennessee .
go tell that engineer to make that lonesome whistle scream .
we 're not so far from home so take it easy on the steam .
hey porter !
hey porter !
please open up the door when they stop the train .
i 'm going to get off first because i ca n't wait no more .
tell that engineer i said thanks a lot , and i did n't mind the fare .
i 'm going to set my feet on southern soil and breathe that southern air .
