#drug train

it 'll take you as high as the heavens .
it 'll take you to the depths of hell .
it 'll make you friends , it 'll take your friends who will never live to tell .
drug train , drug train .
drug train , drug train .
the traing . first stop is pleasure .
the scond stop is fun .
but in a jail cell , baby , in a hospital bed , you 'll need hope , because you
be not got none .
drug train , drug train .
drug train , drug train .
the train passes through the graveyard .
may the loved ones rest in peace .
for the last stop baby is a violent crash and hard times they never cease .
drug train , drug train .
drug train , drug train .
