#do n't take your guns to town

a young cowboy named billy joe grew restless on the farm .
a boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm .
he changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair down , and his mother cried as he walked out : do n't take your guns to town , son .
leave your guns at home bill .
do n't take your guns to town .
he laughed and kissed his mom and said your billy joe 's a man .
i can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can , but i would n't shoot without a cause , i 'd gun nobody down , but she cried again as he rode away : do n't take your guns to town son .
leave your guns at home bill .
do n't take your guns to town .
he sang a song as on he rode , his guns hung at his hips .
he rode into a cattle town , a smile upon his lips .
he stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down .
but his mother 's words echoed again : do n't take your guns to town son .
leave your guns at home bill .
do n't take your guns to town .
he drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand and tried to tell himself at last he had become a man .
a dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down , and he heard again his mothers words : do n't take your guns to town son .
leave your guns at home bill .
do n't take your guns to town .
filled with rage then billy joe reached for his gun to draw , but the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw .
as billy joe fell to the floor , the crowd all gathered around , and wondered at his final words : do n't take your guns to town son .
leave your guns at home bill .
do n't take your guns to town .
