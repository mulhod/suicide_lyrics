# when angels sing

at last we meet again , dear god , hear the angels sing .
the funerals are nicer when we know you 're there , when the angels sing .
sometimes i try so hard to understand the things you do .
i like to question you when it all comes down , hear the angels sing .
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angels sing .
love and death do n't mean a thing till the angels sing .
the prisoners pray when they 're on to death row , when the angels sing .
the junky cries for love but it 's all run out , when the angels sing .
the sins of the world .
and it 's cold on the streets and you 're all alone and the tears they start to fall when it all comes down , hear the angels sing .
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angels sing .
love and death do n't mean a thing , till the angels sing .
little by little , day by day , i watch the children play .
cause life and death do n't mean a thing , till the angels sing .
when the angel of death comes to looking for me , hear the angels sing .
i hope i was everything i was supposed to be , when the angels sing .
there 's got to be a heaven cause i 've already done my time in hell .
and a little , baby 's born , when it all comes down , hear the angels sing .
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angels sing .
love and death do n't mean a thing , till the angels sing .
little by little , day by day , i watch the children play because life and death do n't mean a thing till the angels sing .
