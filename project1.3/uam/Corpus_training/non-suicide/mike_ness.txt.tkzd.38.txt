#down on the world again

this be not the way it 's supposed to be , there 's a dark cloud following me .
i 'm disillusioned and i 'm down on the world again .
there 's movies going on in my head and all i can see is the color red .
i 'm relentless and i 'm down on the world again .
give me tomorrow 's broken dreams now .
i 'm feeling like a loaded gun .
there 's a world of guilt written on my face , and i feel ashamed for the human race .
i 've been forsaken , and i 'm down on the world again .
well , i feel so alone in this crowd .
my thoughts of despair are getting loud .
i 'm disrespected and i 'm down on the world again .
love and tolerance have abandoned me , and i feel the gloom hovering over me .
i 'm resentful , and i 'm down on the world again .
give me tomorrow 's broken dreams now .
i 'm feeling like a loaded gun .
give me tomorrow 's holy schemes now , so hopeless when there 's no place left to run .
well , i tried to play for the higher stakes .
you wo n't let me forget my mistakes .
i 'm unforgiven , and i 'm down on the world again .
this be not the way it 's supposed to be .
there 's a dark cloud following me .
i 'm distorted , and i 'm down on the world again .
