#still alive

well , i remember when we were young and you said that i was done .
well , i walked the long boulevard my head hanging down .
and the word out on the street i was back up on my feet ;
i was fighting the same old wars had to even up the scores .
and i 'm still alive , and i will survive .
i can take what life 's got to give just need a little time .
and i 'm still alive , talking that some ol ' jive .
i can handle what comes my way , just gimme another day .
and the times have changed my friend .
i 'll be here to the bitter end .
with a guitar in my hand , i stand a little taller .
and i 've been to hell and back ,
i be not falling off this track .
from the back to the front page , from the gutter to the stage .
and i 'm still alive and i will survive .
i can take what life 's got to give just need a little time .
and i 'm still alive , talking that some ol ' jive .
i can handle what comes my way just gimme another day .
and from town to town i roam , take me so very far from home .
and i woke up one summer day and i fell in love .
and the times have changed , my friend .
i 'll be here to the bitter end .
and i 'm here to make my stand .
with a guitar in my hand .
and i 'm still alive and i will survive .
i can take what life 's got to give just need a little time .
and i 'm still alive , talking that some ol ' jive .
i can handle what comes my way just gimme another day , another day .
