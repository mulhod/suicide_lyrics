#understand your man

don’t call my name out your window , i’m leaving .
i won’t even turn my head .
don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking .
i’ll be gone , like i said .
you’d just say the same old things that you be sayingall along .
just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till i’m gone .
don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan .
understand your man .
i 'm tired of your bad mouthing .
understand your man .
now , you can give my other suit to the salvation army , and everything else i leave behind .
i be not taking nothing that 'll slow down my traveling , while i 'm untangling my mind .
i be not going to repeat what i said anymore , while i 'm breathing air that be not been breathed before .
i 'll be as gone as the wild gruesome winter , then you 'll understand your man .
meditate on it .
you hear me talking now .
understand your man .
remember what i told you .
understand your man .
