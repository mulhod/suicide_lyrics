#one of us must know ( sooner or later )

i did n't mean to treat you so bad .
you should n't take it so personal .
i did n't mean to make you so sad .
you just happened to be there .
that 's all .
when i saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile , i thought that it was well understood that you 'd be coming back in a little while .
i did n't know that you were saying goodbye for good .
but sooner or later one of us must know that you just did what you 're supposed to do .
sooner or later one of us must know that i really did try to get close to you .
i could n't see what you could show me .
your scarf , it kept your mouth well hid .
i could n't see how you could know me , but you said you knew me and i believed you did .
when you whispered in my ear and asked me if i was leaving with you or her , i did n't realize just what i did hear , i did n't realize how young you were .
but sooner or later one of us must know that you 're just doing what you 're supposed to do .
sooner or later one of us must know that i really did try to get close to you .
i could n't see when it started snowing .
your voice was all that i heard .
i could n't see where we were going , but you said you knew and i took your word .
and then you told me later as i apologized that you were just kidding me , you were n't really from the farm .
and i told you as you clawed out my eyes that i never really meant to do you any harm .
but sooner or later one of us must know that you just did what you 're supposed to do .
sooner or later one of us must know that i really did try to get close to you .
