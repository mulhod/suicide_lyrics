#all along the watchtower

" there must be some way out of here , " said the joker to the thief .
" there 's too much confusion .
i ca n't get no relief .
businessmen , they drink my wine .
plowmen dig my earth .
none of them along the line know what any of it is worth . "
" no reason to get excited , " the thief , he kindly spoke .
" there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke , but you and i , we 've been through that and this is not our fate , so let us not talk falsely now .
the hour is getting late . "
all along the watchtower princes kept the view while all the women came and went , barefoot servants , too .
outside in the distance a wildcat did growl .
two riders were approaching .
the wind began to howl .
