#i will rock and roll with you

they used to call me rockabilly .
all of us ran through when elvis opened up the door with a pup-and-pup-and-boo .
i did n't ever play much rock and roll because i got so much country in my soul .
but i 'm a different man for loving you , and i take a shot at what you ask me to .
and baby i will rock and roll with you if i have to .
memphis 1955 on newton avenue carl and jerry and charlie and roy and billy riley too .
a new sun rising on the way we sing and a world of weirdos waiting in the wings .
but i love you , and though i 'm past 42 , there are still a few things yet i did n't do .
and baby i will rock and roll with you if i have to .
