#you're going to make me lonesome when you go

i 've seen love go by my door .
it 's never been this close before .
never been so easy or so slow .
i been shooting in the dark too long .
when something 's not right , it 's wrong .
you 're going to make me lonesome when you go .
dragon clouds so high above , i 've only known careless love .
it always has hit me from below , but this time around it 's more correct , right on target , so direct .
you 're going to make me lonesome when you go .
purple clover , queen anne lace , crimson hair across your face , you could make me cry if you do n't know .
ca n't remember what i was thinking of .
you might be spoiling me too much , love .
you 're going to make me lonesome when you go .
flowers on the hillside blooming crazy , crickets talking back and forth in rhyme , blue river running slow and lazy , i could stay with you forever and never realize the time .
situations have ended sad .
relationships have all been bad .
mine 've been like verlaine 's and rimbaud 's , but there 's no way i can compare all them scenes to this affair .
you 're going to make me lonesome when you go .
you 're going to make me wonder what i 'm doing , staying far behind without you .
you 're going to make me wonder what i 'm saying .
you 're going to make me give myself a good talking-to .
i 'll look for you in old honolulu , san francisco , or ashtabula .
you 're going to have to leave me now , i know .
but i 'll see you in the sky above , in the tall grass , in the ones i love .
you 're going to make me lonesome when you go .
