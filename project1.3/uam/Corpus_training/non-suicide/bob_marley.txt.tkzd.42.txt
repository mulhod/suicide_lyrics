#time will tell

jah would never give the power to a baldhead .
run come crucify the dread .
time alone , oh , time will tell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
time alone , oh , time will tell .
you think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
back them up ; oh , not the brothers , but the ones who sets them up .
time alone , oh , time will tell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
time alone , oh , time will tell .
you think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
oh , my , oh , my , oh , my children are crying .
oh , children , weep no more !
oh , my sycamore tree , saw the freedom tree .
all you have spoke .
oh , children , weep no more .
weep no more children .
weep no more !
jah would never give the power to a baldhead .
run come crucify the dread .
time alone , oh , time will tell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
time alone , oh , time will tell .
think you 're in heaven , but you living in hell .
