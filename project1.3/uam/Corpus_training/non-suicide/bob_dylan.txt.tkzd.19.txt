# just like a woman

nobody feels any pain tonight as i stand inside the rain .
everybody knows that baby 's got new clothes , but lately i see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls .
she takes just like a woman .
yes , she does !
she makes love just like a woman .
yes , she does !
and she aches just like a woman , but she breaks just like a little girl .
queen mary , she 's my friend .
yes , i believe i 'll go see her again .
nobody has to guess that baby ca n't be blessed till she finally sees that she 's like all the rest with her fog , her amphetamine , and her pearls .
she takes just like a woman , yes !
she makes love just like a woman .
yes , she does !
and she aches just like a woman , but she breaks just like a little girl .
it was raining from the first and i was dying of thirst , so i came in here .
and your long-time curse hurts , but what 's worse is this pain in here .
i ca n't stay in here .
be not it clear that i just ca n't fit ?
yes , i believe it 's time for us to quit .
and , when we meet again , introduced as friends , please do n't let on that you knew me when i was hungry and it was your world .
ah , you fake just like a woman .
yes , you do !
you make love just like a woman .
yes , you do !
then you ache just like a woman , but you break just like a little girl .
