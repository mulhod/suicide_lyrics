#sometimes i do

sometimes i like you and sometimes i do n't , i feel like i 'm going to and then i wo n't .
sometimes i want to live to see a hundred , other times i want to lay down and die .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i 'm weak and sometimes i 'm strong .
you know that i 've loved all along .
sometimes i 'm rich and sometimes i 'm poor .
nothing really matters when you 're dead on the floor .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i 'm hot , and sometimes i 'm cold .
other times i feel like i 'm getting old .
sometimes i 'm fast , and sometimes i 'm slow .
other times i do n't even want to go .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i laugh , and sometimes i cry .
other times i sit and wonder why .
sometimes i 'm up , and sometimes i 'm down .
other times i want to blow this town .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
sometimes i do and sometimes i do n't .
