#bad luck

some people like to gamble , but you , you always lose .
some people like to rock 'n' roll ; you 're always singing the blues .
you got to nasty disposition , no one really knows the reason why .
you got to bad , bad reputation .
going to hang your head down and cry .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
thirteen 's my lucky number , to you it means stay inside .
black cat done crossed my path , no reason to run and hide .
you 're looking through a cracked mirror , no one really knows the reason why .
your enemies are getting nearer .
going to hang down your head and cry .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
some people go to church on sundays , others they pray at home .
you tell them that there be not no god , that they 're better off standing alone .
you 're always scratching at the eight ball , no one really knows the reason why .
you get to the top and then you fall .
going to hang down your head and cry .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
do n't give it to me .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
