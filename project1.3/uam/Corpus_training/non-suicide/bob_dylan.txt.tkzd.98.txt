#you angel you

you angel , you , you got me under your wing .
the way you walk and the way you talk i feel i could almost sing .
you angel , you , you 're as fine as anything 's fine .
i just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind .
and , though i ca n't sleep at night for trying , yes , i never did feel this way before , never did get up and walk the floor .
if this is love , then give me more and more and more and more and more .
you angel , you , you 're as fine as can be .
the way you walk and the way you talk is the way it ought to be .
and , though i ca n't sleep at night for trying , never did feel this way before , never did get up and walk the floor .
if this is love , then give me more and more and more and more .
you angel , you , you got me under your wing .
the way you walk and the way you talk , i swear , it would make me sing .
