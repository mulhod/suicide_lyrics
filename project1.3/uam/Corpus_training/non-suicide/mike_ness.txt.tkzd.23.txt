#it could 've been me

i got friends who are in prison , friends who are dead .
i 'm going to tell ya something that i 've often said .
you know these things that happen , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it could 've been me .
i had me a good girl , her kisses sweeter than wine .
and i had always hoped that someday i 'd make her mine .
but she ran off and married , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it could 've been me .
well the junkie cops on first street , sticks a needle in his arm .
no , he never meant to do anyone no harm .
but he 's buried six feet deep , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it could 've been me .
i had me a good girl , her kisses sweeter than wine .
and i had always hoped that someday i 'd make her mine .
bus she ran off and married , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't you know it could 've been me .
could 've been me , could 've been me , could been me , could 've been me , could 've been me ,
could 've been me , could 've been me , could 've been me .
could 've been , should 've been me .
