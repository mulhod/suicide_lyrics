#red red red

i do n't understand about complementary colors and what they say .
side by side they both get bright .
together they both get gray .
but he 's been pretty much yellow , and i 've been kinda blue , but all i can see is red , red , red , red , red now .
what am i going to do ?
i do n't understand about diamonds and why men buy them .
what 's so impressive about a diamond except the mining ?
and it 's dangerous work trying to get to you too .
and i think if i did n't have to kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill myself doing it maybe i would n't think so much of you .
i 've been watching all the time , and i still ca n't find the tack .
and i want to know : is it okay ?
is it just fine ?
or is it my fault ?
is it my lack ?
i do n't understand about the weather outside , or the harmony in a tune , or why somebody lied .
there 's solace a bit for submitting to the fitfully cryptically true .
what 's happened has happened .
what 's coming is already on its way with a role for me to play .
i do n't understand .
i 'll never understand , but i 'll try to understand .
there 's nothing else i can do .
