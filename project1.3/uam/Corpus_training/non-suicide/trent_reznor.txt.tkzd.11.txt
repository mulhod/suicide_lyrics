#something i can never have

i still recall the taste of my tears .
echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears .
my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore .
scraping through my head 'till i do n't want to sleep anymore .
you make this all go away .
you make this all go away .
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm starting to scare myself .
you make this all go away .
you make it all go away .
i just want something .
i just want something i can never have .
you always were the one to show me how .
back then i could n't do the things that i can do now .
this thing is slowly take me apart .
grey would be the color if i had a heart .
come on , tell me .
you make this all go away .
you make this all go away .
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm starting to scare myself .
you make this all go away .
you make it all go away .
i just want something .
i just want something i can never have .
in this place it seems like such a same .
though it all looks different now , i know it 's still the same .
everywhere i look you 're all i see .
just a fading , fucking reminder of who i used to be .
you make this all go away .
you make this all go away .
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm starting to scare myself .
you make this all go away .
you make it all go away .
i just want something .
i just want something i can never have .
i just want something i can never have .
