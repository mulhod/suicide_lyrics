#lily , rosemary and the jack of hearts

the festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall .
the cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall .
the curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down .
anyone with any sense had already left town .
he was standing in the doorway , looking like the jack of hearts .
he moved across the mirrored room .
" set it up for everyone , " he said .
then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads .
and he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin , " could you kindly tell me , friend , what time the show begins ? "
then he moved into the corner , face down like the jack of hearts .
backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs .
lily had two queens .
she was hoping for a third to match her pair .
outside the streets were filling up .
the window was open wide .
a gentle breeze was blowing .
you could feel it from inside .
lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts .
big jim was no one 's fool .
he owned the town 's only diamond mine .
he made his usual entrance , looking so dandy and so fine .
with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place , he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste , but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts .
rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town .
she slipped in through the side door , looking like a queen without a crown .
she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear , " sorry , darling , that i 'm late , " but he did n't seem to hear .
he was staring into space over at the jack of hearts .
i know i 've seen that face somewhere , big jim was thinking to himself .
maybe down in mexico or a picture upon somebody 's shelf .
but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him , staring at the butterfly , who just drew the jack of hearts .
lily was a princess .
she was fair-skinned and precious as a child .
she did whatever she had to do .
she had that certain flash every time she smiled .
she had come away from a broken home , had lots of strange affairs with men in every walk of life , which took her everywhere , but she 'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts .
the hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined .
the drilling in the wall kept up , but no one seemed to pay it any mind .
it was known all around that lily had jim 's ring and nothing would ever come between lily and the king .
no , nothing ever would , except maybe the jack of hearts .
rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife .
she was tired of the attention , tired of playing the role of big jim 's wife .
she had done a lot of bad things , even once tried suicide , was looking to do just one good deed before she died .
she was gazing to the future , riding on the jack of hearts .
lily took her dress off , buried it away .
"has your luck run out ? " she laughed at him .
"well , i guess you must 've known it would some day .
be careful not to touch the wall .
there 's a brand-new coat of paint .
i 'm glad to see you 're still alive .
you 're looking like a saint . "
down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts .
the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair .
" there 's something funny going on , " he said .
"i can just feel it in the air . "
he went to get the hanging judge , but the hanging judge was drunk as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk .
there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts .
no one knew the circumstance , but they say that it happened pretty quick .
the door to the dressing room burst open and a colt revolver clicked .
and big jim was standing there ï¿½ you could n't say surprised , rosemary right beside him , steady in her eyes .
she was with big jim , but she was leaning to the jack of hearts .
two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall and cleaned out the bank safe .
it 's said they got off with quite a haul .
in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground for one more member , who had business back in town , for they could n't go no further without the jack of hearts .
the next day was hanging day .
the sky was overcast and black .
big jim lay covered up , killed by a penknife in the back .
and rosemary on the gallows , she did n't even blink .
the hanging judge was sober .
he had n't had a drink .
the only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts .
the cabaret was empty now .
a sign said " closed for repair " .
lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair .
she was thinking about her father , who she very rarely saw , thinking about rosemary and thinking about the law , but most of all she was thinking about the jack of hearts .
