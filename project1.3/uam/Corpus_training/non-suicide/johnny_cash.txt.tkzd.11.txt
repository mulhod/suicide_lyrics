#luther played the boogie

we were just a plain old hillbilly band with a plain old country style .
we never played the kind of songs that 'd drive anybody wild .
played a railroad song with a stomping beat .
we played a blues song kind of slow and sweet , but the thing that knocked them off of their feet was , ooh wee , when luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie in a strangest kind of way .
play it strange .
well , we did our best to entertain .
everywhere we 'd go , we 'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show .
played jumping jive to make them get in the groove .
we played sad songs real slow and smooth , but the only thing that 'd make them move was , ooh wee , when luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie-woogie .
luther played the boogie in a strangest kind of way .
now did n't luther play the boogie strange ?
