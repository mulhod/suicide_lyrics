#cry , cry , cry

everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down .
i think you only live to see the lights of town .
i wasted my time when i would try , try , try .
when the lights have lost their glow , you 're going to cry , cry , cry .
soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone .
you 'll wake up some cold day and find you 're alone .
you 'll call to me but i 'm going to tell you : "bye , bye , bye . "
when i turn around and walk away , you 'll cry , cry , cry ,
you 're going to cry , cry , cry , and you 'll cry alone .
when everyone 's forgotten and you 're left on your own , you 're going to cry , cry , cry .
i lie awake at night to wait till you come in .
you stay a little while and then you 're gone again .
every question that i ask , i get a lie , lie , lie .
for every lie you tell , you 're going to cry , cry , cry .
when your fickle little love gets old , no one will care for you .
you 'll come back to me for a little love that 's true .
i 'll tell you no and you going to ask me why , why , why ?
when i remind you of all of this , you 'll cry , cry , cry .
you 're going to cry , cry , cry , and you 'll want me there .
it 'll hurt when you think of the fool you 've been .
you 're going to cry , cry , cry .
