walk the line

i keep a close watch on this heart of mine .
i keep my eyes wide open all the time .
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds .
because you 're mine , i walk the line .
i find it very , very easy to be true .
i find myself alone when each day is through .
yes , i 'll admit that i 'm a fool for you .
because you 're mine , i walk the line .
as sure as night is dark and day is light i keep you on my mind both day and night , and happiness i 've known proves that it 's right .
because you 're mine , i walk the line .
you 've got a way to keep me on your side .
you give me cause for love that i ca n't hide .
for you i know i 'd even try to turn the tide .
because you 're mine , i walk the line .
i keep a close watch on this heart of mine .
i keep my eyes wide open all the time .
i keep the ends out for the tie that binds .
because you 're mine , i walk the line .
