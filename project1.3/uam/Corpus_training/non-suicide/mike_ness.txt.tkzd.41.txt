#pleasure seeker

well , here i come .
i 'm on a run .
who wants to fight temptation , that 's no fun .
c 'mon and play the games .
do n't you feel no shame .
that 's what eve said to adam before she came .
you can smile now , cry later on .
you know that it might be wrong , but it feels so good , like you knew it would .
there 's damnation and disgrace .
and guilt rears its ugly face , yet you beg for more , just a little more .
stand in line .
do n't you lose your mind .
try like me to seek your pleasure , three at a time .
there 's souls for sale .
you 're going to burn in hell .
and if tomorrow never comes , it 's just as well .
you can smile now , cry later on .
you know that it must be wrong , but it feels so good , like you knew it would .
there 's damnation and disgrace .
and guilt rears its ugly face , yet you beg for more , just a little more .
uah .
feel the pain .
i feel it too .
have your hedonistic ways , got the best of you ?
playing the games .
do n't feel no shame .
that 's what eve said to adam before she came
you can smile now , cry later on .
you know that it 's definitely wrong , but it feels so good , like you know it would .
there 's damnation and disgrace .
and guilt rears its ugly face , yet you beg for more , just a little more .
come on and beg for more , just a little more .
