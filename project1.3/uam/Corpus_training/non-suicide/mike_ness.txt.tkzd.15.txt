#faithless

i know a girl who warns of the dangers of love , all the pain and the anguish , the sorrow that it brings .
she keeps herself in a world that 's protected .
her outsides are tough , but inside her heart longs to sing .
do n't let your walls down , you might fall in love , you might fall in love .
he 's going to get his girlfriend 's name tattooed on his neck and hope he never , never lives to regret .
he 's going to walk down that long , dark alley and what he finds there you know he 'll never forget .
do n't let your walls down , you might fall in love , you might fall in love .
they 're crashing down now .
you might fall in love .
i remember a time i believed that the words love and pain were both one in the same .
i 'm going to trade in my old ways for a new shot at life .
i 'm going to change , change my direction .
i 'm going to change my ways .
do n't let your walls down , you might fall in love , you might fall in love .
they 're crashing down now .
it 's you i 'm thinking of , it 's you i 'm thinking of .
let 's fall in love .
