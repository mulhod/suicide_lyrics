#so far away

i 've sung the blues , for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you .
i 've paid my dues , working hard-sweat , blood , and tears for you .
so far away , so far away , so far away !
so far away , so far away , so far away !
i 've had it all , and lost it all in one blackout summer night .
i want it back , but i just ca n't seem to get it right .
so far away , so far away , so far away !
so far away , so far away , so far away !
i 've sung the blues , for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you .
i 've paid my dues , working hard-sweat , blood and tears for you .
so far away , so far away , so far away !
so far away , so far away , so far away !
