#ballad in plain d

i once loved a girl .
her skin , it was bronze .
with the innocence of a lamb , she was gentle like a fawn .
i courted her proudly , but now she is gone , gone as the season she 's taken .
in a young summer 's youth , i stole her away from her mother and sister , though close did they stay .
each one of them suffering from the failures of their day , with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us .
of the two sisters , i loved the young .
with sensitive instincts , she was the creative one .
the constant scapegoat , she was easily undone by the jealousy of others around her .
for her parasite sister i had no respect .
bound by her boredom , her pride to protect , countless visions of the other she 'd reflect as a crutch for her scenes and her society .
myself , for what i did i cannot be excused .
the changes i was going through ca n't even be used for the lies that i told her in hope not to lose the could-be dream-lover of my lifetime .
with unseen consciousness i possessed in my grip a magnificent mantelpiece , though its heart being chipped , noticing not that i 'd already slipped to the sin of love 's false security .
from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace , answers of emptiness , voice vacancies , till the tombstones of damage read no questions but , "please , what 's wrong ?
what 's exactly the matter ? "
and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen , the timeless explosion of fantasy 's dream .
at the peak of the night the king and the queen tumbled all down into pieces .
" the tragic figure ! " her sister did shout .
"leave her alone .
goddamn you .
get out ! "
and i , in my armor , turning about and nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness .
beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound , her sister and i in a screaming battleground and she in between , the victim of sound , soon shattered as a child to the shadows .
" all is gone .
all is gone .
admit it .
take flight ! "
i gagged in contradiction , tears blinding my sight .
my mind , it was mangled .
i ran into the night , leaving all of love 's ashes behind me .
the wind knocks my window .
the room , it is wet .
the words to say "i 'm sorry " i have n't found yet .
i think of her often and hope whoever she 's met will be fully aware of how precious she is .
ah , my friends from the prison , they ask unto me , "how good , how good does it feel to be free ? "
and i answer them most mysteriously , "are birds free from the chains of the skyway ? "
