#it 's alright , ma ( i 'm only bleeding )

darkness at the break of noon shadows even the silver spoon .
the hand-made blade , the child 's balloon eclipses both the sun and moon .
to understand , you know too soon there 's no sense in trying .
pointed threats , they bluff with scorn .
suicide remarks are torn from the fool 's gold mouthpiece .
the hollow horn plays wasted words , proves to warn that he not busy being born is busy dying .
temptation 's page flies out the door .
you follow , find yourself at war , watch waterfalls of pity roar .
you feel to moan , but unlike before you discover that you 'd just be one more person crying .
so , do n't fear if you hear a foreign sound to your ear .
it 's alright , ma , i 'm only sighing .
as some warn victory , some downfall , private reasons , great or small , can be seen in the eyes of those that call to make all that should be killed to crawl while others say , "do n't hate nothing at all except hatred . "
disillusioned words like bullets bark as human gods aim for their mark , make everything from toy guns that spark to flesh-colored christs that glow in the dark .
it 's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred .
while preachers preach of evil fates , teachers teach that knowledge waits , can lead to hundred-dollar plates , goodness hides behind its gates , but even the president of the united states sometimes must have to stand naked .
and , though the rules of the road have been lodged , it 's only people 's games that you got to dodge and it 's alright , ma , i can make it .
advertising signs that con you into thinking you 're the one that can do what 's never been done , that can win what 's never been won .
meantime life outside goes on all around you .
you lose yourself .
you reappear .
you suddenly find you got nothing to fear .
alone you stand with nobody near when a trembling , distant voice , unclear , startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you .
a question in your nerves is lit , yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy , ensure you not to quit , to keep it in your mind and not forget that it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to .
but , though the masters make the rules for the wise men and the fools , i got nothing , ma , to live up to .
for them that must obey authority that they do not respect in any degree , who despise their jobs , their destinies , speak jealously of them that are free , do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in .
while some on principles baptized to strict party-platform ties , social clubs in drag disguise , outsiders they can freely criticize , tell nothing except who to idolize and say , "god bless him . "
while one who sings with his tongue on fire gargles in the rat-race choir , bent out of shape from society 's pliers , cares not to come up any higher , but rather get you down in the hole that he 's in .
but i mean no harm nor put fault on anyone that lives in a vault , but it 's alright , ma , if i ca n't please him .
old-lady judges watch people in pairs .
limited in sex they dare to push fake morals , insult , and stare while money does n't talk , it swears , obscenity � who really cares ? � propaganda all is phony .
while them that defend what they cannot see with a killer 's pride , security , it blows their minds most bitterly for them that think death 's honesty wo n't fall upon them naturally , life sometimes must get lonely .
my eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards , false goals .
i scuff at pettiness , which plays so rough , walk upside-down inside handcuffs , kick my legs to crash it off , say , "ok , i 've had enough , what else can you show me ? "
and , if my thought-dreams could be seen , they 'd probably put my head in a guillotine , but it 's alright , ma , it 's life and life only .
