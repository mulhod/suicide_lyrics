#riding high

you 've been riding .
you 've been riding quite a while , child .
keep on riding .
keep on riding .
you 've been jiving like a peacock .
that 's your style .
keep on jiving .
ooh , keep on jiving .
now i remember the days in school .
there was n't a time when you did n't treat me cruel .
ooh , wait till i get my hooks on you .
i 'll show you what a fisherman can do .
you 're riding .
been riding quite a while , child .
keep on riding .
keep on riding .
you 've been jiving like a peacock .
that 's your style .
keep on jiving .
ooh-wee , keep on jiving .
you always try to hurt me in the end , in the presence of all our good , good friends , but the patient man always win .
now i 'll just wait till you give in .
you 've been riding .
you 've been riding quite a while .
keep on riding .
keep on , ride .
keep on riding .
you 've been jiving like a peacock .
that 's your style .
keep on jiving .
ooh-wee , alright .
keep on jiving .
at christmas , more like an easter bunny .
just like a rabbit , you 're always on the run , but wait till i get my trap on you .
i 'll see where you going to run to .
wait till i get my trap on you , then i 'll see where you going to run to .
you 've been riding .
you 've been riding quite a while .
keep on riding .
keep on , ride .
keep on riding .
you 've been jiving like a peacock .
that 's your style .
keep on jiving .
ooh-wee , keep on jiving .
riding on my own .
i need your love tonight .
riding on my own .
when you hold me right .
