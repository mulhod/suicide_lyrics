#dead souls

someone take these dreams away that point me to another day .
a duel of personalities that stretch all true reality .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
when figures from the past stand tall , and mocking voices ring the hall .
imperialistic house of prayer .
conquistadors who took their share .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
calling me , calling me , calling me , calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
