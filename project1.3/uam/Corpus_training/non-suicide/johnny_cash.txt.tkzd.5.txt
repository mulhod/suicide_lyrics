#folsom prison blues

i hear the train coming .
it 's rolling around the bend .
and i be not seen the sunshine since i do n't know when .
i 'm stuck in folsom prison , and time keeps dragging on , but that train keeps rolling on down to san antone .
when i was just a baby , my mama told me , " son , always be a good boy , do n't ever play with guns , " but i shot a man in reno just to watch him die .
when i hear that whistle blowing , i hang my head and cry .
i bet there 's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car .
they 're probably drinking coffee , and smoking big cigars , but i know i had it coming .
i know i ca n't be free , but those people keep moving , and that 's what tortures me .
well , if they freed me from this prison , if that railroad train was mine , i bet i 'd move out over a little , farther down the line .
far from folsom prison , that 's where i want to stay , and i 'd let that lonesome whistle , blow my blues away .
