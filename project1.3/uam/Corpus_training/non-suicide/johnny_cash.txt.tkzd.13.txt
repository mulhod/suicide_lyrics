#give my love to rose

found him by the railroad track this morning .
i could see that he was nearly dead .
i knelt down beside him and i listened just to hear the words the dying fellow said .
he said they let me out of prison down in frisco .
for ten long years i 've paid for what i 've done .
i was trying to get back to louisiana to see my rose and get to know my son .
give my love to rose , please wo n't you mister .
take her all my money .
tell her to buy some pretty clothes .
tell my boy his daddy 's so proud of him , and do n't forget to give my love to rose .
tell them i said thanks for waiting for me .
tell my boy to help his mom at home .
tell my rose to try to find another , for it be not right that she should live alone .
mister here 's a bag with all my money .
it wo n't last them long the way it goes .
god bless you for finding me this morning , and do n't forget to give my love to rose .
give my love to rose , please wo n't you mister .
take her all my money .
tell her to buy some pretty clothes .
tell my boy his daddy 's so proud of him , and do n't forget to give my love to rose .
