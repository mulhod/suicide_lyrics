#flesh and blood

beside a singing mountain stream where the willow grew , where the silver leaf of maple sparkled in the morning dew , i braided twigs of willows .
made a string of buckeye beads , but flesh and blood need flesh and blood , and you 're the one i need .
flesh and blood need flesh and blood , and you 're the one i need .
i leaned against a bark of birch , and i breathed the honey dew .
i saw a north-bound flock of geese against a sky of baby blue .
beside the lily pads i carved a whistle from a reed .
mother nature 's quite a lady , but you 're the one i need .
flesh and blood need flesh and blood , and you 're the one i need .
a cardinal sang just for me , and i thanked him for the song .
then the sun went slowly down the west , and i had to move along .
these were some of the things on which my mind and spirit feed , but flesh and blood need flesh and blood , and you 're the one i need .
flesh and blood need flesh and blood , and you 're the one i need .
so when this day was ended , i was still not satisfied , for i knew everything i touched would wither and would die .
love is all that will remain and grow from all these seeds .
mother nature 's quite a lady , but you 're the one i need .
flesh and blood need flesh and blood , and you 're the one i need .
