#time passes slowly

time passes slowly up here in the mountains .
we set beside bridges and walk beside fountains , catch the wild fishes that float through the stream .
time passes slowly when you 're lost in a dream .
once i had a sweetheart .
she was fine and good looking .
we sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking , staring out the window to the stars high above .
time passes slow when you 're searching for love .
aing . no reason to go in a wagon to town .
aing . no reason to go to the fair .
aing . no reason to go up .
be not no reason to go down .
aing . no reason to go anywhere .
time passes slowly up here in the daylight , stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right .
like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day time passes slowly and fades away .
