# the man on the hill

will we get cold and hungry ?
will times be very bad ?
when we 're needing bread and meat , where we going to get it , dad ?
we 'll get it from the man in the house on the hill .
yes we will from the man on the hill .
ploughing time is over .
still the fields are bare .
how we going to make a living with twenty acres to share ?
i 'll beg for more land from the man on the hill .
yes i will .
i 'll ask the man on the hill .
i be not got no sunday shoes that i can wear to town .
papa reckon the boss has got a pair of hand-me-downs .
i 'll go and ask the man in the house on the hill .
yes i will .
i 'll ask the man on the hill .
maybe he will help us .
maybe we 'll get by .
but who 's going to pay the dying bills , if we all should die .
we 'll leave it to the man in the sky when we die .
yes we 'll leave it to the man in the sky .
