#tough mama

tough mama , meat shaking on your bone .
i 'm going to go down to the river and get some stone .
sister 's on the highway with that steel-driving crew .
papa 's in the big house .
his working days are through ,
tough mama , can i blow a little smoke on you ?
dark beauty , wo n't you move over and give me some room ?
it 's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom .
ashes in the furnace .
dust on the rise .
you came through it all the way , flying through the skies , dark beauty , with that long night 's journey in your eyes .
sweet goddess , born of a blinding light and a changing wind .
now , do n't be modest .
you know who you are and where you been .
jack the cowboy went up north .
he 's buried in the past .
lone wolf went out drinking .
that was over pretty fast .
sweet goddess , your perfect stranger 's coming on in at last .
silver angel , with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve , i 'd be grateful if this golden ring you 'd receive .
today on the countryside it was hotter than a crotch .
i stood alone upon the ridge and all i did was watch .
sweet goddess , must be time to carve another notch .
i 'm crestfallen , a world of illusions at my door .
i be not hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore .
prison walls are crumbling down .
there is no end in sight .
i 've gained some recognition , but i lost my appetite .
sweet beauty , meet me at the border late tonight .
