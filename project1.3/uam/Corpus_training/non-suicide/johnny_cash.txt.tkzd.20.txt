#frankie 's man , johnny

well now frankie and johnny were sweethearts .
they were true as a blue blue sky .
he was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wandering eye , but he was her man nearly all of the time .
well johnny he packed up to leave her , but he promised he 'd be back .
he said he had a little picking to do a little farther down the track .
he said i 'm your man .
i would n't do you wrong .
well frankie curled up on the sofa thinking about her man .
far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band .
he was frankie 's man he was n't doing her wrong .
then in the front door walked a redhead .
johnny saw her right away .
she came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played .
he was frankie 's man , but she was far away .
he sang every song to the redhead .
she smiled back at him .
then he came and sat at her table , where the lights were low and dim .
what frankie did n't know would n't hurt her none .
then the redhead jumped up and slapped him .
she slapped him a time or two .
she said i 'm frankie 's sister , and i was checking up on you .
if you 're her man , you better treat her right .
well the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick .
sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just ca n't tell what to pick .
he was frankie 's man , and he still be not done her wrong .
