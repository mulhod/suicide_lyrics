#tennessee flat-top box

in a little cabaret in a south texas border town , sat a boy and his guitar , and the people came from all around .
and all the girls from there to austin , were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock to take the trip , to go and listen , to the little dark-haired boy who played the tennessee flat-top box .
and he would play .
well , he could n't ride or wrangle , and he never cared to make a dime , but give him his guitar , and he 'd be happy all the time .
and all the girls from nine to ninety were snapping fingers , tapping toes , and begging him : "do n't stop . "
and hypnotized and fascinated , by the little dark-haired boy who played the tennessee flat-top box .
and he would play .
then one day he was gone , and no one ever saw him around .
he 'd vanished like the breeze .
they forgot him in the little town .
but all the girls still dreamed about him and hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked .
and then one day on the hit parade , was a little dark-haired boy who played the tennessee flat-top box .
and he would play .
