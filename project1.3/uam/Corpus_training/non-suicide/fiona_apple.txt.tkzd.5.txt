#tymps ( the sick in the head song )

those boon times wentbust .
my feet of clay , they dried to dust .
the red is n't the red we painted ; it 's just rust .
and the signature thing that used to bring a following , i have trouble now even remembering .
so why did i kiss him so hard late last friday night , and keep on letting him change all my plans ?
i 'm either so sick in the head i need to be bled dry to quit , or i just really used to love him .
i sure hope thats it .
i knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch .
cause it is n't the rush of remembering , its just mush .
and the signature thing is only growing harrowing .
i should have no trouble now to keep from following .
so why did i kiss him so hard late last friday night , and keep on letting him change all my plans ?
i 'm either so sick in the head i need to be bled dry to quit , or i just really used to love him .
i sure hope thats it .
those boon times wentbust .

i sure hope that 's it .
