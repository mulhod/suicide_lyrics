#new morning

ca n't you hear that rooster crowing ?
rabbit running down across the road , underneath the bridge where the water flowed through .
so happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you .
ca n't you hear that motor turning ?
automobile coming into style , coming down the road for a country mile or two .
so happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you .
the night passed away so quickly .
it always does when you 're with me .
ca n't you feel that sun shining ?
groundhog running by the country stream .
this must be the day that all of my dreams come true .
so happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you .
so happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you .
new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning .
