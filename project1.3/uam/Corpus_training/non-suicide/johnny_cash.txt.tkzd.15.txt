#picking time

got cotton in the bottom land .
it 's up and growing , and i got a good stand .
my good wife and them kids of mine going to get new shoes , come picking time , get new shoes come picking time .
every night when i go to bed i thank the lord that my kids are fed .
they live on beans eight days and nine , but i get them fat come picking time , get them fat come come picking time .
the corn is yellow , and the beans are high .
the sun is hot in the summer sky .
the work is hard till laying by , laying by till picking time , laying by til picking time .
it 's hard to see by the coal-oil light , and i turn it off pretty early at night because a jug of coal-oil costs a dime , but i stay up late come picking time , stay up late come picking time .
my old wagon barely gets me to town .
i patched the wheels , and i watered them down .
keep her in shape so she 'll be fine to haul my cotton come picking time , haul my cotton come picking time .
last sunday morning when they passed the hat it was still nearly empty back where i sat , but the preacher smiled and said that 's fine .
the lord 'll wait til picking time , the lord 'll wait til picking time .
