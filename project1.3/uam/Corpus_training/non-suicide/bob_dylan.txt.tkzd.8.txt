#my back pages

crimson flames tied through my ears .
rolling , high-and-mighty traps pounced with fire on flaming roads , using ideas as my maps .
"we 'll meet on edges soon , " said i , proud beneath heated brow .
ah , but i was so much older then .
i 'm younger than that now .
half-wracked prejudice leaped forth .
"rip down all hate ! " i screamed .
lies that life is black-and-white spoke from my skull .
i dreamed romantic facts of musketeers , foundationed deep somehow .
ah , but i was so much older then .
i 'm younger than that now .
girls ' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy to memorizing politics of ancient history , flung down by corpse evangelists , unthought of though , somehow .
ah , but i was so much older then .
i 'm younger than that now .
a self-ordained professor 's tongue , too serious to fool , spouted out that liberty is just equality in school .
"equality , " i spoke the word as if a wedding vow .
ah , but i was so much older then .
i 'm younger than that now .
in a soldier 's stance , i aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach , fearing not i 'd become my enemy in the instant that i preach , my existence led by confusion boats , mutiny from stern to bow .
ah , but i was so much older then .
i 'm younger than that now .
yes , my guard stood hard when abstract threats , too noble to neglect , deceived me into thinking i had something to protect .
good and bad , i define these terms quite clear no doubt , somehow .
ah , but i was so much older then .
i 'm younger than that now .
