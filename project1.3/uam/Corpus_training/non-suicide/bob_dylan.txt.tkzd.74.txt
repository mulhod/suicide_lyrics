#tonight i 'll be staying here with you

throw my ticket out the window .
throw my suitcase out there , too .
throw my troubles out the door .
i do n't need them anymore because tonight i 'll be staying here with you .
i should have left this town this morning , but it was more than i could do .
oh , your love comes on so strong and i 've waited all day long for tonight when i 'll be staying here with you .
is it really any wonder , the love that a stranger might receive ?
you cast your spell and i went under .
i find it so difficult to leave .
i can hear that whistle blowing .
i see that stationmaster , too .
if there 's a poor boy on the street , then let him have my seat because tonight i 'll be staying here with you .
throw my ticket out the window .
throw my suitcase out there , too .
throw my troubles out the door .
i do n't need them anymore because tonight i 'll be staying here with you .
