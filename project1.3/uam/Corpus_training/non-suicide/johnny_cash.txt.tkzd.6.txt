# what is truth

the old man turned off the radio said , "where did all of the old songs go ?
kids sure play funny music these days .
they play it in the strangest ways . "
said : "it looks to me like they 've all gone wild .
it was peaceful back when i was a child "
well , man , could it be that the girls and boys are trying to be heard above your noise ?
and the lonely voice of youth cries "what is truth ? "
a little boy of three sitting on the floor looks up and says : "daddy , what is war ? "
" son , that 's when people fight and die . "
the little boy of three says : "daddy , why ? "
a young man of seventeen in sunday school being taught the golden rule , and by the time another year has gone around it may be his turn to lay his life down .
can you blame the voice of youth for asking : "what is truth ? "
a young man sitting on the witness stand .
the man with the book says "raise your hand . "
"repeat after me , i solemnly swear.. . "
the man looked down at his long hair , and , although the young man solemnly swore , nobody seems to hear anymore , and it did n't really matter if the truth was there , it was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair .
and the lonely voice of youth cries : "what is truth ? "
the young girl dancing to the latest beat has found new ways to move her feet .
the young man speaking in the city square is trying to tell somebody that he cares .
yeah , the ones that you 're calling wild are going to be the leaders in a little while .
this old world 's waking to a new born day , and i solemnly swear that it 'll be their way .
you better help the voice of youth find what is truth .
