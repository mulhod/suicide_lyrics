#moth 's wings

dear friend , as you know your flowers are withering , your mother 's gone insane , your leaves have drifted away , but the clouds are clearing up and i 've come reveling , burning incandescently like a bastard on the burning sea .
you 're just like your father , buried deep under the water .
you 're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes .
whose side are you on ?
what side is this anyway ?
put down your sword and crown .
come lay with me on the ground .
you come beating like moth 's wings , spastic and violently , whipping me into a storm , shaking me down to the core , but you run away from me and you left me shimmering like diamond wedding rings spinning dizzily down on the floor .
you 're just like your father , buried deep under the water .
you 're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes .
whose side are you on ?
what side is this anyway ?
put down your sword and crown .
come lay with me on the ground .
