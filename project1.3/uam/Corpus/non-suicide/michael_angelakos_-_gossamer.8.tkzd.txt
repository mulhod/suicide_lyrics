#hideaway

who could love you in the way that you love you ?
you 're alone , darling , and there 's nothing to argue .
if your life evolves into ruin , everyone 's watching all that you 're doing .
say your head 's turning .
maybe you should start running .
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you cannot stay .
come and play , oh , my hideaway .
someday everything will be okay .
you 're not strong so you , you can hurt her so badly .
you do n't mean to , hurting her is too maddening .
when you do , it 's a war in your head .
what you mean to say is n't always worth saying .
take a deep breath as soon as you let go .
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you cannot stay .
come and play , oh , my hideaway .
someday everything will be okay .
what 's the point to this , feeling happiness in life ?
as we fight off our demise , or love as we play into its lies , oh honey .
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you cannot stay .
come and play , oh , my hideaway .
someday everything will be okay .
