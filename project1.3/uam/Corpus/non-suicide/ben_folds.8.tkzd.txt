#late

under some dirty words on a dirty wall , eating takeout by myself , i played the shows , got back in the van and put the walkman on and you were playing .
in some other dive a thousand miles away , i played a thousand times before , and like pathetic stars , the truck stops and the rock club walls i always knew , you saw them too , but you never will again .
it 's too late .
do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
elliott , man , you played a fine guitar and some dirty basketball .
the songs you wrote got me through a lot .
just want to tell you that .
but it 's too late .
it 's too late .
no , do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
oh no things were looking up , at least that 's what i heard .
oh no someone came and washed away your hard-earned peace of mind when desperate static beats the silence up , a quiet truth to calm you down .
the songs you wrote got me through a lot .
just want to tell you that .
but it 's too late .
it 's too late .
no , do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
it 's too late .
it 's too late .
no , do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
