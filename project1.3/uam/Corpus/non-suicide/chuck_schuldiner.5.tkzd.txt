#without judgement

guilty until proven innocent , we condemn your soul and fate .
never mind the possibilities .
too busy for logic or to calculate .
take part in a diminishing breed where complex turns to simplicity .
when pain is acknowledged frivolous calculations will be abolished .
without judgement what would we do ?
we would be forced to look at ourselves emerged in lost time , assuming what may be without judgement .
perception would increase a million times .
distracted by imagination that experiments with ease .
if you could taste it , it might be addictive .
where life will crush those who defy .
take part in a diminishing breed where complex turns to simplicity .
when pain is acknowledged frivolous calculations will be abolished .
take part in a diminishing breed where complex turns to simplicity .
when pain is acknowledged frivolous calculations will be abolished .
