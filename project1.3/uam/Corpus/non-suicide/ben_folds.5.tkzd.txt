#gracie

you ca n't fool me , i saw you when you came out .
you got your mama 's taste but you got my mouth .
and you will always have a part of me nobody else is ever going to see , gracie girl , with your cards to your chest walking on your toes .
what you got in the box only gracie knows .
and i would never try to make you be anything you did n't really want to be , gracie girl .
life flies by in seconds .
you 're not a baby , gracie , you 're my friend .
you 'll be a lady soon but until then you got to do what i say .
you nodded off in my arms watching tv.
i wo n't move you an inch even though my arm 's asleep.
one day you 're going to want to go .
i hope we taught you everything you need to know , gracie girl .
and there will always be a part of me nobody else is ever going to see but you and me , my little girl , my gracie girl .
