imagine

imagine there 's no heaven .
it 's easy if you try .
no hell below us , above us only sky .
imagine all the people living for today .
imagine there 's no countries .
it is n't hard to do .
nothing to kill or die for , and no religion too .
imagine all the people living life in peace .
you may say i 'm a dreamer , but i 'm not the only one .
i hope someday you 'll join us , and the world will be as one .
imagine no possessions .
i wonder if you can .
no need for greed or hunger , a brotherhood of man .
imagine all the people sharing all the world .
you may say i 'm a dreamer , but i 'm not the only one .
i hope someday you 'll join us , and the world will live as one .
