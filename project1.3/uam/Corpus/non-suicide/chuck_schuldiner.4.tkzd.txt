#scared serenity

wherever we go , whatever we do , your shadow is not far behind our steps and our breath .
protecting and watching all .
observing spirits on the wall .
what are they telling you ?
following all instincts that are pure .
oblivious to time that may be the cure .
sacred is the gift that they have without knowing .
serenity is knowing it 's safe from destruction of time .
maybe we could take a step back and discover what leads us to attack .
time that is short .
distance unknown .
for them , each day life has just begun .
observing spirits on the wall .
what are they telling you ?
following all instincts that are pure .
oblivious to time that may be the cure .
observing spirits on the wall .
what are they telling you ?
following all instincts that are pure .
oblivious to time that may be the cure .
