symbolic

i do n't mean to dwell , but i ca n't help myself when i feel the vibe and taste a memory of a time in life when years seemed to stand still .
i close my eyes and sink within myself .
relive the gift of precious memories in need of a fix called innocence .
when did it begin ?
the change to come was undetectable .
the open wounds expose the importance of our innocence , a high that can never be bought or sold .
symbolic acts , so vivid yet at the same time were invisible .
savor what you feel and what you see , things that may not seem important now but may be tomorrow .
do you remember when things seemed so eternal ?
heroes were so real , their magic frozen in time .
the only way to learn is be aware and hold on tight .
i close my eyes and sink within myself .
relive the gift of precious memories in need of a fix called innocence .
when did it begin ?
the change to come was undetectable .
the open wounds expose the importance of our innocence , a high that can never be bought or sold .
i close my eyes and sink within myself .
relive the gift of precious memories in need of a fix called innocence .
when did it begin ?
the change to come was undetectable .
the open wounds expose the importance of our innocence , a high that can never be bought or sold .
