#woman do n't you cry for me

i 'm going to leave you here .
i 'm going to leave you at the station .
i 've got a long way to go , baby .
woman , do n't you cry for me .
now , i ca n't take no more .
now , i do n't need no complication .
i 've got a long way to go , baby .
woman , do n't you cry for me .
there 's no one place i want to be .
attachment only hurts you .
take care of yourself , baby .
come on , wo n't you let me be ?
there 's just one thing i got to see .
that 's the lord .
got to keep him in sight .
take care of yourself , baby .
come on , wo n't you let me be ?
there 's no one place i want to be .
attachment only hurts you .
better take care of yourself , baby .
come on , wo n't you try to see ? .
there is just one thing i got to see .
that 's the lord .
got to keep him in sight .
better take care of yourself , baby .
come on , wo n't you let me be ?
now , baby , here 's the door .
i do n't need no aggravation .
i 've got a long way to go , baby .
woman , do n't you cry for me ?
i 'm going to leave you here .
i 'm going to leave you at the station .
i 've got a long way to go , baby .
woman , do n't you cry for me .
i 've got a long way to go , baby .
woman , do n't you cry for me .
