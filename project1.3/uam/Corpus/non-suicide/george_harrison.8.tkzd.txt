no matter where you roam , know our love is true .
while growing up or trying to , not knowing where to start , i looked around for someone who may help reveal my heart .
someone said , while you 're a part of cracerbox palace , do what the rest all do or face the fact that . crackerbox palace may have no other choice than to deport you .
