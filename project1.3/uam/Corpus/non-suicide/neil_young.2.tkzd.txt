#old man

old man , look at my life i 'm a lot like you were .
old man , look at my life , i 'm a lot like you were .
old man , look at my life , twenty-four and there 's so much more .
live alone in a paradise that makes me think of two .
love lost , such a cost , give me things that do n't get lost , like a coin that wo n't get tossed rolling home to you .
old man , take a look at my life , i 'm a lot like you .
i need someone to love me the whole day through .
ah , one look in my eyes and you can tell that 's true .
lullabies , look in your eyes , run around the same old town .
does n't mean that much to me to mean that much to you .
i 've been first and last .
look at how the time goes past .
but i 'm all alone at last , rolling home to you .
old man , take a look at my life , i 'm a lot like you .
i need someone to love me the whole day through .
ah , one look in my eyes and you can tell that 's true .
old man , look at my life , i 'm a lot like you were .
old man look at my life , i 'm a lot like you were .
