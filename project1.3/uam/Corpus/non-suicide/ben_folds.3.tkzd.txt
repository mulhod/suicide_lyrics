#jesusland

take a walk .
out the gate you go and never stop , past dollar stores and wig shops , quarter in a cup for every block .
and watch the buildings grow smaller as you go down the tracks , beautiful mcmansions on a hill that . overlook a highway with riverboat casinos and you still have yet to see a soul .
jesusland , jesusland .
town to town , broadcast to each house , they drop your name , but no one knows your face .
billboards quoting things you 'd never say .
you hang your head and pray for jesusland , jesusland .
miles and miles , and the sun going down .
pulses glow from their homes .
you 're not alone .
lights come on as you lay your weary head on their lawn .
parking lots , cracked and growing grass .
you see it all from offices to farms .
crosses flying high above the malls .
a longer walk through jesusland , jesusland .
