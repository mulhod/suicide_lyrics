make light

so now we see .
comes burying my burnt remains .
these puddled clouds .
oh i , i understand now .
but darkness falls likes shattered pieces , dangling , shimmering , torn and tattered and crowned .
oh , i 'll not be told "no " to no more .
you must believe to hear me sing these messy morsels of my self-assuring love .
oh , it 's painful kneading .
yes , i lie and i wrangle with prospective angles that glare me down and face me with all i do wrong .
why do they all look like me ?
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh just to prove i 'm alive .
and it 's alright because tonight there 's a way i 'll make light of my treacherous life .
if i had hands , i 'd hold up high my lofty dreams , my alibi 's real name .
but i have no strength .
so i toss and i turn and i spit in the urn .
there 's a ghost in your eye .
there is someone that knows more than i .
but i 'm quick to deny .
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh just to prove i 'm alive .
and it 's alright because tonight there 's a way i 'll make light of my treacherous life .
make light !
