i am the cosmos

every night i tell myself : "i am the cosmos , i am the wind , " but that do n't get you back again .
just when i was starting to feel okay , you 're on the phone .
i never want to be alone never want to be alone .
i hate to have to take you home .
wanted too much to say no , no .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , never want to be alone .
i hate to have to take you home .
want you too much to say no , no .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , my feeling 's always happening , something i could n't hide .
i ca n't confide .
do n't know what 's going on inside .
so every night i tell myself : "i am the cosmos , i am the wind , " but that do n't get you back again .
i 'd really like to see you again .
i really want to see you again .
i 'd really like to see you again .
i really want to see you again .
i 'd really like to see you again .
i really want to see you again .
i never want to see you again .
really want to see you again .
