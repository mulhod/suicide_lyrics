#sue me , sue you blues

you serve me and i 'll serve you .
swing your partners .
all get screwed .
bring your lawyer and i 'll bring mine .
get together and we could have a bad time .
its affidavit swearing time .
sign it on the dotted line .
hold your bible in your hand .
now all that 's left is to find yourself a new band .
we 're going to play the sue me , sue you blues .
we 're going to play the sue me , sue you blues .
hold the block on money flow .
move it into joint escrow .
court receiver laughs and thrills , but in the end we just pay those lawyers their bills .
well , you serve me and i serve you .
swing your partners .
all get screwed .
bring your lawyer and i 'll bring mine .
get together and we could have a bad time .
were going to play the sue me , sue you blues .
i 'm tired of playing the sue me , sue you blues .
