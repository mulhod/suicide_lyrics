#going down on love

got to get down , down on my knees .
got to get down , down on my knees .
going down on love .
going down on love .
going down , going down , going down .
when the real thing goes wrong and you ca n't get it on and your love , she has gone and you got to carry on and you shoot out the light , ai n't coming home for the night , you know you got to , got to , got to pay the price .
somebody please , please help me .
you know i 'm drowning in the sea of hatred .
got to get down , down on my knees .
got to get down , down on my knees .
going down on love .
going down on love .
going down , going down , going down .
something precious and rare disappears in thin air and it seems so unfair .
nothing doing nowhere .
well , you burn all your boats and you sow your wild oats .
well , you know , you know , you know the price is right !
