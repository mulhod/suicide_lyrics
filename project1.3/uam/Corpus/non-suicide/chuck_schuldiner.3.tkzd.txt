#empty words

ashes and promises share a bond through the winds of change .
words are blown away when visions that should be are tattooed in your mind .
the power to let go is sometimes hard to find .
the answer cannot be found in the writing of others or the words of a trained mind .
in a precious world of memories , we find ourselves confined .
claws so razor sharp , ripping at the spirit .
promises a potential to hurt .
is anything real ?
when forever is to be until .
deep inside , in the world of empty words .
no escaping from those haunting empty words .
do you ever feel it ?
a craving that is so strong to by thought .
rewind in order to find expectations that shined through the doubt that soon would turn into the price of what a word will be worth .
when tomorrow comes to be and we are left standing on our own and seeing what is real .
the answer cannot be found in the writing of others or the words of a trained mind .
in a precious world of memories , we find ourselves confined .
claws so razor sharp , ripping at the spirit .
the answer cannot be found in the writing of others or the words of a trained mind .
in a precious world of memories , we find ourselves confined .
claws so razor sharp , ripping at the spirit .
