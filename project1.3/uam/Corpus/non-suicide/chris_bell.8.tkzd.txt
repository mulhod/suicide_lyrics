#i got kinda lost

i got kind of lost .
i got kind of lost .
i got kind of lost in giving .
i got kind of lost .
and what can i say feeling the way i do ?
i 'm trying to get it across to you .
only wanted to be together .
all the time that it was i saw her .
things that i 'd done before are gone .
i ca n't believe i 'm on my own .
once in a while , and i see you smile , but you do n't know how it 's going .
