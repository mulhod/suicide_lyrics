# the light that has lighted the world

i 've heard how some people have said that i 've changed , that i 'm not what i was , how it really is a shame .
the thoughts in their heads manifest on their brow , like bad scars from ill feelings they themselves arouse .
so hateful of anyone that is happy or free , they live all their lives without looking to see the light that has lighted the world .
it 's funny how people just wo n't accept change as if nature itself they 'd prefer re-arranged .
so hard to move on when you 're down in a hole , where there 's so little chance to experience soul .
i 'm greatful to anyone that is happy or free for giving me hope while i 'm looking to see the light that has lighted the world .
