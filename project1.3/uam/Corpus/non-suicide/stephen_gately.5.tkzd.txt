#you lied

i ca n't figure out just what went wrong .
i remember a love so strong .
good times , bad times , were carelessly so free , but it happened to me .
i heard from my friends you were cheating on me .
i sat up waiting .
it was quarter past three .
you said you stopped , that you quit playing around , but i finally found out you lied .
oh , you took my soul .
you took it away from me .
you lied oh .
i 've lost control .
i 've lost the way we used to be .
why did it happen ?
why was it me ?
you broke your promise , our destiny .
i gave you my love , my soul , my heart , but you tore it apart .
you ca n't deny it .
it 's so easy to see .
so tell me who was on your caller id .
i ca n't forgive you .
you know you 've done wrong , and i 've finally found out .

i 've cried .

why did you tell those lies to me ?
i have to face what 's happened .
it was n't meant to be like this .
now i see it 's over .
my questions must be answered .
