#jealous guy

i was dreaming of the past , and my heart was beating fast .
i began to lose control .
i began to lose control .
i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm sorry that i made you cry .
oh , no , i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm just a jealous guy .
i was feeling insecure .
you might not love me anymore .
i was shivering inside .
i was shivering inside .
i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm sorry that i made you cry .
oh , my , i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm just a jealous guy .
i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm sorry that i made you cry .
oh , my , i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm just a jealous guy .
i was trying to catch your eye .
i thought that you were trying to hide .
i was swallowing my pain .
i was swallowing my pain .
i did n't mean to hurt you .
i 'm sorry that i made you cry .
oh , my , i did n't want to hurt you .
i 'm just a jealous guy .
watch out , baby , i 'm just a jealous guy .
look out , baby , i 'm just a jealous guy .
