# where we belong

it 's gotten cold in here , but a solemn warmth draws near and with a gentle touch all these burdens and such fears are wiped clear .
who says you ought to stay ?
how 's this the easier way ?
it 's far from giving up .
cowards never say enough is enough .
and then i 'm lifted up out of the crimson tub
the bath begins to drain and from the floor he prays away all my pain .
who says that god exists ?
we ca n't see icons or myths , but , well , i believe in you .
do you believe in me , too , gabriel ?
all the things you ca n't control should never destroy the love one holds .
i found a place , i found a place , i found a place where we belong .
never be up and down , be in between the whitest clouds .
never did i ever think i 'd find all the things i 've found because how you keep on living when you 're always but a million down .
all i 've ever wanted was to be happy and make you proud .
