# judgement day

someday i know i 'll find my way to say .
what makes the world a better place , you say ?
my mind is telling me to fight for my rights .
i 've learned my lesson , done my time .
someone please just save me .
help me .
please do n't break me , i pray , i pray , i pray .
it 's crazy .
my heart 's pounding .
save me on judgement day , my day , doomsday .
i know that i have made mistakes .
i 've paid .
please do n't give my soul away .
i 'm dreaming of freedom .
i watch from my window inside .
my pulse and my breathing is what i am needing for life .
you 've watched me sleepless .
seen me cry .
oh , why ?
help me .
my life is on the line .
someone please just save me .
help me please do n't break me , i pray .
i pray .
it 's crazy .
my heart 's pounding .
save me on judgement day , my day , my day , my day , my day .
my mind is telling me to fight for my rights .
i 've learned my lesson , done my time .
someone please just save me
help me .
please do n't break me , i pray .
i pray .
it 's crazy .
my heart 's pounding .
save me on judgement day , my day .
save me .
help me .
please do n't break me .
my day , my day .
it 's crazy .
my heart 's pounding .
save me on judgement day , my day .
