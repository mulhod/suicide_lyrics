give me love , give me love , give me peace on earth .
give me light , give me life , keep me free from birth .

trying to touch and reach you with heart and soul , my lord .
please take hold of my hand that i might understand you .
wo n't you please , oh , wo n't you ?
give me love , give me love , give me peace on earth .
give me light , give me life , keep me free from birth .
give me hope , help me cope with this heavy load .
trying to touch and reach you with heart and soul , my lord .
please take hold of my hand that i might understand you .
