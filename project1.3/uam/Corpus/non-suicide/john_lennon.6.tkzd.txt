#cold turkey

temperature 's rising , fever is high .
ca n't see no future .
ca n't see no sky .
my feet are so heavy , so is my head .
i wish i was a baby .
i wish i was dead .
cold turkey has got me on the run .
body is aching , goose pimple bone .
ca n't see no body .
leave me alone .
my eyes are wide open .
ca n't get to sleep.
one thing i 'm sure of , i 'm at the deep freeze .
cold turkey has got me on the run .
cold turkey has got me on the run .
thirty-six hours rolling in pain .
praying to someone .
free me again .
oh , i 'll be a good boy .
please make me well .
i promise you anything .
get me out of this hell .
