#if only you were here

if only you were here today forever and if only you were mine , i would say it 's forever .
i 've read through the lines , oh , yeah .
i 've read through the lines .
so is that how the story goes ?
is the book now closed ?
said you 'd always be around , oh , yeah .
and i ca n't deny , yeah , i ca n't deny the way you left me on my own , i thought our love had grown and we 'd never be apart .
if only you were here today forever and if only you were mine , i would say it 's forever because i cannot help myself , ohm no , no , from falling in love .
i used to know why , i used to know why our love was endless .
time gone by like angels in the sky .
never thought i 'd be so wrong , oh , yeah , and i ca n't decide , yeah , and i ca n't decide whether our love was in despair instead of playing fair .
and i 'll miss you since you 've gone .
if only you were here today forever and if only you were mine , i would say it 's forever because i cannot help myself , oh , no , no , from falling in love , if only you were here , yeah , because i ca n't help myself , oh , no , no , from falling in love .
if only you were here today , forever , yeah , if only you were here , i would say it 's forever because i cannot help myself from falling in love .
if only you were here today forever and if only you were mine , i would say it 's forever .
