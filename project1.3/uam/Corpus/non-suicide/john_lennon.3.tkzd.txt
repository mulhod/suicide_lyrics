#mother

mother , you had me , but i never had you .
i wanted you , but you did n't want me .
so i 've got to tell you goodbye , goodbye .
father , you left me , but i never left you .
i needed you , but you did n't need me .
so i just got to tell you goodbye , goodbye .
children , do n't do what i have done .
i could n't walk , and i tried to run .
so i got to tell you goodbye , goodbye .
mama , do n't go .
daddy , come home .
mama , do n't go .
daddy , come home .
mama , do n't go .
daddy , come home .
mama , do n't go .
daddy , come home .
