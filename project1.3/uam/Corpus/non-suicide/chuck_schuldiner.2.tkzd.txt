#zero tolerance

in the dark of night , abusing a portion of light while others are sleeping , and some are escaping , a serpent spews out fantasy , unjustified blasphemy , that cannot be condoned .
it must be strange to not have lived so far into existence .
this is not a test of power .
this is not a game to be lost or won .
let justice be done .
there will be zero tolerance for the creator of hallowed intentions .
there will be zero tolerance .
fate is your deciding god .
karma comes crashing down , leaving a very deep scar , exposing a door to the source of a verbal whore .
machines supply the altar where virtuous lives are sacrificed .
it must be strange to not have lived so far into existence .
this is not a test of power .
this is not a game to be lost or won .
let justice be done .
