#all things must pass

sunrise does n't last all morning .
a cloudburst does n't last all day .
seems my love is up and has left you with no warning .
it 's not always going to be this grey .
all things must pass .
all things must pass away .
sunset does n't last all evening .
a mind can blow those clouds away .
after all this , my love is up and must be leaving .
it 's not always going to be this grey .
all things must pass .
all things must pass away .
all things must pass .
none of life 's strings can last , so i must be on my way and face another day .
now the darkness only stays the nighttime .
in the morning it will fade away .
daylight is good at arriving at the right time .
it 's not always going to be this grey .
all things must pass .
all things must pass away .
all things must pass .
all things must pass away .
