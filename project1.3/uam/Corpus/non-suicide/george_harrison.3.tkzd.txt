#art of dying

there 'll come a time when all of us must leave here .
then nothing sister mary can do will keep me here with you as nothing in this life that i 've been trying . could equal or surpass the art of dying .
do you believe me ?
there 'll come a time when all your hopes are fading , when things that seemed so very plain become an awful . pain , searching for the truth among the lying and answered when you 've learned the art of dying .
but you 're still with me , but if you want it , then you must find it .
but when you have it , there 'll be no need for it .
there 'll come a time when most of us return here , brought back by our desire to be a perfect entity , living through a million years of crying until you 've realized the art of dying .
do you believe me ?
