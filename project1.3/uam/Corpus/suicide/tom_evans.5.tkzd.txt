#money

money stole my lady .
fools have a way of making me lazy .
money buy you freedom .
rules have a way of making me crazy .
so we grow a little older with another tale to tell .
so we grow a little colder with another tale to tell .
money make you feel unhappy .
fools have a way of making me crazy .
so we grow a little older with another tale to tell .
so we grow a little colder with another tale to tell .
