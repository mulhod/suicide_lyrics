guns in the sky

see the sound .
it crashes in , all around .
it gets in .
now take your hands and raise them up into the air that 's all around you .
now bring them down like a clock at two .
shake your head you know what to do .
they want to put guns in the sky .
someone out there is n't going to like it , but it could be good .
make us love each other .
have to realize i own the future .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
child grows up to see guns in the sky .
used to be on t .v.
want to change .
forgot the joke .
it 's great to see you .
i 'm running late .
love your hair .
lend me a ten .
love your big house .
could you spare a dime ?
well i 'm sick of it .
it 's a load of shit .
we could stop the world and let of all the fools , and let them go , live with their guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
guns in the sky .
