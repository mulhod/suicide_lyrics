# the plymouth mail

the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
when i was a lad i used to play by the roadside all the live-long day , hoping always to espy the gentry 's coaches rolling by .
when i was a youth i used to roam with a waggoner from town to town , but i longed to fly across the land on a stagecoach high with a four-in-hand .
now i am grown unto a man on the driver 's box i take my stand .
like the captain bold of a ship of sail , i 'm the man who drives the plymouth mail .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
with six on top and four inside , the post-poy and the guard beside , their bags and baggage safely stowed , it 's time to take the open road .
then the hooves do fly , and the wheels spin round and we bid adieu to plymouth town .
plympton , brent , and ashburton pass , and to exeter we comes at last .
then the horses blow , and their sides do steam , as the ostlers run to change the team .
the travellers gulp a glass of ale then back they scramble on the plymouth mail .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
we roll across the dorset downs and stage again in shaftesbury town .
then i crack my whip with might and main , and on we roll to salisbury plain .
soon over hounslow heath we fly where the gibbets loom against the sky .
and the passengers all hide their gold for fear we meet some robbers bold .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
at the sign of the standard in cornhill , at last my rumbling wheels are still .
and the passengers all stiff and sore thank god their journey 's safely over .
in a cozy parlor now i stand with a goodly bumper to my hand , and the travellers drink a glass of ale to the health of the driver of the plymouth mail .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
