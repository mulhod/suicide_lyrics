#let me show you

this shattered town gets me down .
my ticket 's booked then you were found .
i tore them up like you tore my heart .
i 'm black and blue from love and art .
give it up ; give me .
who could take it ?
give it up ; give me .
i guess i 'll shake it , but noone touches all you are .
give it up .
strip to show me all you are .
let me show you how you make me feel .
i 've got my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
yeah , but we’re gonna make you feel .
let me show you how you make me feel .
i 've got my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
well through the twilight how i 've tried to get my thoughts deep in your mind .
in my sleep i 've tasted you , intoxicated by your every move .
give it up ; give me .
who could take it ?
give it up ; give me .
i guess i 'll shake it , but noone touches all you are .
give it up .
let me show you all you are .
let me show you how you make me feel .
i 've got my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
but we’re gonna make you feel .
let me show you how you make me feel .
i 've got my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
wow !
because we’re gonna make you feel .
let me show you how you make me feel .
i 've got my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
ow !
i bet how you’re gonna make me feel .
let me show you how you make me feel .
ow , hit me !
let me show you how you make me feel .
just how you help me feel .
let me show you how you make me feel .
oh , put my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
i 've got my finger on the trigger .
let me show you how you make me feel .
