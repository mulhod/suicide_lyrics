#do n't you miss me a little bit baby

i hear you 're telling everybody that you 're glad i 'm gone .
do you tell them how you cried whenever you were all alone ?
we both know for us there 'll never , never be another , so forget about your foolish pride and let 's get back together .
listen , who cares who was right or wrong ?
i just know i need you and by your side is where i belong .
do n't you miss me a little bit , baby , because i 'm missing you ?
say you miss me a little bit , baby .
if you take me back , people will call you a fool .
deep down inside you know you need me as much as i need you .
because of your pride you 're letting two hearts suffer .
baby , ca n't you see you 're only making things tougher ?
who cares who was right or wrong ?
please take me back , baby , because by your side is where i belong .
do n't you miss me a little bit , baby ?
please tell me that you do .
say you miss me a little bit , baby .
girl , i walk these streets day and night alone and downhearted every doggone day , baby , since we 've been parted , aimlessly with no sense of direction .
baby , i 'm trying to tell you .
i need your sweet love and affection , yes , i do , yes , i do .
ca n't make it without you .
i need you .
oh , yeah , yes , i do .
this loneliness and separation makes too high a price to pay .
when two people love each other the way we do , should nothing stand in their way .
you 're making a mountain out of a molehill .
because of your pride you 're letting a little misunderstanding push true love aside .
who cares who was right or wrong ?
just say you want me back , baby , and i come running , running back home .
do n't you miss me a little bit , baby ?
please tell me that you do .
my was living without you , baby .
girl , just take me back , forget your pride .
i need you , baby , by my side .
ca n't stand this being away from you .
ca n't you see what i 'm going through ?
