#i do n't care anymore

you 're leaving me .
you say that we are through .
i ca n't believe that you found someone new , but now i plainly see that love 's not mean for me , so go ahead and go .
walk out the door cause darling i do n't care anymore .
i finally thought that i had found the girl for me , but you 're just like the others .
you turn your back on me .
i always thought that you were meant for me .
i always thought that love just had to be .
love 's one thing i ca n't win .
i 'll never try again , so go ahead and go .
walk out the door .
darling i do n't care anymore .
before you go , there 's just one thing i ask : a kiss from you .
it 's going to be my last .
this is the end you see .
love 's not meant for me , so go ahead and go .
walk out the door .
darling i do n't care anymore .
darling i do n't care anymore .
darling i do n't care anymore .
