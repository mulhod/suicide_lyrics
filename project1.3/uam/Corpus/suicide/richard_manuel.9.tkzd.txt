oh , jawbone , when did you first go wrong ?
oh , jawbone , where is it you belong ?
three time loser , you 'll never learn , lay down your tools before you burn .
you keep on running and hiding your face , spreading your heat all over the place .
i 'm a thief and i dig it !
i 'm up on a beef , i 'm gonna rig it !
i 'm a thief and i dig it !
oh , jawbone , why do n't you sit and moan ?
oh , jawbone , you know that it 's stone for stone .
sneak through the night upon your toes .
to look in your eye , it never shows .
your name upon the post office wall put you on edge because they wrote it too small !
oh , jawbone , revenge stays on your mind .
oh , jawbone , you been doing too much time .
pull off a job with an inside man who needs the cash and likes your plan .
then you will know just who to thank when you land right back in the tank .
oh , jawbone , why do n't you go home ?
oh , jawbone , where is it you belong ?
boosting and going out on the lam .
you know that you 'll steal anything that you can .
temptation stands just behind the door , so what you want to go and open it for ?
