fisherman

between the darkness and the light , as the stars fade out of sight , i can hear his shiny boots fall on the sand .
with a basket at his side , and the morning full of pride you can see him cast his line with skillful hands .
hey , hey , fisherman , wish you luck that 's all i can .
hey , hey , fisherman , forget the world if that 's your plan .
as the morning turns to noon , he 's content to sit and croon , and he lights his twisted pipe and settles down .
onward goes the time as he tries new baited line , so he digs another worm up from the ground .
hey , hey , fisherman , wish you luck that 's all i can .
hey , hey , fisherman , forget the world if that 's your plan .
between the nightness and the light , the line is taut .
he has a bite , and he hauls the beauty in with skillful pride .
and his patient mind is blown because the fish is overgrown .
it was really worth a day for such a prize .
hey hey , fisherman .
