cry myself to sleep

the party 's over .
everybody go home .
i 'm sorry , but i 'd like to be alone because every time i see her i have to weep.
i 'm going to cry myself to sleep.
i threw this party .
never thought she 'd come back .
all she wants to do is see me cry because every time i see her i have to weep.
i 'm going to cry myself to sleep , cry , cry , cry .
did you notice how she danced with every guy but me ?
she loves to see me in misery .
i used to be her little buttercup , but now she comes around to break me up .
so everybody , wo n't you please go home ?
they party 's over , and i 'd like to be alone because when i see her i just have to weep.
i 'm going to cry myself to sleep , cry , cry , cry , cry .
