#fear

tell me something .
i 've got to know .
all your troubles , i want to own .
i 'm not preaching because i 'm full of sin .
nothing 's secret that i have not done .
alone with your situation .
fear on the face you 're saving .
kiss the warm knives as they dig for your soul .
there in the corner of my dirty home .
take the silver .
i 've paid that price .
here 's the scandal .
they do n't let the truth get in the way .
alone with your situation .
fear on the face you 're saving .
do n't you worry .
do n't you run away .
there are some things that we know will never change .
do n't you worry .
do n't you look away .
there are some things that we know we 'll have to change .
burning , teasing , searching , fever , twisting , turning , i 'm the white truth dealer .
alone with your situation .
fear on the face you 're saving .
