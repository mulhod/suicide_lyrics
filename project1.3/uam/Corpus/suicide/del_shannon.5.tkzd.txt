# i 'm going to move on

i 've been in this town , i guess too long .
too many parties and too many songs .
do n't got no job .
do n't got no gold .
the sheriff 's coming , so i better go .
he let me out of jail just yesterday .
said get a job or be on my way .
working never did agree with me .
it tires you down and you ca n't be free .
so i 'm going to move on .
i 'm moving on .
i 'm going to move on .
i 'm moving on .
it 's been fun , but i 've got to run .
i 'm going to move on .
we had a big party one saturday night .
someone got drunk and started a fight .
i got thirty days in the county jail .
i did n't have money .
could n't post my bail .
so i 'm going to move on .
i 'm moving on .
i 'm going to move on .
i 'm moving on .
it 's been fun but i 've got to run .
i 'm going to move on .
maybe some day i 'll settle down .
find a wife and quit bumming around .
but until i 'll do , i 'll be on the run , going to parties and having fun .
i 'm going to move on .
i 'm moving on .
i 'm going to move on .
i 'm moving on .
it 's been fun , but i 've got to run .
i 'm going to move on .
