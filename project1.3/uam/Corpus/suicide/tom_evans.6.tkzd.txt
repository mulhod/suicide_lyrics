#it 's over

pack my bag .
i 'm going away .
it 's over .
going home .
thank you , people , but it 's too much to stay .
it 's done now .
i 'm going home .
now i feel like i 'm warm .
now i feel like i 'm tuned .
spent my time and some fun , and for that i thank you .
it 's over .
it 's over .
it 's over .
i 'm going home .
it 's over .
it 's over , and for that i thank you .
now i feel like i 'm warm .
now i feel like i 'm tuned .
spent my time and some fun , and for that i thank you .
it 's over .
it 's over .
it 's over .
i 'm going home .
it 's over .
it 's over , and for that i thank you .
