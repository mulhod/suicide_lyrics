# just another whistle stop

to all concerned dead or alive , the locomotive will arrive , bringing souls from all around .
they 'll be bound for higher ground .
look out , stranger , it 's coming through with plenty of room for me and you and it 's just another whistle stop .
if you do n't quit till we reach the top , i 'd be much obliged to you .
odd man out .
you know that 's the rule .
you can scream and you can shout , but they 'll only call you a crazy fool .
pay no mind to what they say .
when they 're bitter , they talk that way .
i seen a young boy on the run and i seen other children having fun .
a police siren flashing light .
i wonder who went down tonight .
people , people , where do you go before you believe in what you know ?
it 's just another whistle stop .
if you do n't quit till we reach the top , i 'd be much obliged to you .
when the trolley is clean out of reach , a certain lesson it will teach .
to grind your axe until it 's dull , you 've got to get it in your skull .
tell the people all across the sea , do n't turn your back because it 's free .
it 's just another whistle stop .
if you do n't quit till we reach the top , i 'd , i 'd be much obliged to you .
and it 's odd man out .
you know that 's the rule .
you can scream and you can shout , but they 'll only call you a crazy fool .
pay no mind to what you read .
there 's one way home that 's guaranteed .
