#i wish it would rain

sunshine blue skies , please go away .
the girl has found another and gone away .
with her went my future .
my life is filled with gloom , so day after day i stay locked up in my room .
i know to you it might sound strange , but i wish it would rain because so badly i wanna go outside , but everyone knows that a man ai n't supposed to cry .
listen , i gotta cry because crying eases the pain .
oh , yeah , people , this hurt i feel inside words could never explain .
i just wish it would rain .
day in day out my tear-stained face pressed against the window pane , my eyes search the skies desperately for rain because rain-drops will hide my tear-drops and no one will ever know that i 'm crying , crying when i go outside .
to the world outside my tears i refuse to explain .
oh , i wish it would rain .
let it rain , let it rain .
i need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes .
oh , let it rain .
i 'm a man and i got my pride .
till it rains i 'm gonna stay inside and let it rain .
