#so long baby

i see you 're laughing and telling everyone in town that you 've made a fool of me .
well , go and talk some more because baby i do n't care no more .
you do n't bother me at all .
because i got news for you .
i was untrue too , and i do n't care what you say .
so go and laugh some more because baby i do n't care no more .
i 've got another lover of my own .
step by step , you put me down .
always calling me a clown .
if you ever go away , promise me that you 'll stay far , far , far , far , far from me .
now that we 've played our game , i guess we 're both to blame .
we tried to break each others hearts .
you had one jump on me , but i jumped twice you see .
it 's over now .
be on your way .
so long , baby .
be on your way .
i had a ball .
you thought i 'd fall .
you had one jump on me , but i jumped twice you see .
it 's over now .
be on your way .
so long , baby .
be on your way .
come on , baby , be on your way .
come on , baby , be on your way .
come on , baby .
