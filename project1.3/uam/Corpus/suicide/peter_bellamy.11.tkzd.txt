# the black and bitter night

it is cold , sad , and lonely in this dismal cell .
no solace comes up with the day .
my heart knows an anguish that no tongue can tell since they 've taken my true love away .
oh , the black and bitter night , and oh , the weary day .
my love has been snatched far , far from my sight , and the transports will bear her away .
when first in this prison so deep was my pain .
then she came and she banished dismay .
but now in despondence i 'm drowning again , for they 've taken my true love away .
though surrounded by horrors , yet we found delight , for where love is , no sorrow can stay .
but misery and squalor swim back to my sight now they 've taken my true love away
why , the grasses still grow , and the streams still down flow , and the blackbird still sings on the spray .
but in dank , deary dungeons there 's nothing but woe since they 've taken my true love away .
well , if i were a seagull , i 'd fly to her side , and it 's there that i wish i could stay .
but soon the cruel prison ships leave with the tide and they 've bearing my true love away .
if i were a herring , i 'd wait by the slip , though i waited a year and a day .
then through the wide ocean i 'd follow the ship that is bearing my true love away
so lovers , cling fast to each pleasure you find and cherish each moment of play , for all you will have is what stays in your mind once they 've taken your true love away .
