#hats off to larry

once i had a pretty girl .
her name , it does n't matter .
she went away with another guy .
now he wo n't even look at her .
hats off to larry .
he broke your heart just like you broke mine when you said we must part .
he told you lies .
now it 's your turn to cry , cry , cry .
now that larrys said goodbye to you .
i know this may sound strange , i want you back .
i think you 'll change , but there 's one more thing i got to say :
hats off to larry .
it may sound cruel , but you laughed at me when you said we were through .
he told you lies now its your turn to cry , cry , cry .
now that larrys said goodbye to you .
hats off to larry .
it may sound cruel , but you laughed at me when you said we were through .
he told you lies now its your turn to cry , cry , cry .
now that larrys said goodbye to you .
