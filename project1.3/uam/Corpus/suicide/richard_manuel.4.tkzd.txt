#lonesome suzie

lonesome suzie never got the breaks .
she 's always losing and so she sits and cries and shakes .
it 's hard just to watch her and , if i touch her , oh , poor suzie , i 'm wondering what to do .
she just sits there hoping for a friend .
i do n't fit here , but i may have a friend to lend .
maybe i mistook her , but i ca n't overlook her .
must be someone who can pull her through .
anyone who 's felt that bad could tell me what to say .
even if she just got mad she might be better off that way .
and where is all the understanding ?
her problems ca n't be that demanding .
why is it she looks my way every time she starts to cry ?
lonesome suzie , i ca n't watch you cry no longer , if you can use me until you feel a little stronger .
i guess just watching you has made me lonesome too .
why do n't we get together ?
what else can we do ?
