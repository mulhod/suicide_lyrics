#norwich jail

so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail .
the food is foul .
the air is bad .
the company not choice .
it would make you scowl to hear that mad old turnkey 's rasping voice .
it would make you wonder would you ever live to tell the tale of the hardships and the miseries you 've known in norwich jail .
our water here is scummy-green .
our beds is heaps of straw .
there 's water running down the walls , rats running over the floor .
there 's naught to eat but rotten meat that 'd make a dog turn pale .
oh , it 's dainty board and lodging when you visit norwich jail !
so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail .
whene 'er we fancy bathing , we paddles in the drains .
and when we wants a concert , we rattles of our chains .
and when we want a banquet we drink sludge and call it ale .
if you want a good time , commit a crime and come to norwich jail !
now if you fancy gaming here , the race is run by fleas .
the stakes are perilously high : a crust of moldy cheese .
the first time that i tried my luck , i nearly lost my shirt .
but lucky for me they could n't see the bugger for the dirt .
so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail .
if they 'd sent us to america , today we would be free .
but since the revolution that land we 'll never see .
we are not for new england 's shores , three thousand miles away .
they say we 're bound for some further ground and they 've named it botany bay .
well perhaps it 's out by india , or maybe near japan .
just off the coast of canada or in the hills of spain .
but wherever that strange land may be we know it cannot fail to be a far , far better place than stinking norwich jail .
so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale we long for the day when we 'll sail away from stinking norwich jail .
