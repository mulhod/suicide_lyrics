#hey little girl

last night i walked through the streets of my town .
i saw the shadow of a girl i had known .
and through the shadows i could see many tears , and so i walked up and i said :
hey , little girl , let me fix your broken heart .
i 'll replace each broken part that 's gone because i know i could try .
hey , little girl , my heart 's been broken too .
do you remember last september when i met you at a dance ?
you were with a guy named joe , and all at once he said you had to go .
i never even caught your name !
hey , little girl , i 've been searching everywhere , here , there , everywhere for you because i have cried for you .
hey , little girl , i 'm so in love with you !
hey , little girl , i can see that he was mean .
he shattered all the dreams you had .
so come with me and see .
hey , little girl , i 'll make all your dreams come true !
come , little girl , i 'll make all your dreams come true !
