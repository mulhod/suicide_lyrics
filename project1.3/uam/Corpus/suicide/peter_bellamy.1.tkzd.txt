the ballad of henry & susannah , pt . 1

come all you gentle people and listen to my tale , concerning a poor convict .
from suffolk he did hail .
for fourteen years transported , as you shall understand for to lead a poor and wretched life upon van diemen 's land .
young henry cabell was his name , and in mendham he did dwell .
his poor but honest parents , they reared him right well till cruel hardship overcame them and his father in despair to feed his family did embark upon a wild career .
