# the end of our road

gotta get away from you fast as i can .
too much for me , baby , more than my heart can stand .
like a kid behind the wheel , you been reckless with my heart .
if i stay around , you 'll surely tear it all apart .
the road 's got to end somewhere .
every road has got to end somewhere .
now is the time for the showdown , so let me give you the low-down .
we 've come to the end of our road .
just think about all those nights you left me at home lonely .
you only did it because you knew i love you only .
running around with every girl in town , i 'm telling you , boy , no longer will i be your clown , saying the road 's got to end somewhere , saying every road has got to end somewhere .
sick and tired of your stuff , said enough is enough .
we 've come to the end of our road .
ai n't no sense in your begging and pleading , talking about i 'm not the one that you 're needing .
said i done had my fill of you .
hurt me so through the years , i 've done sure enough run out of tears .
telling you i could n't cry if i wanted to , said the road 's got to end somewhere .
well , now , every road has got to end somewhere .
time and again i beg you to slow down , so i 'm givin you the low-down .
we 've come to the end of our road .
