#i wo n't be there

you treat me mean and cruel .
i 'm such a fool for you .
you say you 're going to leave .
darling please do n't set me free .
maybe some day you 'll want me , and when you really want me , you 'll turn around .
i wo n't be there .
i know the boy you 're dreaming of tonight .
it just do n't quite seem right that he 's your guy .
oh , why do n't you think it over before you say it 's over .
forget he ever held you tight .
he 's only going to break your heart in two .
oh , it just ca n't be true that he 's your guy .
you left me once before to go with him , then he left you .
you came back to me again .
maybe some day you 'll miss me , and when you really miss me , you 'll turn around .
i wo n't be there .
you loved me for a while and set me free ?
what is my destiny if he 's your guy .
if he 's your guy .
if he 's your guy .
