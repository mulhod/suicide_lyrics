#roll down

sweet ladies of plymouth , we 're saying goodbye .
roll down !
but we 'll rock you and roll you again by and by .
walk her round , my brave boys and roll down !
and we will roll down !
walk her round , my brave boys and roll down !
now the anchor 's aweigh and the sails are unfurled , and we 're bound for to take her half-way round the world .
in the wide bay of biscay the seas will run high , and the poor sickly transports they 'll wish they could die .
when the wild coast of africa it do appear , the poor nervous transports they 'll tremble with fear .
when the cape of good hope it is rounded at last , the poor lonesome transports they 'll long for the past .
when the great southern whales on our quarter do spout , the poor simple transports they 'll goggle and shout .
and when we arrive off australia 's strand , the poor weary transports they 'll long for the land .
and when we set sail for old england 's shore , the poor stranded transports we 'll see them no more .
then sweet ladies of plymouth we 'll pay all your rent , and go roving no more till our money 's all spent .
