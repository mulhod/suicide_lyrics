#lost inside your love

what can i say ?
what can i do ?
all of my life i 've been a victim of you .
what can i say or do ?
lost inside your love .
what can it be ?
who can i see ?
all of your life you 've been the winner in me .
what can i say or do ?
lost inside your love .
is it any wonder , there 's no reason why ?
is it all because i left it open wide for your pride , to leave me one more time ?
are you leaving me one more time ?
what can i say ?
what can i do ?
all of my life i 've been a winner with you .
what can i say or do ?
lost inside your love .
lost inside your love .
lost inside your love .
