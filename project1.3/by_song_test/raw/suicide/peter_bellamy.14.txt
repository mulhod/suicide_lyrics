#The Humane Turnkey (2)

Now when I came to London, having rode two hundred mile, to see a turnkey nurse a babe, it cause the crowd to smile.
But hearing its sad history, it made the crowd to groan, and many a worthy citizen swore justice would be done.
Then up and spoke a gentleman and loudly did declare that only one man in the land could settle the affair.
So to Lord Sydney's house I went, the crowd did follow on, for they swore they would see Charity before the day was done.
When we came to Lord Sydney's house, it was the hour of nine.
We all came bursting in on him as he sat down to dine.
He listened to my story, and his countenance was grave, then declared that ere the week was out, the family would be saved.
Lord Sydney wrote two letters and he signed them with his hand, one to Plymouth, one to Norwich, bidding them to understand that young Cabell and the baby with Susannah were to go as a united family unto that distant shore.
Now I'm home again in Norwich but some other trade I'll seek as a coachman or a waggoner, a shopman or a sweep.
Perhaps I'll take the shilling or go wear the jacket blue.
There's no trade but it's the kinder, so locks and bars, adieu!
