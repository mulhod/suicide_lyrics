#Angelique

Angelique, your name is whispered by the passing breeze.
Proclaims your beauty to the tallest trees.
And you're mine, Angelique.
Angelique, you stand alone because none compares with you.
So far from those who try to be with you.
And you're mine, Angelique.
Angelique, your kiss is only like the morning dew.
You smile, the whole wide world, it smiles with you.
And you're mine, Angelique.
And you're mine, Angelique.
I'll never be with you,  never ever touch your hand.
So I'll just dream of you, lonely in my wonder land.
Angelique, when will I ever meet a girl like you?
And if I do, how will I know it's true, that you're mine, Angelique?
