#Look Out California 

Bags are packed.
Jumping on a jet today.
Feel so good because I'm getting back to the U.S.A.
Temperature's rising.
I'm flying back to the sun.
Hanging around old London town ain't good for too, too long.
Look out California.
I got to warn ya.
Look out solar city.
You're looking pretty to me, yeah, to me.
Feel so good, getting back to Rock-n-Roll.
So long since it felt so right to my very soul.
My temperature's rising because I'm laying back in the sun.
Kicking around old L.A. town.
Too much, too much good fun.
Look out California.
I got to warn ya.
Look out solar city.
You're looking pretty to me, yeah, to me.
Got a good deal from a prominent record man.
We're trying our hardest just to follow the plan.
Back on the airwaves.
Back in the airwaves.
Back on the airwaves.
Back, back in the airwaves.
Back, back in the airwaves.
Back, back in the airwaves.
Back, back in the airwaves, yeah.
Look out California.
Back, back in the airwaves.
I gotta warn ya.
Back, back in the airwaves.
Look out solar city.
Back, back in the airwaves.
You're looking pretty to me.
Back, back in the airwaves.
To me, to me, to me, yeah, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me.
