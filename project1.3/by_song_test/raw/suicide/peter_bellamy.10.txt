#The Ballad Of Henry and Susannah, Pt. 4 

For three long years and upward in that dark and bitter cell young Henry and Susannah they lovingly did dwell.
And in Seventeen and eighty six, she bore him a baby boy.
Who would believe that such a pit could ever hold such joy?
But sorrow quickly followed which did pierce them to the heart for the news was to them carried that their family must part.
Young Henry was to stay in jail, as he did understand, while Susannah she was to be sent to far Van Diemen's Land.
Down on his knees he pleaded, all from his breaking heart, that from his own dear loved ones he would not be forced to part.
But in that dreary dungeon young Henry had to stay as his sweetheart and his little son to Plymouth were conveyed.
