#The Black and Bitter Night

It is cold, sad, and lonely in this dismal cell.
No solace comes up with the day.
My heart knows an anguish that no tongue can tell since they've taken my true love away.
Oh, the black and bitter night, and oh, the weary day.
My love has been snatched far, far from my sight, and the transports will bear her away.
When first in this prison so deep was my pain.
Then she came and she banished dismay.
But now in despondence I'm drowning again, for they've taken my true love away.
Though surrounded by horrors, yet we found delight, for where love is, no sorrow can stay.
But misery and squalor swim back to my sight now they've taken my true love away
Why, the grasses still grow, and the streams still down flow, and the blackbird still sings on the spray.
But in dank, deary dungeons there's nothing but woe since they've taken my true love away.
Well, if I were a seagull, I'd fly to her side, and it's there that I wish I could stay.
But soon the cruel prison ships leave with the tide and they've bearing my true love away.
If I were a herring, I'd wait by the slip, though I waited a year and a day.
Then through the wide ocean I'd follow the ship that is bearing my true love away
So lovers, cling fast to each pleasure you find and cherish each moment of play, for all you will have is what stays in your mind once they've taken your true love away.
