#The Robber's Song

My name is Abe Carman.
My trade it is right charming, for you know there is no harm in a little burglary.
I live by taking chances, like the heroes of Romances, and taking what I fancies with bold audacity!
There's wealth all for the taking, and there is no mistaking, my fortune I am making with a little robbery.
No man shall be my master as long as I run faster than those that would me blast for taking things for free!
I've robbed the great and wealthy in manner sly and stealthy, but it's just to keep me healthy as you can plainly see.
No watch, no ring, no clock it is not safe within your pocket, and it will avail you naught to lock it from light-fingered gentry!
