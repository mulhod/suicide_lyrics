#Money 

Money stole my lady.
Fools have a way of making me lazy.
Money buy you freedom.
Rules have a way of making me crazy.
So we grow a little older with another tale to tell.
So we grow a little colder with another tale to tell.
Money make you feel unhappy.
Fools have a way of making me crazy.
So we grow a little older with another tale to tell.
So we grow a little colder with another tale to tell.
