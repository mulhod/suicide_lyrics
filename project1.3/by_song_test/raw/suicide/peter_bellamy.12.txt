#The Humane Turnkey (1)

"Come rise you up, John Simpson," the governor did say.
"These scum are chained and ready, and it's time you was away.
Three woman and a farthing child, to Plymouth they are bound,
And you must be their escort till they reach that distant town."
When me and these poor convicts did arrive at Plymouth strand, I marched them up onto the deck all chained hand to hand.
The captain saw us come aboard and he did prove unkind.
"The women come," he did declare, "But the infant stays behind."
This proud unfeeling seaman, Captain Gilbert was his name.
Oh, to see a babe abandoned so, I swore it was a shame.
I wrapped it up in my great-coat, to the coach I went straightway and I started out for London Town without no more delay.
