#Found Out About You

All last summer, in case you don't recall, I was yours and you were mine.
Forget it all.
Is there a line that I could write sad enough to make you cry?
All the lines you wrote to me were lies.
The months roll past. 
The love that you struck dead.
Did you love me only in my head?
Things you said and did to me seemed to come so easily.
The love I thought I'd won you give for free.
Whispers at the bus stop.
I heard about nights out in the school yard.
I found out about you.
Rumors follow everywhere you go.
Like when you left and I was last to know.
You're famous now, and there's no doubt.
In all the places you hang out they know your name, and know what you're about.
Whispers at the bus stop.
I heard about nights out in the school yard.
I found out about you.
Street lights blink on through the car window.
I get the time too often on AM radio.
You know it's all I think about.
I write your name. 
Drive past your house.
Your boyfriend's over. 
I watch your light go out.
Whispers at the bus stop.
I heard about nights out in the school yard.
I found out about you.
