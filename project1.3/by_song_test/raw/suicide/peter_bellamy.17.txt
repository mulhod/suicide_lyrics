#The Still and Silent Ocean

Across the still and the silent ocean our ship she finds her way alone.
The crew they make no loud commotion.
The chained transports they make no moan.
All black despair do lie behind us, and what awaits us no man may know.
Of those dark days naught can remind us.
New worlds are waiting to which we go.
Are we in chains? 
We do not feel them.
Are we ill-quartered? 
We don't complain.
Do we have guards? 
We do not see them.
Do we have sickness? 
We fell no pain.
For the night is passed.
New days are dawning.
Winter is over, and Spring draws nigh.
What's done is done.
There's no time for mourning.
What's lost is lost, and there's no time to sigh.
God bless those tender-hearted creatures who brought us back to our own again.
Good health to all whose kind deeds did reach us.
Good luck to them who did ease our pain.
Glad fortune come to Mrs. Jackson, to bold John Simpson and Lord Sydney too.
Almighty God, do spare and keep them, and grant them peace when their days are through.
Come all you poor benighted convicts.
Come join us in our present joy.
Come all you seamen who sail the tropics.
Rejoice with us that our goal is nigh.
When we're ashore the priest will wed us, as soon as we do reach the strand.
Salute the captain who here has led us to the hopeful pastures of Van Diemen's Land!
