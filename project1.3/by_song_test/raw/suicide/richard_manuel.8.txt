#Jawbone

Oh, Jawbone, when did you first go wrong?
Oh, Jawbone, where is it you belong?
Three time loser, you'll never learn, lay down your tools before you burn.
You keep on running and hiding your face, spreading your heat all over the place.
I'm a thief and I dig it!
I'm up on a beef, I'm gonna rig it!
I'm a thief and I dig it!
Oh, Jawbone, why don't you sit and moan?
Oh, Jawbone, you know that it's stone for stone.
Sneak through the night upon your toes.
To look in your eye, it never shows.
Your name upon the post office wall put you on edge because they wrote it too small!
Oh, Jawbone, revenge stays on your mind.
Oh, Jawbone, you been doing too much time.
Pull off a job with an inside man who needs the cash and likes your plan.
Then you will know just who to thank when you land right back in the tank.
Oh, Jawbone, why don't you go home?
Oh, Jawbone, where is it you belong?
Boosting and going out on the lam.
You know that you'll steal anything that you can.
Temptation stands just behind the door, so what you want to go and open it for?
