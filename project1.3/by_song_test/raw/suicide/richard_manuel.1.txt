#In a Station

Once I walked through the halls of a station.
Someone called your name.
In the streets I heard children laughing.
They all sound the same.
Wonder, could you ever know me, know the reason why I live? 
Is there nothing you can show me?
Life seems so little to give.
Once I climbed up the face of a mountain and ate the wild fruit there, fell asleep until the moonlight woke me and I could taste your hair.
Isn't everybody dreaming? 
Then the voice I hear is real.
Out of all the idle scheming, can't we have something to feel? 
Once upon a time they used me indeed.
Tomorrow never comes.
I could sing the sound of your laughter.
Still I don't know your name.
Must be some way to repay you out of all the good you gave.
If a rumour should delay you, love seems so little to say.
