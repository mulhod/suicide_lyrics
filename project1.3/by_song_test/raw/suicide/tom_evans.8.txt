#Sing for the Song

Words won't come together, and they're very hard to me.
Peace of mind is all I have to win.
Tuning doesn't matter just as long as I can sing.
Get myself together for the song, and we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
Yes, we'll all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
Now, I get to feeling that it may be just a dream.
May be just another foolish game.
As long as we all sing it when we have no time to think.
Have no time for bringing down our friends.
And we can all sing, sing for the song.
Yes, we'll all bring, bring it along.
Yes, we'll all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
