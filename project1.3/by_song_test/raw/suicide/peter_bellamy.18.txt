#The Ballad of Henry and Susannah, Pt. 5 

It was in the month of January Australia's coast drew near, and in that fair clime the sun did shine which filled their hearts with cheer.
And soon in peaceful Sydney Cove at anchor they did ride and admired the green and pleasant shore beyond the foaming tide.
Then up spoke Captain Philip, for so richly dressed was he: "Some man must bear me through the surf and keep me from the sea!"
Then up stepped Henry Cabell, being one both stout and tall, saying, "Captain, I will be that man and will not let you fall."
And so they sat them in the jolly boat, and the crew did pull for land.
And when they reached the shallows, Henry o'er the gunwale sprang.
He took the captain up on his back and he waded to the sand.
The very first of exiles in that distant part to stand.
And a fortnight later Henry took Susannah for his wife, the comfort of his darkest days to comfort him through life.
And when their years of sentence passed, their happiness did grow with property, prosperity and children also.
And so come all you gentle people who are lost in dark dismay, and remember that the blackest night must some time yield to day.
Remember that the wildest storm eventually must pass and, like Henry and Susannah, may you find your joy at last.
