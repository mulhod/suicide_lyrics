#Though I Know She Lies	    

When I look though your eyes, I tend to get bitter.
Maybe I'm best advised to look to myself.
I fall every time, though I know she lies.
I can't stay away. 
Stars would fall from the sky, and I won't forsake you. 
You've got lust in your heart. 
What's sad to me? 
I'll use every line, anything to make you mine. 
Keeping me in the dark. 
Wondering where you are.
Don't let me fall apart. 
You said take it slow, but I don't know. 
I don't know. 
Lying awake in the bed trying to cope with the feelings. 
I don't know if it's love, but what can I do?
I fall every time, though I know she lies. 
I can't stay away.
