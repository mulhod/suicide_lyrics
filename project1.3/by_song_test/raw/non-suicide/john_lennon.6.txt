#Cold Turkey

Temperature's rising, fever is high.
Can't see no future.
Can't see no sky.
My feet are so heavy, so is my head.
I wish I was a baby.
I wish I was dead.
Cold turkey has got me on the run.
Body is aching, goose pimple bone.
Can't see no body.
Leave me alone.
My eyes are wide open.
Can't get to sleep.
One thing I'm sure of, I'm at the deep freeze.
Cold turkey has got me on the run.
Cold turkey has got me on the run.
Thirty-six hours rolling in pain.
Praying to someone.
Free me again.
Oh, I'll be a good boy.
Please make me well.
I promise you anything.
Get me out of this hell.
