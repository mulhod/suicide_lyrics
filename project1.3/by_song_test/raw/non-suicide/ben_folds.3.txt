#Jesusland

Take a walk.
Out the gate you go and never stop, past dollar stores and wig shops, quarter in a cup for every block.
And watch the buildings grow smaller as you go down the tracks, beautiful McMansions on a hill that. overlook a highway with riverboat casinos and you still have yet to see a soul.
Jesusland, Jesusland.
Town to town, broadcast to each house, they drop your name, but no one knows your face.
Billboards quoting things you'd never say.
You hang your head and pray for Jesusland, Jesusland.
Miles and miles, and the sun going down.
Pulses glow from their homes.
You're not alone.
Lights come on as you lay your weary head on their lawn.
Parking lots, cracked and growing grass.
you see it all from offices to farms.
Crosses flying high above the malls.
A longer walk through Jesusland, Jesusland.
