#Mind Games

We're playing those mind games together, pushing the barriers, planting seeds, playing the mind guerrilla, chanting the Mantra peace on earth.
We all been playing those mind games forever, some kind of druid dudes lifting the veil, doing the mind guerrilla.
Some call it magic, the search for the grail.
Love is the answer and you know that for sure.
Love is a flower.
you got to let it grow.
So keep on playing those mind games together, faith in the future out of the now.
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas, absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind.
Yeah, we're playing those mind games together, projecting our images in space and in time.
Yes is the answer and you know that for sure.
Yes is surrender.
you got to let it go.
So keep on playing those mind games together, doing the ritual dance in the sun, millions of mind guerrillas putting their soul power to the karmic wheel.
Keep on playing those mind games together, raising the spirit of peace and love.
I want you to make love, not war.
I know you've heard it before.
