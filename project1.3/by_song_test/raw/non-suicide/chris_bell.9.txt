#There Was a Light	

There was a light so dear to me I wanted to live.
There was a time so near to me I asked you to give your life to me.
If it's a sign sent down to me, I'm asking you why it had to be. 
Spending all my time, waiting to die - what's the use? 
There was a light so dear to me I wanted to live. 
There was a time so dear to me I asked you to give your life to me.
