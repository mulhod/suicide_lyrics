#Eyes As Candles

My world is stirring sickly.
spits out our voices singing, "oh, no, no".
to kingdom come so slightly.
Here in the void in your place, I twitch and tweak an illusion to sit and stare so blankly until our hope is used up.
Why do I always seem to need you when you're fleeing?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done?
What have I lost that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?
Oh, hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
Some unguarded room.
a smoky figure fills me full, makes my head swell and ruin.
The family kneels at the pew.
They nod.
'We believe in what you're doing'.
I feel you rise above me, the western landscape's towering, and from my shell of a body the flowers blossom for picking.
Why do I always seem to need you when you're fleeing?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done?
what have I got that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?
Oh, hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
I've waited and waited for someone to take it
Don't fight it.
don't bother an inch for another.
Don't listen.
don't hear them.
they're in this together.
I've learned well.
now hear me.
there's much to be fearing.
I'm used to your absence, your faceless distraction.
I've painted your patterns, but found them attractive.
Now I've been leaning towards a life far more candid, though led through the dark with your eyes as my candles, where your life and my life's directions can wrangle and all of a sudden you've left me to handle the reasons that never forbid me to stand tall and somehow, oh, somehow I found out the secret to staying alive without actually breathing.
