#Going Back

In a foreign land there were creatures at play, running hand in hand, needing nowhere to stay, driven to the mountains high, they were sunken in the cities deep, living in my sleep.
I feel like going back, back where there's nowhere to stay, when fire filled the sky.
I'll still remember that day.
These rocks I'm climbing down have already left the ground, careening through space.
I used to build these buildings.
I used to walk next to you.
Their shadows tore us apart and now we do what we do.
Driven to the mountains high, sunken in the cities deep, living in our sleep.
I feel like going back, back where there's nowhere to stay.
