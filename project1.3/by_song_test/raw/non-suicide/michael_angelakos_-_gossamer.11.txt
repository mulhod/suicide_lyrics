#It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy

Sorry I couldn't be there, I was tied to a rocking chair.
I was beat down to a pulp, rocking back and forth somewhere.
If you knew, if you saw, you'd have said it was the final straw, that my life was bound and tethered on a porch by the shore.
But there is no easy way to tell them so, the things you know.
And run, they say.
They think they know exactly so.
It's not right, it's not right.
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we?
Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well, it's enough, it's just enough because we don't stand a chance.
So, long you stay around, you're just another song and dance.
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair.
Still I'm the only one who seems to care.
It's funny that being funny makes you feel like up and running when your past lingers like rain clouds, casting shadows below.
I could live with so many burdens.
I take all your hope and yearning, but there's no one I want to take me for that petty little rose.
I used to glow.
Once I had a love to show, a love they know.
They're slow, so slow that they never know where I go.
It's not right, it's not right.
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we?
Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well, it's enough, it's just enough because we don't stand a chance.
So, long you stay around, you're just another song and dance.
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair.
Still I'm the only one who seems to care.
I know that it's only something.
I'm just working with what I've been given.
It's not my fault, I'm happy.
Don't call me crazy, I'm happy.
It's not right, it's not right.
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we?
Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well, it's enough, it's just enough because we don't stand a chance.
So, long you stay around, you're just another song and dance.
It's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair.
Still I'm the only one who seems to care.
