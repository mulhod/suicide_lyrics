#Cry Like a Ghost

All on my own, where I found you alone, you were caught up in somebody else's mess and, yes, I drank all those drinks on my own.
My life's become some blurry little quest.
And the clock kept ticking slowly, and you leaned over to ask me if I even had a clue where I was.
Well, I lied down your wood floors, and my brain and body took course in the night and then, as though it never was.
It all began to feel the same.
I want to know where they keep the rain.
Sylvia, right back where you came from.
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb,
But, Sylvia, no one's going to tell you when enough's enough.
Enough is enough.
Sick to the bone on the steps to my home.
The moon shined through the drapery of leaves to her, to ignore everyone on my own, my true love, just to feel some made up breeze.
But, as my body crumbled, you walked as I just stumbled, and we spoke only of things made in my head.
You never once controlled me, what all the others told me that, if I kept on going, I'd be dead.
It's not just you who felt the pain.
Now, tell me where they keep the rain.
Sylvia, right back where you came from.
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb,
But, Sylvia, no one's going to tell you when enough's enough.
Enough is enough.
See what I've done now.
I don't understand
She says I screamed and that I raised my hand, but I never meant to.
Wasn't even there.
I never meant to.
I would never dare.
Sylvia, right back where you came from.
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb,
But, Sylvia, no one's going to tell you when enough's enough.
Enough's always too tough.
Sylvia, right back where you came from.
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb.
But, Sylvia, no one's going to tell you when enough's enough.
Enough is enough.
