#Make a Scene	      

You hurt me yesterday.
I didn't know what to say. 
You didn't have to be so mean. 
You didn't have to make a scene. 
You don't have to be so cruel. 
You made me feel like a fool. 
I heard some things about you. 
They said you was untrue. 
I told them.
Then why is it so? 
You hurt me yesterday.
I didn't know what to say. 
You didn't have to be so mean. 
You didn't have to make a scene. 
You don't have to act so cool. 
I know that you've been to school. 
I started to feel unloved. 
I had no place to go. 
I turned on the radio. 
You hurt me yesterday. 
I didn't know what to say. 
You didn't have to be so mean. 
You didn't have to make a scene. 
Don't have to be so cruel. 
Made me feel like a fool. 
I heard some things about you. 
They said you was untrue. 
I told them.
Then why is it so?
