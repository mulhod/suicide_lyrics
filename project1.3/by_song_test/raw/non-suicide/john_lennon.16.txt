#I Know (I Know)

The years have passed so quickly.
One thing I've understood: I am only learning to tell the trees from wood.
I know what's coming down and I know where it's coming from and I know and I'm sorry, yes, I am, but I never could speak my mind.
and I know just how you feel and I know now what I have done and I know and I'm guilty, but I never could speak my mind.
I know what I was missing, but now my eyes can see.
I put myself in your place as you did for me.
Today I love you more than yesterday.
Right now I love you more right now.
Now I know what's coming down.
I can feel where it's coming from and I know it's getting better all the time as we share in each other's minds.
