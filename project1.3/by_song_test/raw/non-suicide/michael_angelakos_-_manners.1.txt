Make Light

So now we see.
Comes burying my burnt remains.
These puddled clouds.
Oh I, I understand now.
But darkness falls likes shattered pieces, dangling, shimmering, torn and tattered and crowned.
Oh, I'll not be told "No" to no more.
You must believe to hear me sing these messy morsels of my self-assuring love.
Oh, it's painful kneading.
Yes, I lie and I wrangle with prospective angles that glare me down and face me with all I do wrong.
Why do they all look like me?
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh just to prove I'm alive.
And it's alright because tonight there's a way I'll make light of my treacherous life.
If I had hands, I'd hold up high my lofty dreams, my alibi's real name.
But I have no strength.
So I toss and I turn and I spit in the urn.
There's a ghost in your eye.
There is someone that knows more than I.
But I'm quick to deny.
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh just to prove I'm alive.
And it's alright because tonight there's a way I'll make light of my treacherous life.
Make light!
