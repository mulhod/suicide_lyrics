#Mirrored Sea

Well, he called the whole thing such a wild mistake.
He said he didn't mean no harm.
Well, it was a big to-do, but nothing else was new.
His past checkered like checkerboards in Central park.
You do good in the light and the bad in the dark.
Good men are scarce and few.
They're always passing through.
Oh, you mirrored sea.
Your waves, they're haunting me.
They're all I see.
Oh, let me be, you mirrored sea.
Your waves, they're haunting me.
Oh mirrored sea, leave me be.
Born with a chance that everybody takes, with all risk and hardly any reward.
Bounce off the walls of your teens like in a pinball machine.
Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life like overheard insults or a cheating wife and then it's down for the count, the lost that won't be found.
Oh, you mirrored sea.
Your waves, they're haunting me.
They're all I see.
Oh, let me be, you mirrored sea.
Your waves, they're haunting me.
Oh mirrored sea, leave me be.
Everyone's alone.
Oh, you mirrored sea.
Your waves, they're haunting me.
They're all I see.
Oh, let me be, you mirrored sea.
Your waves, they're haunting me.
Oh, mirrored sea, leave me be.
