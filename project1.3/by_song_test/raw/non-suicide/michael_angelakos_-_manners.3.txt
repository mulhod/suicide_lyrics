#Moth's Wings

Dear friend, as you know your flowers are withering, your mother's gone insane, your leaves have drifted away, but the clouds are clearing up and I've come reveling, burning incandescently like a bastard on the burning sea.
You're just like your father, buried deep under the water.
You're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes.
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown.
Come lay with me on the ground.
You come beating like moth's wings, spastic and violently, whipping me into a storm, shaking me down to the core, but you run away from me and you left me shimmering like diamond wedding rings spinning dizzily down on the floor.
You're just like your father, buried deep under the water.
You're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes.
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown.
Come lay with me on the ground.
