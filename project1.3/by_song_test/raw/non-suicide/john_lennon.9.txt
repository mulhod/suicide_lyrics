#Working Class Hero

As soon as you're born, they make you feel small by giving you no time instead of it all till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all. 
A working-class hero is something to be.
They hurt you at home, and they hit you at school.
They hate you if you're clever, and they despise a fool till you're so fucking crazy, you can't follow their rules.
A working-class hero is something to be.
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years, then they expect you to pick a career.
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear, a working class hero is something to be.
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV, and you think you're so clever and classless and free, but you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.
A working-class hero is something to be.
There's room at the top, they're telling you still, but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill.
A working-class hero is something to be.
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me.
