#Carried Away

Since my heart is golden, I've got sense to hold in.
Tempted just to make an ugly scene.
No, I'm not as proper.
My money's in copper.
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street.
Listen, I'm your friend, don't quote me, but not a friend worth noting.
Yes, please don't ever note me as your friend.
Who says we have cold hearts acting out our old parts?
Dance before my favorite little scene, oh, oh, oh, oh.
I get carried away, carried away from you, and I'm hoping and I'm praying because I'm sorry, sorry about that, sorry about things that I've said.
Always let it get to my head.
All your appeal, once again we'd feel higher education making sense.
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this.
Tell me what your point is in defense.
Listen, I don't really know you, and I don't think I want to, but I think I can fake it if you can.
Let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money.
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oh, oh, oh.
I get carried away, carried away from you, and I'm hoping and I'm praying because I'm sorry, sorry about that, sorry about things that I've said.
Always let it get to my head.
I get carried away, carried away from you, and I'm hoping and I'm praying because I'm sorry, sorry about that, sorry about things that I've said.
Always let it get to my head.
Wake up in the morning.
wake up in the evening.
Wake up when you want to because no one's really watching.
Wish you had something to say about it, but we all have problems.
We're all having problems and we all got something to say.
I get carried away, carried away from you, and I'm hoping and I'm praying because I'm sorry, sorry about that, sorry about things that I've said.
Always let it get to my head.
I get carried away, carried away from you, and I'm hoping and I'm praying because I'm sorry, sorry about that, sorry about things that I've said.
Always let it get to my head.
