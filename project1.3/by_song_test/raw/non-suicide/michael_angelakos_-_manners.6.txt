#Swimming in the Flood

My eyes have once again been proven wrong.
Your clouds, your blanket, and my pity song, hovering on your front lawn, carry on until it's gone.
What can I do?
The river's overrun.
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch, but the water's rising up.
Then I lie naked in a rampage in the flesh, face to face with the onset.
I forget everything that's ever made me.
rise again.
Now slowly leave my memory.
What can I do?
The river's overrun.
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch, but the water's rising up.
Now all my lovers raise their cups.
What can I do?
