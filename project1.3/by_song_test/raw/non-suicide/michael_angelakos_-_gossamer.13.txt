#Almost There

There are things you'll never learn, like there's nothing to hide from.
House of people at your door.
Give it away, they'll just take more.
But I don't know what you want, but I can't get it out of my brain.
Yeah, you're almost there.
There are things you'll never do, like even try to hurt me too.
God knows something more than ruin.
Put you down and blamed my moods.
All this talk - I swear, I can't get it out of my brain.
Yeah, you're almost there.
Yeah, you're almost there.
