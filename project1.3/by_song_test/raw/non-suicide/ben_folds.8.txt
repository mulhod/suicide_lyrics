#Late

Under some dirty words on a dirty wall, eating takeout by myself, I played the shows, got back in the van and put the Walkman on and you were playing.
In some other dive a thousand miles away, I played a thousand times before, and like pathetic stars, the truck stops and the rock club walls I always knew, you saw them too, but you never will again.
It's too late.
Don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
Elliott, man, you played a fine guitar and some dirty basketball.
The songs you wrote got me through a lot.
Just want to tell you that.
But it's too late.
It's too late.
No, don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
Oh no things were looking up, at least that's what I heard.
Oh no someone came and washed away your hard-earned peace of mind when desperate static beats the silence up, a quiet truth to calm you down.
The songs you wrote got me through a lot.
Just want to tell you that.
But it's too late.
It's too late.
No, don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
It's too late.
It's too late.
No, don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
