#Hideaway

Who could love you in the way that you love you?
You're alone, darling, and there's nothing to argue.
If your life evolves into ruin, everyone's watching all that you're doing.
Say your head's turning.
Maybe you should start running.
Hideaway, hideaway, where they'll never say you cannot stay.
Come and play, oh, my hideaway.
Someday everything will be okay.
You're not strong so you, you can hurt her so badly.
You don't mean to, hurting her is too maddening.
When you do, it's a war in your head.
What you mean to say isn't always worth saying.
Take a deep breath as soon as you let go.
Hideaway, hideaway, where they'll never say you cannot stay.
Come and play, oh, my hideaway.
Someday everything will be okay.
What's the point to this, feeling happiness in life?
As we fight off our demise, or love as we play into its lies, oh honey.
Hideaway, hideaway, where they'll never say you cannot stay.
Come and play, oh, my hideaway.
Someday everything will be okay.
