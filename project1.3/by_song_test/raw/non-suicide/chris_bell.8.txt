#I Got Kinda Lost

I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost in giving.
I got kind of lost.
And what can I say feeling the way I do?
I'm trying to get it across to you.
Only wanted to be together.
All the time that it was I saw her.
Things that I'd done before are gone.
I can't believe I'm on my own.
Once in a while, and I see you smile, but you don't know how it's going.
I'm trying to get it across to you.
Only wanted to be together.
All the time that it was I saw her.
Things that I'd done before are gone.
I can't believe I'm on my own.
I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost in giving.
I'm trying to get it across to you.
