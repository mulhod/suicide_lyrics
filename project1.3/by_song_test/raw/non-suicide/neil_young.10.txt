#Dreaming Man

I'm a dreaming man, yes, that's my problem.
I can't tell when I'm not being real.
In the meadow dusk I park my Aerostar with a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you.
I'll always be a dreaming man.
I don't have to understand.
I know it's alright.
I see your curves and I feel your vibrations, you dressed in black and white, you lost in the mall.
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations.
Another sleepless night, a sun that won't fall.
I'll always be a dreaming man.
I don't have to understand.
I know it's alright.
Now the night is gone, a new day is dawning, and our homeless dreams go back to the street.
Another time or place, another civilization would really make this life feel so complete.
I'll always be a dreaming man.
I don't have to understand.
I know it's alright.
Dreaming man, he's got a problem.
Dreaming man, dreaming man, he's got a problem.
Dreaming man.
