#Let Your Love Grow Tall

In pastures blue and green I'll follow you and you'll follow me, my fabric's mystery.
I'll wave your loyalty in the freezing breeze so desperately.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
I think I see my life.
He bows all slyly and gentle-like.
He's never had the right.
I've never lived without his sad and jealous eyes.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
They'd say, "let your love grow tall, let your love grow tall".
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?
Like the darkness in the forest?
Like my frightened worried eyes?
Or the roots in the soil?
Are skies telling lies?
But it's the thought that counts.
Quiet minds don't know their worth.
They know what to do, so I'll pray for them and I'll pray for you till my face turns blue.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
They'd say, "let your love grow tall, let your love grow tall".
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?
Like the darkness in the forest?
Like my frightened worried eyes?
Or the roots in the soil?
Are skies telling lies?
