Heart of Gold

I want to live.
I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give that keep me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old, keeps me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old.
I've been to Hollywood.
I've been to Redwood.
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold.
I've been in my mind.
it's such a fine line that keeps me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old, keeps me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old.
keep me searching for a heart of gold.
You keep me searching for a heart of gold and I'm growing old.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
