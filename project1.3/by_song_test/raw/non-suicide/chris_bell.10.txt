#Fight at the Table 

Had a fight at the table.
I didn't think it would end.
I Didn't think I'd be able to go on and pretend.
I been having a good time.
I didn't want you to go, she said. 
Got to leave her alone.
I started dreaming about Emma, and he said, "Don't interfere."
Said "What are you doing in Denver?
There no light in here".
Well, I been having a good time.
I didn't want you to go.
Why can't they stop all this jiving?
You don't want to know.
It must be getting past midnight, and now I'm staring to scream.
She really put up a good fight.
I think this must be a dream.
I been  having a good time.
Babe, I'm lost in the rain.
I told them just when I'm going.
I think I'm going insane.
