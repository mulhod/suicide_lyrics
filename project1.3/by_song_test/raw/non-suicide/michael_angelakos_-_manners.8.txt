#To Kingdom Come

That's a frosty way to speak, o tell me how to live next to your potpourri.
All this talking pulls my teeth.
I believed in you, so you believed in me.
I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
Once I had a name to claim.
I scraped on the walls like an orthodox saint.
I wish for the same old things that turn me inside out.
hearing is the strain.
it's a game.
Me, I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
Never have I ever been clutching at your hair to cure you of some sin, but that's the kind of state I'm in, swimming in a pool of godly medicine.
"Come, come," I hear it calling me, yelling like if ever there was someone who could make things heavenly again.
Feel alive.
Me, I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
Me, I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
