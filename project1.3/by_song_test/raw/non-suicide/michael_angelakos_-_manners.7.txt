#Folds in Your Hands

Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone.
i'm fine.
i'll be fine until the morning comes, then unmask me in the blistering sun.
Oh, let me go, just let me go, just let me go or i'll burst in front of your eyes, then collect myself from the ground.
And when i go, and when i go, just let me go like a light, flickering out in the skies, lost as fast as was found.
Everything's easy when you never have to choose.
with the balances shifting it refers to you.
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom.
i will crush our love, let it burn until i get to you.
Lay low.
don't let me know what is real.
we'll be quietly following you.
will they take me as their own?
now i will hold you.
i will keep you up and show my love until it folds in my hands, but i'll build it back to the top.
Everything's easy when you never have to choose.
with the balances shifting it refers to you.
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom.
i will crush our love, let it burn until i get to you.
Feel it rain, feel it rain, my love, feel it rain.
