Bastard

The old bastard left his ties and his suit, a brown box, mothballs and bowling shoes, and his opinion so you'd never have to choose.
Pretty soon, you'll be an old bastard too.
You get smaller while the world gets big.
The more you know you know you don't know shit.
The whiz-man'll never fit you like the whiz-kid did.
So why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Close your eyes, close your ears, young man.
You've seen and heard all an old man can.
Spread the facts on the floor like a fan.
Throw away the ones that make you feel bad.
Kids today getting old too fast.
They can't wait to grow up so they can get some ass.
They get nostalgic about the last ten years before the last ten years have passed.
So why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Tears land on a hand on a chest.
The old bastard had a paradigm arrest.
He got smaller and the world got big.
The more he knew he knew we didn't know shit.
The whiz-man never fit him.
the whiz-kid did.
So why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
