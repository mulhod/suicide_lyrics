#Crippled Inside

You can shine your shoes and wear a suit.
You can comb your hair and look quite cute.
You can hide your face behind a smile.
One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside.
You can wear a mask and paint your face.
You can call yourself the human race.
You can wear a collar and a tie.
One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside .
Well, now, you know that your cat has nine lives, nine lives to itself, but you only got one and a dog's life ain't fun.
Mama, take a look outside .
You can go to church and sing a hymn.
You can judge me by the color of my skin.
You can live a lie until you die.
One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside .
