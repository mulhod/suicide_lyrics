#Look Up	  

Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
Look up.
Look up.
He's the life waiting to love you, wanting to reach you.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
The man walking down the street keeps his head down low.
Doesn't look up, wants to give up.
He just keeps on looking down, staring at the ground.
Standing here at the corner I'm watching him walk away.
Standing here and I don't know why, but I'm thinking it could be a great day.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
Oh, I wish you knew him.
He's been waiting for so long.
If you look up, you'll see him.
You know we're all alone.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
Look up.
Look up.
He's the life waiting to love you, wanting to reach you.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
