#You To Thank

By the time the buzz was wearing off, we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot Nevada sun.
Kids piled high, and our moms and dads shook hands in a party of Polaroid friends, rented a pool and hired a band.
Maybe they knew more then we knew because they danced and drank while we jumped off the deep end.
Oh I've got you to thank for this.
Christmas came around, yeah, and everything was going to crap and our moms and dads not a clue to be had.
Yeah, we put on a pretty good act and they seemed to all need to believe it, so we danced and smiled and paddled hard beneath it.
Oh I've got you to thank for this.
You can't say you've never had a doubt and smoked it down but really wanted out.
By the time the buzz was wearing off, we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot Nevada sun.
And they won't fade.
I've got you to thank.
