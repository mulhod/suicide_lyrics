# i 'll be alright

can you remember ever having any fun ? because , when it 's all said and done , i always believed we were , but now i 'm not so sure oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh
i drink a gin and take a couple of my pills and my parade will give you chills .
oh , honey , do n't give me up , oh , oh , oh , oh
i know we 've had enough .
you should go if you want to .
yeah , go if you want to .
i 'll be alright , be alright .
well , i 've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless .
your whole life 's been nothing but this .
i wo n't let you go unless i 'll be alright .
i 'll be alright .
i 'm so self-loathing that it 's hard for me to see reality from what i dream .
no , no one believes me - no , not a single thing .
my brain is racing and i feel like i 'll explode .
you 're looking at me from below .
this world was n't made for you .
just go find someone new .
you should go if you want to .
yeah , go if you want to .
i 'll be alright , be alright .
well , i 've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless .
your whole life 's been nothing but this .
i wo n't let you go unless i 'll be alright .
i 'll be alright .
why do i keep holding onto suffering ?
heads gone on now , walls , my thoughts are stumbling
this party is over now .
it is n't happening
the wind in the sails could tell i 'm only recovering .
you should go if you want to .
yeah , go if you want to .
i 'll be alright , be alright .
well , i 've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless .
your whole life 's been nothing but this .
i wo n't let you go unless i 'll be alright .
i 'll be alright .
