#give judy my notice

judy , could anyone be loved anymore than i love you ?
does it hurt you too ?
but judy , i 've been feeling small too long .
i love you so , but something 's wrong .
and i come running when you want me here .
and when you want me to , i disappear .
give judy my notice .
i knew if i made it easy for you , you 'd settle for me , yeah eventually .
but judy , i wo n't be your bitch anymore and follow you around and hold the door .
and i ca n't do this any longer .
the vacuum left is so much stronger .
give judy my notice .
give judy my notice .
judy you know i 'm not mad anymore , at least most of the time , but that could take a while .
i 've been living just to see you smile every once in a while .
tears fall , but that do n't mean nothing at all .
it 's just because i said it first .
yeah , that 's why it hurts .
and i 'm not sorry if you 're not sorry .
and you 're not sorry until i make you .
give judy my notice .
