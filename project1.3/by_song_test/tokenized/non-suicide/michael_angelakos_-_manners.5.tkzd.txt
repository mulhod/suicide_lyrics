#eyes as candles

my world is stirring sickly .
spits out our voices singing , "oh , no , no" .
to kingdom come so slightly .
here in the void in your place , i twitch and tweak an illusion to sit and stare so blankly until our hope is used up .
why do i always seem to need you when you 're fleeing ?
where do you go when i 'm around ?
what have i done ?
what have i lost that 's so defeating ?
and have the nerve to wear a crown ?
oh , hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
some unguarded room .
a smoky figure fills me full , makes my head swell and ruin .
the family kneels at the pew .
they nod .
' we believe in what you 're doing ' .
i feel you rise above me , the western landscape 's towering , and from my shell of a body the flowers blossom for picking .
why do i always seem to need you when you 're fleeing ?
where do you go when i 'm around ?
what have i done ?
what have i got that 's so defeating ?
and have the nerve to wear a crown ?
oh , hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
i 've waited and waited for someone to take it
do n't fight it .
do n't bother an inch for another .
do n't listen .
do n't hear them .
they 're in this together .
i 've learned well .
now hear me .
there 's much to be fearing .
i 'm used to your absence , your faceless distraction .
i 've painted your patterns , but found them attractive .
now i 've been leaning towards a life far more candid , though led through the dark with your eyes as my candles , where your life and my life 's directions can wrangle and all of a sudden you 've left me to handle the reasons that never forbid me to stand tall and somehow , oh , somehow i found out the secret to staying alive without actually breathing .
