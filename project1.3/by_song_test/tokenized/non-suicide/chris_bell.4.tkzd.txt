#get away

i know what it is you 're thinking , but baby , it 's sacred to me .
whenever i feel like i 'm sinking , you make a beautiful scene .
you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
baby , i 'm feeling low .
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
do n't know what you 're putting me through .
once in a while you 're lonely .
if you feel lonely , cry .
i 'd love to know what is the matter , unless you 're with some other guy , because you do n't lie to me and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
baby , i 'm feeling low .
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
do you want to ?
i want you .
do you want to ?
i want you too .
do n't you know i 'm losing sleep at night , sleep at night ?
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i know what it is you 're thinking , but baby , it 's strange to me .
whenever i feel like i 'm sinking , you make a beautiful scene .
do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
and , baby , i 'm feeling low .
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
do n't know what you 're putting me through .
