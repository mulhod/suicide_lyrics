bastard

the old bastard left his ties and his suit , a brown box , mothballs and bowling shoes , and his opinion so you 'd never have to choose .
pretty soon , you 'll be an old bastard too .
you get smaller while the world gets big .
the more you know you know you do n't know shit .
the whiz-man 'll never fit you like the whiz-kid did .
so why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
close your eyes , close your ears , young man .
you 've seen and heard all an old man can .
spread the facts on the floor like a fan .
throw away the ones that make you feel bad .
kids today getting old too fast .
they ca n't wait to grow up so they can get some ass .
they get nostalgic about the last ten years before the last ten years have passed .
so why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
tears land on a hand on a chest .
the old bastard had a paradigm arrest .
he got smaller and the world got big .
the more he knew he knew we did n't know shit .
the whiz-man never fit him .
the whiz-kid did .
so why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
