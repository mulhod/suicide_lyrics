#april come she will

april come she will when streams are ripe and swelled with rain .
may she will stay resting in my arms again .
june she 'll change her tune .
in restless walks she 'll prowl the night .
july she will fly and give no warning to her flight .
august die she must .
the autumn winds blow chilly and cold .
september i remember a love once new has now grown old .
