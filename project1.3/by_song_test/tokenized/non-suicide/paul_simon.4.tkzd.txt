#kathy 's song

i hear the drizzle of the rain .
like a memory it falls , soft and warm continuing , tapping on my roof and walls .
and from the shelter of my mind through the window of my eyes , i gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets to england where my heart lies .
my mind 's distracted and diffused .
my thoughts are many miles away .
they lie with you when you 're asleep and kiss you when you start your day .
and as a song i was writing is left undone , i do n't know why i spend my time writing songs i ca n't believe with words that tear and strain to rhyme .
and so you see i have come to doubt all that i once held as true .
i stand alone without beliefs .
the only truth i know is you .
and as i watch the drops of rain weave their weary paths and die .
i know that i am like the rain .
there but for the grace of you go i .
