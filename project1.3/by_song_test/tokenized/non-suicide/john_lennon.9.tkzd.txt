#working class hero

as soon as you 're born , they make you feel small by giving you no time instead of it all till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all .
a working-class hero is something to be .
they hurt you at home , and they hit you at school .
they hate you if you 're clever , and they despise a fool till you 're so fucking crazy , you ca n't follow their rules .
a working-class hero is something to be .
when they 've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years , then they expect you to pick a career .
when you ca n't really function , you 're so full of fear , a working class hero is something to be .
keep you doped with religion and sex and tv , and you think you 're so clever and classless and free , but you 're still fucking peasants as far as i can see .
a working-class hero is something to be .
there 's room at the top , they 're telling you still , but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill .
a working-class hero is something to be .
if you want to be a hero , well , just follow me .
