#better save yourself

i 'm off the street .
i 'm all alone .
i just ca n't think what i 've been doing wrong .
i know you 're mine .
he treats you nice .
it 's suicide .
i know , i tried it twice .
you should 've given your love to jesus .
it could n't do you no harm .
should 've given your love to jesus .
it would n't do you no harm .
you 've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace , but you better save yourself if you want to see his face .
i guess there are things you 'd like to know .
it 's getting late , and i know you want to go .
you should 've given your love to jesus .
it could n't do you no harm .
should 've given your love to jesus .
it would n't do you no harm .
you 've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace , but you better save yourself if you want to see his face .
i 'm off the street .
i 'm all alone .
i just ca n't think what i 've been doing wrong .
