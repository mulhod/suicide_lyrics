#make a scene

you hurt me yesterday .
i did n't know what to say .
you did n't have to be so mean .
you did n't have to make a scene .
you do n't have to be so cruel .
you made me feel like a fool .
i heard some things about you .
they said you was untrue .
i told them .
then why is it so ?
you hurt me yesterday .
i did n't know what to say .
you did n't have to be so mean .
you did n't have to make a scene .
you do n't have to act so cool .
i know that you 've been to school .
i started to feel unloved .
i had no place to go .
i turned on the radio .
