#dreaming man

i 'm a dreaming man , yes , that 's my problem .
i ca n't tell when i 'm not being real .
in the meadow dusk i park my aerostar with a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you .
i 'll always be a dreaming man .
i do n't have to understand .
i know it 's alright .
i see your curves and i feel your vibrations , you dressed in black and white , you lost in the mall .
i watch you disappear past club med vacations .
another sleepless night , a sun that wo n't fall .
i 'll always be a dreaming man .
i do n't have to understand .
i know it 's alright .
now the night is gone , a new day is dawning , and our homeless dreams go back to the street .
another time or place , another civilization would really make this life feel so complete .
i 'll always be a dreaming man .
i do n't have to understand .
i know it 's alright .
dreaming man , he 's got a problem .
dreaming man , dreaming man , he 's got a problem .
dreaming man .
