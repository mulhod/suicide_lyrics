#look out for my love

there 's a lot to learn for wasting time .
there 's a heart that burns .
there 's an open mind .
look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love .
you own it , you own it now .
you own it .
there 's a weight on you , but you ca n't feel it .
living like i do , it 's hard for you to see it .
was i hurt too bad ?
can i show you daylight ?
how could i be sad when i know that you might ?
look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love .
look out for my love .
it 's in your neighborhood .
i know things are going to change , but i ca n't say bad or good .
silver wings of morning shining in the gray day while the ice is forming on a lonely runway .
hydraulic wipers pumping till the window glistens .
something saying something .
no one seems to listen .
men with walkie-talkies , men with flashlights waving .
up upon the tower time reads daylight savings .
i 'm home again to you , babe .
you know it makes me wonder , sitting in the quiet slipstream in the thunder .
look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love .
