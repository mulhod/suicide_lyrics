#you to thank

by the time the buzz was wearing off , we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot nevada sun .
kids piled high , and our moms and dads shook hands in a party of polaroid friends , rented a pool and hired a band .
maybe they knew more then we knew because they danced and drank while we jumped off the deep end .
oh i 've got you to thank for this .
christmas came around , yeah , and everything was going to crap and our moms and dads not a clue to be had .
yeah , we put on a pretty good act and they seemed to all need to believe it , so we danced and smiled and paddled hard beneath it .
oh i 've got you to thank for this .
you ca n't say you 've never had a doubt and smoked it down but really wanted out .
by the time the buzz was wearing off , we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot nevada sun .
and they wo n't fade .
i 've got you to thank .
