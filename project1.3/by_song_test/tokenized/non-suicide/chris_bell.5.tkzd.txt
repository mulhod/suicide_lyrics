#you and your sister

they say my love for you ai n't real , but they do n't know how real it feels .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
your sister says that i 'm no good .
you know i 'd show her them if i could .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
love you every day .
let me hear you say your love wo n't be leaving .
your eyes ai n't deceiving .
love you every day .
let me hear you say : all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
and let me whisper in your ear : do n't you worry , they ca n't hear .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
if you give me a little time , i will show you i ai n't lying .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
