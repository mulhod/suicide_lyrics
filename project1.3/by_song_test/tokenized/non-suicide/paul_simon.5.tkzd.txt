#somewhere they ca n't find me

i can hear the soft breathing of the girl that i love as she lies here beside me , asleep with the night .
her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow , reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight .
but i 've got to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway .
before they come to catch me , i 'll be gone somewhere they ca n't find me .
oh baby , you do n't know what i 've done .
i 've committed a crime , i 've broken the law .
while you were here sleeping and just dreaming of me , i held up and robbed a liquor store .
but i 've got to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway .
before they come to catch me , i 'll be gone somewhere they ca n't find me .
oh my life seems unreal , my crime an illusion , a scene badly written in which i must play .
and though it puts me uptight to leave you , i know it 's not right to leave you when morning is just a few hours away .
but i 've got to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway .
before they come to catch me , i 'll be gone somewhere they ca n't find me .
