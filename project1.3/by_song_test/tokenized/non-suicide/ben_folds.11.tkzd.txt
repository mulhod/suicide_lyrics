#prison food

you walked the earth , talked and never spoke a word .
she wonders who will be the first to go .
i said you know , the biggest things we got to face alone .
do n't want to waste time and go .
alone alone again .
alone alone again .
a trace of me , it floats in my periphery and , every time i turn to see , it goes .
alone alone again lone alone again .
alone alone again .
floating by like a satellite to pass the time , you 'll float by again and i can tell you about the little . things so you do n't think about the big things for a while .
you walked the earth , talked and never spoke a word .
she wonders who will be the first to go .
alone alone again .
alone alone again .
alone alone again .
alone alone again alone .
