#found out about you

all last summer , in case you do n't recall , i was yours and you were mine .
forget it all .
is there a line that i could write sad enough to make you cry ?
all the lines you wrote to me were lies .
the months roll past .
the love that you struck dead .
did you love me only in my head ?
things you said and did to me seemed to come so easily .
the love i thought i 'd won you give for free .
whispers at the bus stop .
i heard about nights out in the school yard .
i found out about you .
rumors follow everywhere you go .
like when you left and i was last to know .
you 're famous now , and there 's no doubt .
in all the places you hang out they know your name , and know what you 're about .
whispers at the bus stop .
i heard about nights out in the school yard .
i found out about you .
street lights blink on through the car window .
i get the time too often on am radio .
you know it 's all i think about .
i write your name .
drive past your house .
your boyfriend 's over .
i watch your light go out .
whispers at the bus stop .
i heard about nights out in the school yard .
i found out about you .
