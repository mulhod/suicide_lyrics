# the green fields of england

farewell to our lovers and our kind relations .
farewell to the homes we love well .
there is never an ending to our tribulations , for they 've damned us like sinners to hell .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
from devon , from derby , from wiltshire and wales , from norwich , from newark and frome , we are herded together from verminous jails and like vermin are forced from our homes .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's cheats and cut-purses and rogues with no name .
there 's swindlers and sheep-stealers bold .
there 's poor poaching fellows took nothing but game , and there 's footpads took nothing but gold !
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's coiners and clippers and ladies of pleasure .
there 's dicers and drunkards and whores .
there 's butchers and bakers who dealt in short measures , and a few who have broken no laws .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's some who expected to go to the scaffold .
there 's others who thought to go free .
but now one and all in the hulks lie shackled , and together must plough the salt sea .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's some of our number are handsome and hearty .
there 's others the voyage will mend .
but there 's never a soul of our miserable party will live to see england again .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
so farewell to all judges so kind and forgiving .
farewell to your prisons and cells .
for though me must leave all that makes life worth living , we are leaving you bastards as well !
