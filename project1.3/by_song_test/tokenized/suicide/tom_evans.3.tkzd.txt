#angelique

angelique , your name is whispered by the passing breeze .
proclaims your beauty to the tallest trees .
and you 're mine , angelique .
angelique , you stand alone because none compares with you .
so far from those who try to be with you .
and you 're mine , angelique .
angelique , your kiss is only like the morning dew .
you smile , the whole wide world , it smiles with you .
and you 're mine , angelique .
and you 're mine , angelique .
i 'll never be with you , never ever touch your hand .
so i 'll just dream of you , lonely in my wonder land .
angelique , when will i ever meet a girl like you ?
and if i do , how will i know it 's true , that you 're mine , angelique ?
