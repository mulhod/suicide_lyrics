# whispering pines

if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream , here inside my lonely room there is no in between .
if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream , inside my lonely room there is no in between .
whispering pines , rising of the tide .
if only one star shines , that 's just enough to get inside .
i will wait until it all goes around .
with you in sight the lost are found .
foghorn through the night , calling out to sea .
protect my only light for she once belonged to me .
let the waves rush in , let the seagulls cry for , if i live again , these hopes will never die .
i can feel you standing there , but i do n't see you anywhere .
standing by the well , standing by the well , wishing for the rains , wishing for the rains , reaching to the clouds , reaching to the clouds for nothing else remains .
drifting in a daze when evening will be done , try looking through a haze at an empty house in the cold , cold sun .
i will wait until it all goes around .
with you in sight the lost are found .
