#pieces of the night

is it any wonder that the stars just do n't rush by when you 're only doing 60 through this oh so vacant night ?
but it 's lacking something big this time .
what the hell did you expect to find , aphrodite on a barstool by your side ?
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
and is it any wonder in the middle of the crowd you let your feet get trampled on when the music is that loud .
but you wanted to be where you are , but it looked much better from afar .
a hillside in shadow between the people and the stars .
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
it seems so distant , but still only half the night away where notions between your questions come too .
is it any wonder where the pieces of the night have been ?
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
only pieces of the night .
then i saw .
only pieces of the night .
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
