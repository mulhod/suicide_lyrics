#lost horizons

the last horizons i can see are filled with bars and factories , and in them all we fight to stay awake .
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again .
drunk , drunk , drunk in the gardens and the graves .
she had nothing left to say , so she said she loved me .
i stood there grateful for the lie .
drink enough of anything to make this girl look new again .
drunk , drunk , drunk in the gardens and the graves .
turn summer trees to bones and ice .
turn insect songs against the night with words we build and words we break .
i 'm drunk , drunk , drunk in the gardens and the graves .
maybe i could use you to reassure myself .
i would n't wish this indecision on anybody else .
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again .
and when the sin smiles , how could it be wrong ?
the last horizons i could see are not resigned to memories .
i never thought i 'd still be here today .
drink enough of anything to make myself look new again .
drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves .
