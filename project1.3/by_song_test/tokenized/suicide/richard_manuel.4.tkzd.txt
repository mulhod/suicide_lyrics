#katie 's been gone

katie 's been gone since the spring time .
she wrote one time and sent her love .
katie 's been gone for such a long time now .
i wonder what kind of love she 's thinking of .
dear katie , if you can hear me , i ca n't wait to have you near me .
dear katie , since you caught that bus , well , i do n't know how things are with us .
i 'm still here and you 're out there .
katie laughed when i said i was lonely .
she said , " there 's no need to feel that way " .
katie said that i was her only one , but then i wonder why she did n't wanna stay .
dear katie , if i 'm the only one , how much longer will you be gone ?
oh , katie , wo n't you tell me straight , how much longer do i have to wait ?
i 'll believe you , but please come through .
i know it 's wrong to be apart this long .
you should be here , near me .
katie 's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind .
she 's gone to find some newer places , left the old life far behind .
dear katie , do n't you miss your home ?
i do n't see why you had to roam .
dear katie , since you 've been away , i lose a little something every day .
i need you here , but you 're still out there .
dear katie , please drop me a line .
just write , love , to tell me you 're fine .
oh , katie , if you can hear me , i just ca n't wait to have you near me .
i can only think , where are you , what you do , maybe there 's someone new .
