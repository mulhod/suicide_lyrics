hey jealousy

tell me , do you think it 'd be all right if i could just crash here tonight ?
you can see i 'm in no shape for driving , and anyway i 've got no place to go .
and you know it might not be that bad .
you were the best i 'd ever had .
if i had n't blown the whole thing years ago i might not be alone .
tomorrow we can drive around this town , and let the cops chase us around .
the past is gone , but something might be found to take its place .
hey jealousy .
hey jealousy .
hey jealousy .
hey jealousy .
and you can trust me not to think , and not to sleep around .
if you do n't expect too much from me , you might not be let down beause all i really want is to be with you , and feel like i matter too .
if i had n't blown the whole thing years ago , i might be here with you .
tomorrow we can drive around this town , and let the cops chase us around .
the past is gone , but something might be found to take its place .
