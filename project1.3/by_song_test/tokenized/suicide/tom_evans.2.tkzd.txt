#beautiful and blue

she looks out of her window at the people passing by .
they look so happy .
makes her cry .
she watches them laughing .
sees the lovers holding hands , and everyone each other 's friends .
beautiful and blue , they 're not as good as you .
beautiful and blue , they 're lonely too .
she feels so unhappy .
she no longer cares for life and is close to ending all her strifes .
the world does n't know her .
it 's so hard and cold and cruel .
she wonders why she 's such a fool .
beautiful and blue .
beautiful and blue .
