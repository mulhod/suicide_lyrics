#king of the load he 's the king of the road , the old man , the child . 
the joker run wild , make it funny . 
he 's of no fix abide . 
when he carry the load , he 'll do anything he can to make it funny . 
but he 'll never say die if he 's live a lie . 
pick up he hat and go . 
if there 's reason to cry , he 'll just make it a sigh , and wander on down the road . 
he 's a natural friend with the money to lend , or whatever it take to turn you on , too . 
he 's the father , the son . 
he do n't owe anyone . 
all he debt be all pay with he confection . 
then he 'll wander away with no time in he way . 
pick up he hat and go . 
he 'll never say die if he 's live a lie . 
just wander on down the road , wander on down the road . 
and he 'll wander away with no time in he way . 
pick up he hat and go . 
he never say die . 
he be live a lie . 
just wander on down the road , wander on down the road , wander on down the road .
