#sing for the song word wo n't come together , and they 're very hard to me . 
peace of mind be all i have to win . 
tune do n't matter just as long as i can sing . 
get me together for the song , and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along . 
yes , we 'll all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .

and we can all sing , sing for the song . 
yes , we 'll all bring , bring it along .

and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along . 
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along . 
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
