#lost horizon the last horizon i can see be fill with bar and factory , and in they all we fight to stay awake . 
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again . 
drink , drink , drink in the garden and the grave . 
he have nothing leave to say , so he say he love me . 
i stand there grateful for the lie . 
drink enough of anything to make this girl look new again . 
drink , drink , drink in the garden and the grave . 
turn summer tree to bone and ice . 
turn insect song against the night with word we build and word we break . 
i 'm drink , drink , drink in the garden and the grave . 
maybe i can use you to reassure me . 
i will n't wish this indecision on anybody else . 
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again . 
and when the sin smile , how can it be wrong ? 
the last horizon i can see be not resign to memory . 
i never think i 'd still be here today . 
drink enough of anything to make me look new again . 
drink drink drink in the garden and the grave .
