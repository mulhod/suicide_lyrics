if i think it will do any good , i 'd stand on the rock where moses ... # whisper pine if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream , here inside me lonely room there be no in between . 
if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream , inside me lonely room there be no in between . 
whisper pine , rise of the tide . 
if only one star shine , this 's just enough to get inside . 
i will wait until it all go around . 
with you in sight the lose be find . 
foghorn through the night , call out to sea . 
protect me only light for he once belong to me . 
let the wave rush in , let the seagull cry for , if i live again , this hope will never die . 
i can feel you stand there , but i do n't see you anywhere . 
stand by the well , stand by the well , wish for the rain , wish for the rain , reach to the cloud , reach to the cloud for nothing else remain . 
drift in a daze when even will be do , try look through a haze at an empty house in the cold , cold sun . 
i will wait until it all go around . 
with you in sight the lose be find .
