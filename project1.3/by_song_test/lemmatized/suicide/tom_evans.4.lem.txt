#maybe tomorrow listen to a lonely sound . 
see the grey and sadness all around . 
see the people go they way . 
care not of me and the love i 've lose today . 
maybe tomorrow i will love again . 
i 'll never know until i 've look into he eye . 
maybe tomorrow i will love again . 
i 'll never know until i 've see he once or twice . 
and so i 'm live for a dream . 
each lonely day spend look for the sunshine . 
i 'll make believe this i do n't care . 
i 'll tell me friend i love me life . 
i 'm happy . 
maybe tomorrow i will love again . 
i 'll never know until i 've look into he eye . 
maybe tomorrow i will love again . 
i 'll never know until i 've see he once or twice . 
wherever , whoever you may be , let the light of you love shine through the window of me heart . 
then when you 've color all me thought bright , do n't let me ever ever think of night , no yeah ! 
maybe tomorrow you will love again . 
i 'll never know until i 've look into he eye . 
maybe tomorrow you will love again . 
i 'll never know until i 've see he once or twice . 
maybe tomorrow you will love again .
