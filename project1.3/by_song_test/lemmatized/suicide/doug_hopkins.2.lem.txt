#found out about you all last summer , in case you do n't recall , i be you and you be me . 
forget it all . 
be there a line this i can write sad enough to make you cry ? 
all the line you write to me be lie . 
the month roll past . 
the love this you strike dead . 
do you love me only in me head ? 
thing you say and do to me seem to come so easily . 
the love i think i 'd win you give for free . 
whisper at the bus stop . 
i hear about night out in the school yard . 
i find out about you . 
rumor follow everywhere you go . 
like when you leave and i be last to know . 
you 're famous now , and there 's no doubt . 
in all the place you hang out they know you name , and know what you 're about . 
whisper at the bus stop . 
i hear about night out in the school yard . 
i find out about you . 
street light blink on through the car window . 
i get the time too often on be radio . 
you know it 's all i think about . 
i write you name . 
drive past you house . 
you boyfriend 's over . 
i watch you light go out . 
whisper at the bus stop . 
i hear about night out in the school yard . 
i find out about you .
