# the leave in the woodland oh the grass in the meadow , the reed by the mere , the sad boom of the bittern be all this i hear . 
and the leave in the woodland and the gull by the shear cry : you never shall sit by you love one no more . 
when i be a young girl the world do seem gay , but this cruel hard time do drive comfort away . 
and the leave in the woodland and the gull by the shear cry : you never shall dance with you sweetheart no more . 
once i gather wild flower in the sweet countryside , but me garland have wither . 
me posy have die . 
and the leave in the woodland and the gull by the shear cry : you never shall lie by you husband no more . 
once i wend a-courting , but now me man 's go . 
once i be a mother , but now i 'm alone . 
and the leave in the woodland and the gull by the shear cry : you never shall walk with you menfolk no more . 
come all you young woman this 's free from all care . 
do n't you ever get marry , all sorrow lie there . 
for the leave in the woodland and the gull by the shear cry : the heart this be give no man may restore . 
now the field be all empty . 
the hedgerow be bare . 
only wild desolation be all i find there . 
i 'll go down to the river to ease all me pain , and who know , but i may find me dear one again .
