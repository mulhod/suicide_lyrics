#i once live in service i once live in service to a lady so fine . 
i 've serve he by night and by day . 
i 've carry the dish when the lady will dine , and after , i clear they away . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant be all slavery . 
i 've make up he be , and i turn down he sheet . 
i ironed the dress he wear . 
i 've peel he potato . 
i 've roast he meat . 
and it be i , with me broom , sweep he floor . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant be all misery . 
i scrub he front doorstep. 
i polish he plate . 
i put coal in the pan for he be . 
i 've rise before sunlight to blacklead he grate , and at midnight i 've lay down me head . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant be all drudgery . 
i 've carry he water . 
i 've answer he door . 
i 've polish the shoe for he foot . 
and when he wend to church , then he prayer-book i bear behind as he march down the street . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant 's a penance to me . 
now , i meet a young man in the village one day as i run to the shop for he bread . 
he 's ask me me name , but i have to away lest me mistress should break me poor head . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant have no liberty . 
so this night as i lie in me attic so bare , i resolve this i will run away . 
and all for to honor the waggoner 's fare , some silver spoon take for me pay . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant be melancholy . 
now i lie in prison but i will not weep. who know what tomorrow may hold ? 
there 's some fine lad in here for me company to keep. there 's strong arm to keep me from cold . 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a convict be all chivalry ! 
now i 've know confinement the more of me year . 
small freedom do i ever know . 
some prison , sure , they have no cold iron bar , but some prison , why , they have no man ! 
oh dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a convict 's a pleasure to me . 
dear me , how can it be ? 
the life of a servant be never so free !
