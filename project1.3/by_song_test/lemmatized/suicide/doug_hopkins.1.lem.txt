hey jealousy tell me , do you think it 'd be all right if i can just crash here tonight ? 
you can see i 'm in no shape for drive , and anyway i 've get no place to go . 
and you know it may not be this bad . 
you be the well i 'd ever have . 
if i have n't blow the whole thing year ago i may not be alone . 
tomorrow we can drive around this town , and let the cop chase we around . 
the past be go , but something may be find to take it place . 
hey jealousy .

tomorrow we can drive around this town , and let the cop chase we around . 
the past be go , but something may be find to take it place .
