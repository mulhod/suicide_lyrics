#norwich jail so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail . 
the food be foul . 
the air be bad . 
the company not choice . 
it will make you scowl to hear this mad old turnkey 's rasp voice . 
it will make you wonder will you ever live to tell the tale of the hardship and the misery you 've know in norwich jail . 
we water here be scummy-green . 
we bed be heap of straw . 
there 's water run down the wall , rat run over the floor . 
there 's naught to eat but rotten meat this 'd make a dog turn pale . 
oh , it 's dainty board and lodge when you visit norwich jail ! 
so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail . 
whene 'er we fancy bath , we paddle in the drain . 
and when we want a concert , we rattle of we chain . 
and when we want a banquet we drink sludge and call it ale . 
if you want a good time , commit a crime and come to norwich jail ! 
now if you fancy game here , the race be run by flea . 
the stake be perilously high : a crust of moldy cheese . 
the first time this i try me luck , i nearly lose me shirt . 
but lucky for me they can n't see the bugger for the dirt . 
so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail . 
if they 'd send we to america , today we will be free . 
but since the revolution this land we 'll never see . 
we be not for new england 's shore , three thousand mile away . 
they say we 're bind for some further grind and they 've name it botany bay . 
well perhaps it 's out by india , or maybe near japan . 
just off the coast of canada or in the hill of spain . 
but wherever this strange land may be we know it can fail to be a far , far well place than stink norwich jail . 
so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale we long for the day when we 'll sail away from stink norwich jail .
