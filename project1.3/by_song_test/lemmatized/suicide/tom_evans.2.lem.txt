#beautiful and blue he look out of he window at the people pass by . 
they look so happy . 
make he cry . 
he watch they laugh . 
see the lover hold hand , and everyone each other 's friend . 
beautiful and blue , they 're not as good as you . 
beautiful and blue , they 're lonely too . 
he feel so unhappy . 
he no long care for life and be close to end all he strife . 
the world do n't know he . 
it 's so hard and cold and cruel . 
he wonder why he 's such a fool . 
beautiful and blue . 
beautiful and blue .
