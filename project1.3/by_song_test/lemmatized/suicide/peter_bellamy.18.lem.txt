# the ballad of henry and susannah , pt . 
5th it be in the month of january australia 's coast draw near , and in this fair clime the sun do shine which fill they heart with cheer . 
and soon in peaceful sydney cove at anchor they do ride and admire the green and pleasant shear beyond the foam tide . 
then up speak captain philip , for so richly dress be he : " some man must bear me through the surf and keep me from the sea ! 
" then up step henry cabell , be one both stout and tall , say , " captain , i will be this man and will not let you fall . 
" and so they sit they in the jolly boat , and the crow do pull for land . 
and when they reach the shallow , henry o 'er the gunwale spring . 
he take the captain up on he back and he wade to the sand . 
the very first of exile in this distant part to stand . 
and a fortnight late henry take susannah for he wife , the comfort of he dark day to comfort he through life . 
and when they year of sentence pass , they happiness do grow with property , prosperity and child also . 
and so come all you gentle people who be lose in dark dismay , and remember this the black night must some time yield to day . 
remember this the wild storm eventually must pass and , like henry and susannah , may you find you joy at last .
