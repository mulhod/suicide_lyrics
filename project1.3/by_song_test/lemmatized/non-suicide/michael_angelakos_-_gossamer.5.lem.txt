#mirrored sea well , he call the whole thing such a wild mistake . 
he say he do n't mean no harm . 
well , it be a big to-do , but nothing else be new . 
he past checker like checkerboard in central park . 
you do good in the light and the bad in the dark . 
good man be scarce and few . 
they 're always pass through . 
oh , you mirror sea . 
you wave , they 're haunt me . 
they 're all i see . 
oh , let me be , you mirror sea . 
you wave , they 're haunt me . 
oh mirror sea , leave me be . 
bear with a chance this everybody take , with all risk and hardly any reward . 
bounce off the wall of you teens like in a pinball machine . 
slip-up in this town be like a sentence to life like overhear insult or a cheat wife and then it 's down for the count , the lose this wo n't be find . 
oh , you mirror sea . 
you wave , they 're haunt me . 
they 're all i see . 
oh , let me be , you mirror sea . 
you wave , they 're haunt me . 
oh mirror sea , leave me be . 
everyone 's alone . 
oh , you mirror sea . 
you wave , they 're haunt me . 
they 're all i see . 
oh , let me be , you mirror sea . 
you wave , they 're haunt me . 
oh , mirror sea , leave me be .
