#landed we 'd hit the bottom . 
i think it be me fault and in a way i guess it be . 
i 'm just now find out what it be all about . 
we 'd move to the west coast , away from everyone . 
he never tell me this you call back when i be still , i be still in love till i open me eye and walk out the door and the cloud come tumble down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i try . 
and i twist it wrong just to make it right , have to leave me behind . 
and i 've be fly high all night , so come pick me up . 
i 've land . 
the daily drama he make from nothing , so nothing ever make it right . 
he like to push me and talk me back down till i believe i be the crazy one , and in a way i guess i be . 
well i open me eye and walk out the door and the cloud come tumble down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i try . 
drag the sea of a trouble mind , have to leave me behind . 
sing bye-bye , goodbye , i try . 
if you write me off , i 'd understand it because i 've be on some other planet , so come pick me up . 
i 've land . 
and you will be so happy to know i 've come alone . 
it 's over . 
well i open me eye and walk out the door and the cloud come tumble down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i try . 
down come the reign of the telephone czar . 
it 's okay to call and i will answer for me . 
come pick me up . 
come pick me up . 
i 've land .
