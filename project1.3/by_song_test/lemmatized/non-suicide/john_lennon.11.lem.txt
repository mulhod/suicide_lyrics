#crippled inside you can shine you shoe and wear a suit . 
you can comb you hair and look quite cute . 
you can hide you face behind a smile . 
one thing you ca n't hide be when you 're cripple inside . 
you can wear a mask and paint you face . 
you can call you the human race . 
you can wear a collar and a tie . 
one thing you ca n't hide be when you 're cripple inside . 
well , now , you know this you cat have nine life , nine life to it , but you only get one and a dog 's life ai n't fun . 
mama , take a look outside . 
you can go to church and sing a hymn . 
you can judge me by the color of me skin . 
you can live a lie until you die . 
one thing you ca n't hide be when you 're cripple inside .
