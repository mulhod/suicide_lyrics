#mind game we 're play this mind game together , push the barrier , plant seed , play the mind guerrilla , chant the mantra peace on earth . 
we all be play this mind game forever , some kind of druid dude lift the veil , do the mind guerrilla .

love be a flower . 
you get to let it grow . 
so keep on play this mind game together , faith in the future out of the now .

yes be the answer and you know this for sure . 
yes be surrender . 
you get to let it go . 
so keep on play this mind game together , do the ritual dance in the sun , million of mind guerrilla put they soul power to the karmic wheel . 
keep on play this mind game together , raise the spirit of peace and love . 
i want you to make love , not war . 
i know you 've hear it before .
