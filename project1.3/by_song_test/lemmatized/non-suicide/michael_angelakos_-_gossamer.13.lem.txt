#almost there there be thing you 'll never learn , like there 's nothing to hide from . 
house of people at you door . 
give it away , they 'll just take more . 
but i do n't know what you want , but i ca n't get it out of me brain . 
yeah , you 're almost there . 
there be thing you 'll never do , like even try to hurt me too . 
god know something more than ruin . 
put you down and blame me mood . 
all this talk - i swear , i ca n't get it out of me brain . 
yeah , you 're almost there . 
yeah , you 're almost there .
