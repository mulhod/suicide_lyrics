#jesusland take a walk . 
out the gate you go and never stop , past dollar store and wig shop , quarter in a cup for every block . 
and watch the building grow small as you go down the track , beautiful mcmansions on a hill this . 
overlook a highway with riverboat casino and you still have yet to see a soul . 
jesusland , jesusland . 
town to town , broadcast to each house , they drop you name , but no one know you face . 
billboard quote thing you 'd never say . 
you hang you head and pray for jesusland , jesusland . 
mile and mile , and the sun go down . 
pulse glow from they home . 
you 're not alone . 
light come on as you lie you weary head on they lawn . 
park lot , crack and grow grass . 
you see it all from office to farm . 
cross fly high above the mall . 
a long walk through jesusland , jesusland .
