#i do n't know whatever it be you 're think , sit down and let 's give it a try . 
you know this i 'll always listen , but sometime i 'm wonder why . 
you do n't lie to me , and i will n't lie to you , oh , no . 
baby i 'm feel lose . 
i do n't know what i 'm go to do . 
you do n't know what you 're put me through . 
i get to get away from you . 
once in a while you 're lonely .

i 'm wonder what be the matter , but you say this you ca n't explain . 
but you do n't lie to me , and i will n't lie to you , oh , no .

i get to get away from you . 
whatever it be you 're think , sit down and let 's give it a try . 
you know this i 'll always listen , but sometime i 'm wonder why .
