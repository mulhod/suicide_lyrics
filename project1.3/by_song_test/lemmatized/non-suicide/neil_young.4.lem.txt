#going back in a foreign land there be creature at play , run hand in hand , need nowhere to stay , drive to the mountain high , they be sunken in the city deep , live in me sleep. i feel like go back , back where there 's nowhere to stay , when fire fill the sky . 
i 'll still remember this day . 
this rock i 'm climb down have already leave the grind , careen through space . 
i use to build this building . 
i use to walk next to you . 
they shadow tear we apart and now we do what we do . 
drive to the mountain high , sunken in the city deep , live in we sleep. i feel like go back , back where there 's nowhere to stay .
