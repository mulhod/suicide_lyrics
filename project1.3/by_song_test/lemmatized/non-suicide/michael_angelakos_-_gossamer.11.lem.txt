#it 's not me fault , i 'm happy sorry i can n't be there , i be tie to a rock chair . 
i be beat down to a pulp , rock back and forth somewhere . 
if you know , if you see , you 'd have say it be the final straw , this me life be bind and tether on a porch by the shear . 
but there be no easy way to tell they so , the thing you know . 
and run , they say . 
they think they know exactly so . 
it 's not right , it 's not right . 
how be i the only one who see we fight ? 
what be we ? 
who be they ? 
who say this bastard do n't deserve to pay ? 
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance . 
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance . 
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair . 
still i 'm the only one who seem to care . 
it 's funny this be funny make you feel like up and run when you past linger like rain cloud , cast shadow below . 
i can live with so many burden . 
i take all you hope and yearn , but there 's no one i want to take me for this petty little rise . 
i use to glow . 
once i have a love to show , a love they know . 
they 're slow , so slow this they never know where i go . 
it 's not right , it 's not right . 
how be i the only one who see we fight ? 
what be we ? 
who be they ? 
who say this bastard do n't deserve to pay ? 
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance . 
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance . 
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair . 
still i 'm the only one who seem to care . 
i know this it 's only something . 
i 'm just work with what i 've be give . 
it 's not me fault , i 'm happy . 
do n't call me crazy , i 'm happy . 
it 's not right , it 's not right . 
how be i the only one who see we fight ? 
what be we ? 
who be they ? 
who say this bastard do n't deserve to pay ? 
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .

it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair . 
still i 'm the only one who seem to care .
