#somewhere they ca n't find me i can hear the soft breathe of the girl this i love as he lie here beside me , asleep with the night . 
he hair in a fine mist float on me pillow , reflect the glow of the winter moonlight . 
but i 've get to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway . 
before they come to catch me , i 'll be go somewhere they ca n't find me . 
oh baby , you do n't know what i 've do . 
i 've commit a crime , i 've break the law . 
while you be here sleep and just dream of me , i hold up and rob a liquor store . 
but i 've get to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway . 
before they come to catch me , i 'll be go somewhere they ca n't find me . 
oh me life seem unreal , me crime an illusion , a scene badly write in which i must play . 
and though it put me uptight to leave you , i know it 's not right to leave you when morning be just a few hour away . 
but i 've get to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway . 
before they come to catch me , i 'll be go somewhere they ca n't find me .
