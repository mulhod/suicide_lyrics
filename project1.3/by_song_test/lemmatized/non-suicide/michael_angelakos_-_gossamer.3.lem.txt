#carried away since me heart be golden , i 've get sense to hold in . 
tempt just to make an ugly scene . 
no , i 'm not as proper . 
me money 's in copper . 
rip down from the brownstone to the street . 
listen , i 'm you friend , do n't quote me , but not a friend worth note . 
yes , please do n't ever note me as you friend . 
who say we have cold heart act out we old part ? 
dance before me favorite little scene , oh , oh , oh , oh . 
i get carry away , carry away from you , and i 'm hope and i 'm pray because i 'm sorry , sorry about this , sorry about thing this i 've say . 
always let it get to me head . 
all you appeal , once again we 'd feel high education make sense . 
justify you thesis , certain this you need this . 
tell me what you point be in defense . 
listen , i do n't really know you , and i do n't think i want to , but i think i can fake it if you can . 
let 's agree there 's no need , no more talk of money . 
let 's just keep pretend to be friend , oh , oh , oh . 
i get carry away , carry away from you , and i 'm hope and i 'm pray because i 'm sorry , sorry about this , sorry about thing this i 've say . 
always let it get to me head . 
i get carry away , carry away from you , and i 'm hope and i 'm pray because i 'm sorry , sorry about this , sorry about thing this i 've say . 
always let it get to me head . 
wake up in the morning . 
wake up in the even . 
wake up when you want to because no one 's really watch . 
wish you have something to say about it , but we all have problem . 
we 're all have problem and we all get something to say . 
i get carry away , carry away from you , and i 'm hope and i 'm pray because i 'm sorry , sorry about this , sorry about thing this i 've say . 
always let it get to me head . 
i get carry away , carry away from you , and i 'm hope and i 'm pray because i 'm sorry , sorry about this , sorry about thing this i 've say . 
always let it get to me head .
