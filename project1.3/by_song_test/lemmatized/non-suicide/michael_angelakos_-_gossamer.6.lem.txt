#cry like a ghost all on me own , where i find you alone , you be catch up in somebody else 's mess and , yes , i drink all this drink on me own . 
me life 's become some blurry little quest . 
and the clock keep tick slowly , and you lean over to ask me if i even have a clue where i be . 
well , i lied down you wood floor , and me brain and body take course in the night and then , as though it never be . 
it all begin to feel the same . 
i want to know where they keep the rain . 
sylvia , right back where you come from . 
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb , but , sylvia , no one 's go to tell you when enough 's enough . 
enough be enough . 
sick to the bone on the step to me home . 
the moon shine through the drapery of leave to he , to ignore everyone on me own , me true love , just to feel some make up breeze . 
but , as me body crumble , you walk as i just stumble , and we speak only of thing make in me head . 
you never once control me , what all the others tell me this , if i keep on go , i 'd be dead . 
it 's not just you who feel the pain . 
now , tell me where they keep the rain . 
sylvia , right back where you come from . 
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb , but , sylvia , no one 's go to tell you when enough 's enough . 
enough be enough . 
see what i 've do now . 
i do n't understand he say i scream and this i raise me hand , but i never mean to . 
be n't even there . 
i never mean to . 
i will never dare . 
sylvia , right back where you come from . 
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb , but , sylvia , no one 's go to tell you when enough 's enough . 
enough 's always too tough . 
sylvia , right back where you come from . 
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb . 
but , sylvia , no one 's go to tell you when enough 's enough . 
enough be enough .
