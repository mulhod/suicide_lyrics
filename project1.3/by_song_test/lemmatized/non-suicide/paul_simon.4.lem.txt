#kathy 's song i hear the drizzle of the rain . 
like a memory it fall , soft and warm continuing , tap on me roof and wall . 
and from the shelter of me mind through the window of me eye , i gaze beyond the rain-drenched street to england where me heart lie . 
me mind 's distract and diffuse . 
me thought be many mile away . 
they lie with you when you 're asleep and kiss you when you start you day . 
and as a song i be write be leave undo , i do n't know why i spend me time write song i ca n't believe with word this tear and strain to rhyme . 
and so you see i have come to doubt all this i once hold as true . 
i stand alone without belief . 
the only truth i know be you . 
and as i watch the drop of rain weave they weary path and die . 
i know this i be like the rain . 
there but for the grace of you go i .
