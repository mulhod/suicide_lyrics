# though i know he lie when i look though you eye , i tend to get bitter . 
maybe i 'm well advise to look to me . 
i fall every time , though i know he lie . 
i ca n't stay away . 
star will fall from the sky , and i wo n't forsake you . 
you 've get lust in you heart . 
what 's sad to me ? 
i 'll use every line , anything to make you me . 
keep me in the dark . 
wonder where you be . 
do n't let me fall apart . 
you say take it slow , but i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
lie awake in the be try to cope with the feeling . 
i do n't know if it 's love , but what can i do ? 
i fall every time , though i know he lie . 
i ca n't stay away .
