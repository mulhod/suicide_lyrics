#little secret when i come down , the dawn pour into me . 
i shake they up , the wall come crumble , me thin skin tremble with this salty wound , me steal gold inside the emperor 's tomb . 
now paint rainbow on me ugly face . 
i build this cardboard neighborhood 's disgrace . 
but i ascend and serve me feverish need within the confine of such chemistry . 
it 's the way i see everything i need . 
it 's no way to be . 
let this be we little secret . 
no one need to know we 're feel high and high and high , high and high and high . 
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me . 
up and up we keep on climb , high and high and high , high and high and high . 
me face blow up at such a casual sight , the smatter color of ecstatic fright , the rush above me to oblivion , outline wet sidewalk in halogen . 
oh , have you ever feel so goddam strong ? 
how come it take some people so damn long ? 
he turn to squeeze the lemon juice to rain . 
the citrus draw out the scene in stain . 
watch the basin drain as you life line wane and you ca n't explain as you friend complain . 
you 've cause all this pain and you proudly shame you whole family 's name . 
let this be we little secret . 
no one need to know we 're feel high and high and high , high and high and high . 
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me . 
up and up we keep on climb , high and high and high , high and high and high . 
mother , i can tell what you 've be think , stare at the star on you ceiling , think once there be a power this you be wield . 
but now i 've hit the mark , stab at the dark , and i can help but ignore the people stare at me scar . 
let this be we little secret . 
no one need to know we 're feel high and high and high , high and high and high . 
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me . 
up and up we keep on climb , high and high and high , high and high and high .
