#look out for me love there 's a lot to learn for waste time . 
there 's a heart this burn . 
there 's an open mind . 
look out for me love , look out for me love , look out for me love , look out for me love . 
you own it , you own it now . 
you own it . 
there 's a weight on you , but you ca n't feel it . 
live like i do , it 's hard for you to see it . 
be i hurt too bad ? 
can i show you daylight ? 
how can i be sad when i know this you may ? 
look out for me love , look out for me love , look out for me love , look out for me love . 
look out for me love . 
it 's in you neighborhood . 
i know thing be go to change , but i ca n't say bad or good . 
silver wing of morning shine in the gray day while the ice be form on a lonely runway . 
hydraulic wiper pump till the window glisten . 
something say something . 
no one seem to listen . 
man with walkie-talkie , man with flashlight wave . 
up upon the tower time read daylight saving . 
i 'm home again to you , babe . 
you know it make me wonder , sit in the quiet slipstream in the thunder . 
look out for me love , look out for me love , look out for me love , look out for me love .
