#hideaway who can love you in the way this you love you ? 
you 're alone , darling , and there 's nothing to argue . 
if you life evolve into ruin , everyone 's watch all this you 're do . 
say you head 's turn . 
maybe you should start run . 
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you can stay . 
come and play , oh , me hideaway . 
someday everything will be okay . 
you 're not strong so you , you can hurt he so badly . 
you do n't mean to , hurt he be too madden . 
when you do , it 's a war in you head . 
what you mean to say be n't always worth say . 
take a deep breath as soon as you let go . 
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you can stay . 
come and play , oh , me hideaway . 
someday everything will be okay . 
what 's the point to this , feel happiness in life ? 
as we fight off we demise , or love as we play into it lie , oh honey . 
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you can stay . 
come and play , oh , me hideaway . 
someday everything will be okay .
