#i be a rock a winter 's day in a deep and dark december , i be alone , gaze from me window to the street below on a freshly fall silent shroud of snow . 
i be a rock . 
i be an island . 
i 've build wall , a fortress deep and mighty , this none may penetrate . 
i have no need of friendship ; friendship cause pain . 
it 's laughter and it 's love i disdain . 
i be a rock . 
i be an island . 
do n't talk of love , but i 've hear the word before . 
it 's sleep in me memory . 
i wo n't disturb the slumber of feeling this have die . 
if i never love i never will have cry . 
i be a rock . 
i be an island . 
i have me book and me poetry to protect me . 
i be shield in me armor , hide in me room , safe within me womb . 
i touch no one and no one touch me . 
i be a rock , i be an island . 
and a rock feel no pain . 
and an island never cry .
