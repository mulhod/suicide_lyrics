Apple of My Eye

Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away though inside my heart, I really want to stay.
Believe the love we have is so sincere.
You know, the gift you have will always be.
You're the apple of my eye.
You're the apple of my heart, but now the time has come to part.
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to make a stand though we never meant to bite the loving hand.
And now the time has come to walk alone.
We were the children.
now we've overgrown.
You're the apple of my eye.
You're the apple of my heart, but now the time has come to part.
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away though inside my heart, I really want to stay.
Believe the love we have is so sincere.
You know, the gift you have will always be.
You're the apple of my eye.
You're the apple of my heart, but now the time has come to part.
Now the time has come to part.
Now the time has come to part.

#Timeless

We are yesterday.
we are today.
We are tomorrow.
we are timeless.
We are then.
we are now.
We are the future.
we are timeless.
We are the sorrow.
we are the pain.
We are the sunshine.
we are rain.
We are love.
we are hate.
We are the future.
we are timeless.
Whatever we see, wherever we go shows perfectly clear how little we know.
How can we look and not even see?
How can we live and not even be free?
We are the comfort.
we are the shame.
We are forgiveness.
we are blame.
We are kind.
we are kill.
Are we the future?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we?

#I Miss You

Though you've been gone for just a week, it makes me feel so sad to speak.
Lady, come back.
I miss you.
And, though before I didn't cry, now my eyes are never dry and a thousand jesters couldn't make me smile.
I miss you.
I miss you.
And now I know that I was wrong, but it's too late for now you've gone.
Lady, come back.
I miss you.
And, though our times were good and bad, now you're gone, I'm always sad and a thousand jesters couldn't make me smile.
I miss you.
I miss you.
I miss you.

#Shine On

Shine on, shine on me.
All I know is now I want you close to me.
I can't really tell you what the future's going to be.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
Lean on, lean on me.
Something tells me that's the way it's gotta be.
I can't really show you what the future's going to be.
Just for now, little lady, lean on me.
To fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane.
Don't think of tomorrow.
yesterday is past.
And, if you could, you know we could make it last.
Drink on, drink on me.
Slip and slide, so I'll forget reality.
I can't really say if I'll come on and get so free.
Just for now, little lady, drink on me.
To fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane.
Don't think of tomorrow.
yesterday is past.
And, if you could, you know we could make it last.
Shine on, shine on me.
All I know is now I want you close to me.
I can't really tell you what the future's going to be.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.

#Song for a Lost Friend

You had a dream.
You know you dreamt so much.
You had a dream.
You know it meant so much.
You're just a victim of the circumstance.
I mean, what else could you do?
You saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true.
What could you do?
You had a goal.
You know you aimed so high.
You had soul.
You knew you had to try.
You're just a victim of the time of day.
No matter what you say or do, you saw your dream and you just took a play and for a while your dream came true.
What could you do?
What could you do?
You're just a victim of the circumstance.
I mean, what else could you do?
You saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true.
What could you do?
What could you do?
What could you do?
What could you do?

#Matted Spam

I feel a change coming on.
a frame of mind that's held me down for too long, tried to imprison my soul, locked me outside of my own Rock-n-Roll.
Can you feel it?
Oh, yeah.
Can you feel the change?
It's coming.
Feel it, oh, yeah.
Feel the change.
it's coming my way, yeah.
I see a light from a night, a distant star, but it's shining so bright, guiding me out of myself.
This newfound love has got me under its spell.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah.
Can you see the light?
It's coming.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah.
Can you see the light?
It's coming today.
For years and years I've waited so long.
I almost lost control.
The days and nights all seemed to be wrong without you, little Miss Rock-N-Roll.
You know I tell you no lie.
My little lady, lift me up to the sky.
She put the stomp on my blues.
She blow the dust off my old blue suede shoes.
Feel it, oh, yeah.
Can you feel the change?
It's coming.
Can you feel it?
Yeah.
Can you feel the change?
It's coming my way, yeah.
I feel a change coming on.
a frame of mind that's held me down for too long, tried to imprison my soul, locked me outside of my own Rock-n-Roll.

Yeah.

Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can't feel it.
Can you feel the light?
Can you see the light?

Can you see the light?

#Lonely You

When I look into your tearful eyes, I don't know what to do.
And, though you say that I don't realize, I sympathize with you.
lonely you, only you.
Yes, I do.
Lonely you, only you.
Lonely you.
When I ask you just to be my friend, I want to lend a hand, but, if we get too close, it's sure to end.
Oh, can't you understand?
Lonely you, only you.
Yes, it will.
Lonely you, only you.
Lonely you.
We really need a friend and friends are hard to find and harder still to keep.
Lonely you.
Lonely me.
Lonely you, only you.
Yes, it will.
Lonely you, only you.
Lonely you.
Lonely you.
Lonely you.

#Crimson Ship

My life was colored, painting pictures out of tune.
You came from nowhere in a song.
It might have been the way I laughed.
he made the jokes could only show me what was wrong.
He took me flying on his crimson ship.
He never left me his number.
He took me flying on his crimson ship.
Then he was gone and I wondered.
Who put the knots on all the crosses on the hill?
Why did the old man wash his hands?
Who grew the flower that was big enough to kill and blew the trumpet in the van?
He took me flying on his crimson ship.
He never left me his number.
He took me flying on his crimson ship.
Then he was gone and I wondered.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
When they were busy throwing kisses at the moon, a father lost his mother's son and, though they knew the resurrection would be soon, the time was spent.
they carried on, on.
He took me flying on his crimson ship.
He never left me his number.
He took me flying on his crimson ship
Then he was gone and I wondered, wondered, wondered, wondered.

#Midnight Sun

Oh, no, oh, no, I think it's time for me to run.
Well, I've been working all the summer, waiting for the winter to come and, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I think I've been away too long.
Well, I've been coming and I'm going.
All the time is growing with fun and, if you feel like something's missing, well, come into the midnight sun.
Never be a gooseberry for gooseberries should never see it.
Drop the one who's looking at you looking at the one who's seeing you be it.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I think I've been away too long.
Well, I've been waiting all the summer, counting all the trophies I've won and, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
Oh no, oh no, I think it's time for me to run.
Well, I've been working all the summer, waiting for the winter to come and, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
And, if you feel like something's missing, well, come into the midnight sun.
And, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.

#Rock of All Ages

my, my.
You always want it right now and you know it brings me down, but I don't.
why, why?

#Carry on Till Tomorrow

In younger days, I told myself my life would be my own and I'd leave the place where sunshine never shone for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the rising sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on till tomorow.
there's no reason to look back.
Carry on, carry on, carry on beyond the shadows of the clouds and onward to the sky.
Carry on till I find the rainbow's end for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the rising sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on till tomorow.
there's no reason to look back.
Carry on, carry on, carry on.
Drifting on the wings of freedom, leave this stormy day and we'll ride to tomorrow's golden fields for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the rising sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on.
And, when the heavy journey's done, I'll rest my weary head for the world and its colours will be mine for my life's too short for waiting.
when I see the setting sun, then I know again that I must carry on, carry on till tomorow.
there's no reason to look back.
Carry on, carry on, carry on.

#I'm in Love

I'm not well.
can't you tell?
I've never felt like this before.
Very strange, got no pain, but I can't wait to get some more.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
Hold me tight every night.
Never go away from me.
Say you will love me still.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
Where have you been all my life?
I'd like to make us man and wife
What about a house just for us?
See the children on the bus.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.

#Walk Out in the Rain

So I just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me.
And, if the rain should go away, then in my lonely room I'll stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away.
So I just live a life of hope, pretending that I couldn't care, but, if you find you cannot cope, just call my name and I'll be there.
If I could live my life again, I still relive those precious times.
Although I know there would be pain, it felt so good while you were mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
So I Just walk out in the rain, so I Just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain, so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me, thousand tears you gave.
And, if the rain should go away, and if the rain should go away, then in my lonely room I stay, then in my lonely room I stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go.
And, if you ever change your mind, you know, baby, you will find all my sorrow and my pain.
You'll find me walking in the rain.

#Knocking Down Our Home

Your heart is in your home, they say.
Your home's where you belong.
but someone stole my heart today, so listen to my song.

Ten thousand meals she's cooked, But now her eyes are filled with tears.
It isn't fair.
nobody cares.
They're knocking down our home, Ruining all we own.

#See-Saw Granpa

You want to have fun.
you want to just run.
You want to do a lot of things that older people never do.
Gotta give up.
is that what they say?
Well, don't believe a word and then do it my way.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa, and watch them grow older when you were still young.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa.
You gotta be bolder.
let's always be sound.
You want to just move.

#I Can't Take It

Just give me five so I can step outside
Or even give me three and I'll be satisfied
But if you give me none at all
You're going to see me climb that wall
And you know you're going to see me fall
And I can't take it

Take all the nights that a man can give and make all the days so a man can live, but, if you take up every hour, you're going to take up all my power and you know you're going to turn me sour and I can't take it, no.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
Give me all your money in your dark brown vase.
You've even got my soul in your dark brown case, but, baby, can't you see outside?
You know you've got my fingers tied and you know you're going to hurt my pride and I can't take it.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
Give me all your money in your dark brown vase.
You've even got my soul in your dark brown case, but, baby, can't you see outside when you know you've got my fingers tied and you know you're going to hurt my pride and I can't take it?
I can't take it, oh, no.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
I can't take it, oh, no.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.

#Midnight Caller

Beneath the midnight caller she thinks of paper green.
You never hear them calling her name.
They just know where they've been.
You never hear her holler.
The tears no longer come.
She reads her daily book of the past that shows of everyone.
Grey years that show in her hair.
Can't be, but don't seem to care.
She unlocks the door and there's no one there.
She sees a daytime stroller walk from the night before and, though she paints a smile on her face, he won't be back no more.
She's got no saint to follow.
She's got no place to go.
Too proud to ask an old friend for help.
Too proud to let him know.
Grey years that show in her hair.
Can't be, but don't seem to care.
She knocks the door and there's no one there.
nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody's going to help you now.

#No Matter What

No matter what you are I will always be with you.
Doesn't matter what you do, girl.
Oh, girl, with you.
No matter what you do I will always be around.
Won't you tell me what you found, girl?
Oh, girl, won't you?
Knock down the old gray wall and be a part of it all.
Nothing to say.
nothing to see.
nothing to do.
If you would give me all as I would give it to you, nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be.
No matter where you go there will always be a place.
Can't you see it in my face, girl?
Oh, girl, want you.
Knock down the old gray wall.
Be a part of it all.
Nothing to say.
nothing to see.
nothing to do.
If you would give me all as I would give it to you, nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be.
No matter what you are I will always be with you.
Doesn't matter what you do, girl.
Oh, girl, with you.
Oh, girl, you girl.
Want you.
Oh, girl, you girl.
Want you.

#Without You

Well, I can't forget this evening and your face when you were leaving, but I guess that's just the way the story goes.
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows.
Yes, it shows.
Well, I can't forget tomorrow when I think of all my sorrow.
I had you there, but then I let you go and now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
Well, I can't forget this evening and your face when you were leaving, but I guess that's just the way the story goes.
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows.

I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.
I can't live.
I can't give anymore.
I can't live if living is without you.

#Blodwyn

I put away the knife, the chisel, and the saw.
I've locked away my life behind this old oak door to make a simple spoon, a token of my love in hope that maybe soon it's me you're thinking of.
So take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn.
The valley knows the way I feel today.
So take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn, before some other spoon takes you away.
My life may not be long, was working down below for so much can go wrong, but what else do I know?
So take these precious years and make them precious too and say you'll take from me what I will give to you.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn.
The valley knows the way I feel today.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn, before some other spoon takes you away.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn.
Valley knows the way I feel today.
Take my spoon, Blodwyn.
Make it soon, Blodwyn, before some other spoon takes you away.

#Watford John

You show me all your loving.
Then you turn and tell me no!
Open up your arms and let it go.
You give me all your kissing.
Then you freeze and stop the flow.
Open up your knees and let it go.
I don't want a Cinderella.
I just want my teddy bear.
I don't want a backstage Bella.
I just want to take you there.
Baby, won't you think it over?
Try and see my point of view.
Let it go.
You show me all your loving.
Then you turn and tell me no!
Open up your arms and let it go, let it go, let it go.
I don't want a Cinderella.
I just want my teddy bear.
I don't want a backstage Bella.
I just want to take you there.
Baby, won't you think it over?
Try and see my point of view.
Come on, baby, won't you tell me no!
Bop bop-a-lop do-wop.
Let it go, let it go, let it go.
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.
Let it go, let it go.
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.

#We're for the Dark

Tell me the day and I'll set you free, what you want to be.
Show me the way and I'll let you see what you do to me.
Well, it's not enough to live.
If you're going to take, then you have to give.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I.
Show me the clouds and I'll give you sky if you want me to.
Show me the crowds and I'll make you sigh if you take me through.
Well, it's not enough to be.
If you're going to look, then you have to see.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I.
Show me the way and I'll set you free, what you ought to be.
Tell me the day and I'll let you see what you do to me.
Well, it's not enough to live.
If you're going to take, then you have to give.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I.
Show me the clouds and I'll give you sky if you want me to.
Show me the crowds and I'll make you cry if you take me through.
Well, it's not enough to be.
If you gotta look, then you have to see.
We're for the dark, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I, baby, you and I.

#Get Down

Get down, baby, get down.
Get down to my heart.
Be around, baby, be around.
Be around when I call.
You say your name is Mary, but I got my point of view.
Got the time to show you that it's true.
Yes, I do.
Thrill me, baby.
Come on.
Way down to my feet.
Get down, baby, get down.
Get down to my heart.
You say your name is Mary, but I got my point of view.
I got the time to show you that it's true.
Yes, I do.
Get down.

#I'll Be the One

Where did you go when you were needed?
Was it some place I know, where they care?
Cries in the rain.
I'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart.
I'll be the one.
we'll be together.
I'll be the one forever and ever.
Look at me now.
am I the loser?
If you can't tell me how, tell me why.
But just the same, I'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart.
I'll be the one.
we'll be together.
I'll be the one forever and ever and ever.
I'll be the one.
we'll be together.
I'll be the one forever and ever and ever.

#Take It All

In a way, the sun has shone on me.
Makes it easy to make it hard.
Take an inch, take a yard, take it all.
I don't need it at all.
Any day the sun could shine on you.
Makes it silly to make it bad.
Take it good, take it glad, take it all.
Don't you know there's a stronger thing keeping us together?
Don't you know there's a song to sing?
Sing on.
let the feeling take you high.
Don't you know there's a stronger thing keeping us together?
Don't you know there's a song to sing?
Sing on.
let the feeling take you high.
Any day, the sun will shine on you.
Makes it silly to take it bad.
Make it good, take it glad, take it all.
I don't need it at all.
I don't want it at all.
No, no, no.

#Name of the Game

Saw the railway master and I looked him in the eye.
Said, "Would you go much faster if you thought that you would die?"
He said, "Not me, sir.
I could not care.
In fact, I would not try.
Protest would not take me far.
It's different, me not being a star."
I lock my feelings in a jar until another day.
Comfort me, dear brother.
Won't you tell me what you know?
Somewhere in this painful world is a place where I can go.
Oh, long-awaiting mother, is it time to make a show and take your babies to your breast?
No, we never passed the test and all our sins should be confessed before we carry on.
Oh, don't refuse me.
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame.
No, don't confuse me for I know it's the name of the game.
Got up off my pillow and I looked up at the sun.
Said, "You can see quite clearly now the things that we have done."
We burned your sacred willow and our battles we have won, but did we get so very far?
It's different, me not being a star.
Lock my feelings in a jar until we go away.
Oh, don't refuse me.
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame.
No, don't confuse me for I know it's the name of the game.
Oh, don't refuse me.
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame.
No, don't confuse me for I know that's the name of the game.
Don't refuse me.
Don't confuse me.
Oh, oh, oh.
Don't refuse me.
Don't confuse me.
Oh, oh, oh.

#Day After Day

I remember finding out about you.
Every day my mind is all around you.
looking out from my lonely room day after day.
Bring it home, baby.
make it soon.
I give my love to you.
I remember holding you while you sleep.
Every day I feel the tears that you weep.
looking out of my lonely gloom day after day.
Bring it home, baby.
make it soon.
I give my love to you.
Looking out of my lonely room day after day.
Bring it home, baby.
make it soon.
I give my love to you.
I remember finding out about you.
Every day my mind is all around you.
Looking out of my lonely gloom day after day.
Bring it home, baby.
make it soon.
I give my love to you.

#Perfection

There is no real perfection.
There'll be no perfect day.
Just love is our connection, the truth in what we say.
There's no good revolution, just power changing hands.
There is no straight solution, except to understand.
So listen to my song of life.
You don't need a gun or a knife.
Successful conversation will take you very far.
There is no real perfection.
There'll be no perfect man.
Just peace is our connection, forgiving all you can.
There's no good kind of killing, just power taking life.
It's all good blood that's spilling to make a bigger knife.
So listen to my song of life.
You don't need a gun or a knife.
Successful conversation will take you very far.
Successful conversations will take you very far.
So listen to my song of life.
You don't need a gun or a knife.
Successful conversation will take you very far.
Successful conversations will take you very far.
Successful conversations will take you very far.

#Just a Chance

Doesn't matter what you think I do.
All I want to do is see it through.
You may say it's not a great romance, but all I want from you is just a chance to try, any way at all.
Don't you think we know it has to hurt?
Are minds that small?
I won't tell you if it's short or long.
All I know is that it don't feel wrong.
You may say it's not a great romance, but all we want from you is just a chance to try any way we can.
Don't you think we know it has to hurt?
Won't you understand?
Doesn't matter what you think I do.

#Know One Knows

No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when I see you glow.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it show.
Keep it coming.
keep it long.
Caress me with your body song.
Reach it higher with each sigh, knowing soon that we will fly.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when I see you glow.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it flow.
Keep it moving.
keep it bright and guide me with your body light.
Come in closer with each sigh, knowing soon that we will fly.
No one knows.
No one knows.
No one knows.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it show.
No one knows.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it flow.
Keep on feeling.
keep it whole and lead me with your body soul.
Take me higher with each sigh, knowing you can make me fly.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when I see you glow.

#Dennis

Deeper waters flowed.
Recently it showed.
Trying to cover your head.
Trying to frighten you.
Trying to fight with you.
Really getting you scared.
But don't you worry, you love of mine.
Pretty soon it will all be fine and we'll just go on, higher hills to climb, climbing all the time, trying to find a way through, falling down again on the ground again, wondering what you can do.
But don't you worry, you love of ours.
They look like weeds, but they're really flowers and they'll soon be gone.
You won't stand up.
you won't sit down.
Your head's a mile above the ground.
And, though we tend to scold you now, I couldn't start to tell you how, we couldn't start to tell you how there's just no way to say how much we love you, you, little Dennis, you.
You're full of new surprise.
Love you.
You, little Dennis with the rascal in your eyes, you're a prize.
It could be bad.
it could be worse.
You're taking out your mother's purse.
And, though you cried when you got told the money there was for the old to keep their dogs from getting cold, the only thing that can't be sold is love.
You, little Dennis, you, you're full of new surprise.
Love you.
You, little Dennis with the rascal in your eyes.
Will you pick up your toys?
Will you be a good boy?
Will you please, please?
There's a way.
There's a way.
If you'll play, if you'll stay, there's a way through.
There's a way to take away blue, take away blue.
There's a way.
There's a way.
If you'll play, if you'll stay, there's a way through, there's a way to.

#Meanwhile Back at the Ranch

Why do you think me so hard to get?
Is there something they might regret?
Is it better to just forget, just forget?
If they only would let us know, then we'd know just how far to go, but instead they just tell us "no", tell us "no".
You, you always played the fool.
you always played the fool.
You always break the rule at every single school, you know.
you always break the rule.
It always pulled you down.
They could always pull you down.
You, you never stayed the same.
you never stayed the same and now you take the blame for all the little games they play.
you always take the blame and let it bring you down.
Why'd you let it bring you down?
Why do you think me so hard to get?
Is there something they might regret?
Is it better to just forget, just forget?
If they only would let us know, then we'd know just how far to go, but instead they just tell us "no", tell us "no".
You, you never stayed the same.
you never stayed the same and now you take the blame for all the little games they play.
you always take the blame and let it bring you down.
Why'd you let it bring you down?
