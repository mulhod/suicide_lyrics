Extraordinary Machine

I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes, and I certainly haven't been spreading myself around.
I still only travel by foot, and by foot it's a slow climb, but I'm good at being uncomfortable, so I can't stop changing all the time.
I notice that my opponent is always on the go, and won't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice he'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as they go fast from whence he came, but he's no good at being uncomfortable, so he can't stop staying exactly the same.
If there was a better way to go then it would find me.
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me.
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine.
I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day.
You deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay.
I mean to prove, I mean to move in my own way, and say I've been getting along for long before you came into the play.
I am the baby of the family, it happens, so everybody cares and wears the sheeps' clothes while they chaperone.  
Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease courteous, to try and help, but let me set your mind at ease.
If there was a better way to go then it would find me.
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me.
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine.
Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?
It's very kind, but it's to no avail; I don't want the bail.
I promise you, everything will be just fine.
If there was a better way to go then it would find me.
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me.
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine.

#Get Him Back

One man, he disappoint me.
He give me the gouge and he take my glee.
Now every other man I see remind me of the one man who disappoint me.
But wait till I get him back.
He won't have a back to scratch.
Yeah, keep turning that chin and you will see my face as I figure how to kill what I cannot catch.
So I say, and on I go to another one to disappoint me so.
Next one up, a contemptible snob.
He live to put things in their place.
He did a commendable job.
He put himself so low, he can hardly even look me in the face.
O, he made my blood just burn.
I flipped so far, I thought that I would not return.
But the last one I had who was getting my hopes up, I might've been a little fast to dismiss.
I think he let me down, when he didn't disappoint me.
He didn't always guess right, but he usually got my gist.
So wait till I get him back.
I'm going to bring him home, and I'll watch him unpack.
Yeah keep turning that chin, and you will see my face is fixed on the one I'm going to get back.
I'm going to get him back, I am.
I'm going to get him back, I really am. 

#O' Sailor

I'm undecided about you again.
Mightn't be right that you're not here.
It's double-sided, cause I ruined it all, but also saved myself, by never believing you, Dear.
Everything good, I deem too good to be true.
Everything else is just a bore.
Everything I have to look forward to has a pretty painful and very imposing before.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
I have too been playing with fifty-two cards. 
Just cause I play so far from my vest.
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard.
What could I do, but spend my best?
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees.
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me.
And in its wake, appeared the touch and call of a different breed, one who set to get me wise, and got me there, and then got me.
And what a thing, to know what could be instead.
Oh, what a blessed curse to see.
It took the agenda from its place in my bed, made a merry paramour of me.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
O' sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Giving me eyes to view it, as it goes by the boards.

#Better Version Of Me

The nickel dropped when I was on my way beyond the Rubicon.
What did I do?
And of the games that I can handle, none are ones worth the candle.
What should I do?
I'm a frightened, fickle person fighting, crying, kicking, cursing.
What should I do?
Oooh, after all the folderol, and hauling over coals stops, what will I do?
Can't take a good day without a bad one.
Don't feel just to smile until I've had one.
Where did I learn?
I make a fuss about a little thing.
The rhyme is losing to the riddling.
Where's the turn?
I don't want a home; I'd ruin that.
Home is where my habits have a habitat.
Why give it a turn?
Oh, after all the folderol, and hauling over coals stops what did I learn?
I am likely to miss the main eventif I stop to cry or complain again, so I will keep a deliberate pace, let the damned breeze dry my face.
Oh, mister, wait until you see what I'm going to be.
I've got a plan, a demand, and it just began, and if you're right, you'll agree.
Here's coming a better version of me.
Here it comes a better version of me.
Here it comes a better version of me.

#Tymps (The Sick In The Head Song)

Those boon times wentbust.
My feet of clay, they dried to dust.
The red isn't the red we painted; It's just rust.
And the signature thing that used to bring a following, I have trouble now even remembering.
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night, and keep on letting him change all my plans?
I'm either so sick in the head I need to be bled dry to quit, or I just really used to love him.
I sure hope thats it.
I knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch.
Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, its just mush.
And the signature thing is only growing harrowing.
I should have no trouble now to keep from following.
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night, and keep on letting him change all my plans?
I'm either so sick in the head I need to be bled dry to quit, or I just really used to love him.
I sure hope thats it.

I sure hope that's it.

#Parting Gift

I opened my eyes while you were kissing me once, more than once, and you looked as sincere as a dog.
Just as sincere as a dog does, when it's the food on your lips with which it's in love.
I bet you could never tell that I knew you didn't know me that well.
It is my fault, you see, you never learned that much from me.
Oh you silly, stupid pastime of mine, you were always good for a rhyme, and from the first to the last time, the signs said "Stop", but we wenton whole-hearted.
It ended bad, but I love what we started.
It said "Stop", but we wenton whole-hearted.
It ended bad, but I love what we started.
I took off my glasses while you were yelling at me once, more than once, so's not to see you see me react.
Should've put 'em, should've put 'em on again, so I could see you see me sincerely yelling back.
I bet your fortressed face belied your fort of lace.
It is by the grace of me you never learned what I could see.
Oh you silly, stupid pastime of mine, you were always good for a rhyme, and from the first to all the last times, all the signs said "Stop", but we wenton whole-hearted.
It ended bad, but I love what we started.
It said "Stop", but we wenton whole-hearted.
It ended bad, but I love what we started.

#Window

I was staring out the window the whole time he was talking to me.
It was a filthy pane of glass. 
I couldn't get a clear view.
And as he wenton and on, it wasn't the outside world I could see.
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through.
So I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
Better that I break the window than him or her or me.
I was never focused on just one thing.
My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft.
It may look like I'm concentrated on a very clear view, but I'm as good as asleep.
I bet you didn't know.
It takes a lot of it away, if you do.
I had to break the windo.
It just had to be.
Better that I break the window than him or her or me.
I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
It was in my way.
Better that I break the window than forget what I had to say, or miss what I should see.
Because the fact being that whatever's in frontof me is covering my view.
So I can't see what I'm seeing, in fact. 
I only see what I'm looking through.
So again I done the right thing.
I was never worried about that.
The answer's always been in clear view.
But even when the window was cleaned, I still can't see for the fact that when it's clean it's so clear, I can't tell what I'm looking through.
So I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
It was in my way.
Better that I break the window than him or her or me.
I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
Better that I break the window than miss what I should see.
I had to break the window.
It just had to be.
It was in my way.
Better that I break the window than forget what I had to say, or miss what I should see, or break him her or me.
Especially me.

#Oh Well

What you did to me made me see myself something different.
Though I try to talk sense to myself, but I just won't listen.
Won't you go away, Turn yourself in.
You're no good at confession.
Before the image that you burned me in tries to teach you a lesson.
What you did to me made me see myself something awful.
A voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled.
It took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it.
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems I've been outbidded.
My peace and quiet was stolen from me.
When I was looking with calm affection, you were searching out my imperfections.
What wasted unconditional love on somebody who doesn't believe in the stuff.
You came upon me like a hypnic jerk when I was just about settled.
And when it counts you recoil with a cryptic word and leave a love belittled.
Oh what a cold and common old way to go.
I was feeding on the need for you to know me; devastated at the rate you fell below me.
What wasted unconditional love on somebody who doesn't believe in the stuff.
Oh, well. 

#Please Please Please

Please, please, please, no more melodies.
They lack impact; they're petty.
They've been made up already.
Please, please, please, no more maladies.
I'm so tired of crying; you'd think I was a siren.
But me and everybody's on the sad same team and you can hear our sad brain screaming: Give us something familiar, something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady, steady, steady going nowhere.
Please, please, please, no apologies.
At best they buy you time till you next step out of line.
Please, please, please, no more remedies.
My method is uncertain; it's a mess but it's working.
And maybe if you tried it out, you won't like it when you're crying out: Give us something familiar something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady, steady, steady, steady going nowhere.
Please, please, please, no more melodies.

Please, please, please, no more remedies.
My method is uncertain.
It's a mess but it's working.
And maybe if you want to try it out
You won't like it when you're crying out: Give me something familiar, something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady, steady, steady, steady going nowhere.

#Red Red Red

I don't understand about complementary colors and what they say.
Side by side they both get bright.
Together they both get gray.
But he's been pretty much yellow, and I've been kinda blue, but all I can see is red, red, red, red, red now.
What am I going to do?
I don't understand about diamonds and why men buy them.
What's so impressive about a diamond except the mining?
And it's dangerous work trying to get to you too.
And I think if I didn't have to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it maybe I wouldn't think so much of you.
I've been watching all the time, and I still can't find the tack.
And I want to know: Is it okay?
Is it just fine?
Or is it my fault?
Is it my lack?
I don't understand about the weather outside, or the harmony in a tune, or why somebody lied.
There's solace a bit for submitting to the fitfully cryptically true.
What's happened has happened.
What's coming is already on its way with a role for me to play.
I don't understand.
I'll never understand, but I'll try to understand.
There's nothing else I can do.

#Not About Love

The early cars already are drawing deep breaths past my door, and last night's phrases sick with lack of basis are still writhing on my floor.
And it doesn't seem fair that your wicked words should work in holding me down.
No, it doesn't seem right to take information given at close range for the gag, and the bind and the ammunition round.
Conversation once colored by esteem became duologue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation, my palate got clean.
Now I could taste your agenda while you're spitting your cud.
And it doesn't make sense I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown.
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range for the gag, and the bind, and the ammunition round.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
I miss that stupid ache.
What is this posture I have to stare at.
That's what he said when I'm sitting up straight.
Change the name of the game because he lost, and he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late.
But I'm not being fair, because I chose to listen to that filthy mouth, but I'd like to choose right.
Take all the things that I've said that he stole, put 'em in a sack, swing 'em over my shoulder, turn on my heels, step out of this sight.
Try to live in a lovelier light.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
This is not about love.
'Cause I am not in love.
In fact I can't stop falling out.
I miss that stupid ache.

#Waltz (Better Than Fine)

If you don't have a song to sing, you're okay.
You know how to get along humming, hmmm.
If you don't have a date, celebrate.
Go out and sit on the lawn and do nothing.
'Cause it's just what you must do.
Nobody does it anymore.
No I don't believe in the wasting of time, but I don't believe that I'm wasting mine.
If you don't have a point to make, don't sweat it.
You'll make a sharp one being so kind.
And I'd sure appreciate it.
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed.
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm better than fine?

#Sleep to Dream

I tell you how I feel, but you don't care.
I say tell me the truth, but you don't dare.
You say love is a hell you cannot bear, and I say gimme mine back and then go there for all I care.
I got my feet on the ground, and I don't go to sleep to dream.
You got your head in the clouds, and you're not at all what you seem.
This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways, so don't forget what I told you: don't come around I got my own hell to raise.
I have never been so insulted in all my life.
I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride.
First you run like a fool just to be at my side, and now you run like a fool, but you just run to hide, and I can't abide.
I got my feet on the ground, and I don't go to sleep to dream.
You got your head in the clouds, and you're not at all what you seem.
This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways, so don't forget what I told you: don't come around I got my own hell to raise.
Don't make it a big deal.
Don't be so sensitive.
We're not playing a game anymore.
You don't have to be so defensive.
Don't you plead me your case.
Don't bother to explain.
Don't even show me your face because it's a crying shame.
Just go back to the rock from under which you came.
Take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim, and don't forget the blame.
I got my feet on the ground, and I don't go to sleep to dream.
You got your head in the clouds, and you're not at all what you seem.
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways, so don't forget what I told you: don't come around I got my own hell to raise.

#Sullen Girl

Days like this I don't know what to do with myself all day and all night.
I wander the halls along the walls and under my breath I say to myself I need fuel to take flight.
And there's too much going on, but it's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion, under the waves in the blue of my oblivion.
Is that why they call me a sullen girl, sullen girl.
They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea.
But he washed me ashore, and he took my pearl and left an empty shell of me.
And there's too much going on, but it's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion, under the waves in the blue of my oblivion, under the waves in the blue of my oblivion.
It's calm under the waves, in the blue of my oblivion.

#Shadowboxer

Once my lover, now my friend.
What a cruel thing to pretend.
What a cunning way to condescend.
Once my lover, and now my friend.
Oh, you creep up like the clouds and you set my soul at ease.
Then you let your love abound and you bring me to my knees.
Oh, it's evil, babe, the way you let your grace enrapture me.
When will you know I'd be insane to ever let that dirty game recapture me.
You made me a shadowboxer, baby.
I want to be ready for what you do.
I've been swinging all around me because I don't know when you're going to make your move.
Oh, your gaze is dangerous, and you fill your space so sweet.
If I let you get too close you'll set your spell on me.
So darling I just want to say, just in case I don't come through, I was on to every play.
I just wanted you.
But, oh, it's so evil, my love, the way you've no reverence to my concern.
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love, to save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn.
You made me a shadowboxer, baby.
I want to be ready for what you do.
I've been swinging all around me because I don't know when you're going to make your move.

#Criminal

I've been a bad, bad girl.
I've been careless with a delicate man.
And it's a sad, sad world when a girl will break a boy just because she can.
Don't you tell me to deny it.
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins.
I've come to you because I need guidance to be true and I just don't know where I can begin.
What I need is a good defense because I'm feeling like a criminal, and I need to be redeemed to the one I've sinned against because he's all I ever knew of love.
Heaven help me for the way I am.
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done.
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand.
But I keep living this day like the next will never come.
Oh help me but don't tell me to deny it.
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies till I'm good enough for him.
I've got a lot to lose, and I'm betting high, so I'm begging you before it ends just tell me where to begin.
What I need is a good defense because I'm feeling like a criminal, and I need to be redeemed to the one I've sinned against because he's all I ever knew of love.
Let me know the way before there's hell to pay.
Give me room to lay the law and let me go.
I've got to make a play to make my lover stay.
So what would an angel say?
The devil wants to know.
What I need is a good defense because I'm feeling like a criminal, and I need to be redeemed to the one I've sinned against because he's all I ever knew of love.
What I need is a good defense because I'm feeling like a criminal, and I need to be redeemed to the one I've sinned against because he's all I ever knew of love.

#Slow Like Honey

You moved like honey in my dream last night.
Yeah, some old fires were burning.
You came near to me and you endeared to me, but you couldn't quit discern me.
Does that scare you?
I'll let you run away, but your heart will not oblige you.
You'll remember me like a melody.
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you.
And my big secret: going to win you over, slow like honey, heavy with mood.
I'll let you see me.
I'll covet your regard.
I'll invade your demeanor, and you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze.
And you'll wonder what it is about me.
It's my big secre: keeping you coming, slow like honey, heavy with mood.
Though dreams can be deceiving, like faces are to hearts, they serve for sweet relieving when fantasy and reality lie too far apart.
So I stretch myself across like a bridge, and I pull you to the edge and stand there waiting, trying to attain the end to satisfy the story.
Shall I release you?
Must I release you as I rise to meet my glory?
But my big secret, going to hover over your life, going to keep you reaching, when I'm gone like yesterday, when I'm high like heaven, when I'm strong like music, because I'm slow like honey, and heavy with mood.

#The First Taste

I lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts waiting for the black to replace my blue.
I do not struggle in your web because it was my aim to get caught.
But daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growing weary of waiting to be consumed by you.
Give me the first taste.
Let it begin.
Heaven cannot wait forever.
Darling, just start the chase.
I'll let you win, but you must make the endeavour.
Oh, your love gives me a heart confusion.
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red.
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion.
I'm building memories on things we have not said.
Full is not heavy as empty, not nearly my love, not nearly my love, not nearly.
Give me the first taste.
Let it begin.
Heaven cannot wait forever.
Darling, just start the chase.
I'll let you win, but you must make the endeavour.

#Never Is A Promise

You'll never see the courage I know.
Its colors' richness won't appear within your view.
I'll never glow the way that you glow.
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you, but as the scenery grows, I see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception.
My feelings swell and stretch.
I see from greater heights.
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you.
You'll say you understand, but you don't understand.
You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye, but never is a promise and you can't afford to lie.
You'll never touch these things that I hold.
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own.
You'll never feel the heat of this soul.
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you.
You'll say: don't fear your dreams.
It's easier than it seems.
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high, but never is a promise and you can't afford to lie.
You'll never live the life that I live.
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night.
You'll never hear the message I give.
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight, but as the scenery grows, I see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception.
My feelings swell and stretch.
I see from greater heights.
I realise what I am now too smart to mention to you.
You'll say you understand.
You'll never understand.
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why.
I don't know what to believe in.
You won't know who I am.
You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry, but never is a promise and I'll never need a lie.

#The Child Is Gone

Darling, give me your absence tonight.
Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white.
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside, and don't bother leaving the light on because I suddenly feel like a different person.
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion, and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion, a vacancy that just did not belong.
The child is gone.
Honey help me out of this mess.
I'm a stranger to myself but don't reach for me.
I'm too far away.
I don't want to talk because there's nothing left to say.
So my darling, give me your absence tonight.
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside because there's no kind Of loving that can make this all right.
I'm trying to find a place I belong, and I suddenly feel like a different person.
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coersion, and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion.
As the darkness turns into the dawn, the child is gone, the child is gone.

#Pale September

Pale September.
I wore the time like a dress that year.
The autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin.
But as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappearred, my heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within.
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full, and sank in the burrows of my keep.
And all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet.
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep.
He goes along just as a water lily, gentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floats unweighed down by passion or intensity, yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts.
And he finds a home in me for what misfortune sows he knows my touch will reap.
And all my armour falling down in a pile at me feet.
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep.
All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet.
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep.

#Carrion

Won't do no good to hold no seance.
What's gone is gone, and you can't bring it back around.
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight.
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down.
Oh, honey, I've gone away.
Oh, honey, I've gone away.
Oh, honey, I've gone away.
Won't do no good to sing no love song.
No sound could simulate the presence of a man.
Won't do no good asking no questions.
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan.
Oh, honey I've gone away.
Honey, I've gone away.
Honey, I've gone away.
My feel for you, boy, is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered pery.
And all I want is to save you, honey, or the strength to walk away.
Won't do no good to go no distance.
The space between us is as boundless as the dark.
Won't do no good to throw no fists, babe.
You can't intimidate me back into your arms.
Because honey, I've gone away.
I've gone away.
I've gone away.
I've gone away.
I've gone away.
I've gone away.
My feel for you, boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey.
And all I want is to save you, honey or the strength to walk away.
My feel for you, boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey.
And all I want is to save you, honey or the strength to walk away.
My feel for you, boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey.
And all I want is to save you, honey or the strength to walk away.

#On the Bound

All my life is on me now.
Hail the pages turning.
And the future is on the bound.
Hell don't know my fury.
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need you're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need youre all I need - and maybe some faith would do me good.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Don't know, should I Change my mind?
I can't decide.
There's too many variations to consider.
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do.
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself.
I make it bitter.
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time.
Tell me you belong to me.
Baby say that it's all going to be alright.
I believe that it isn't. 
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need you're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need youre all I need - and maybe some faith would do me good, and maybe some faith would do me good, and maybe some faith would do me good.

#To Your Love

Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow.
Another cue for you to fold your ears.
Another train of thought too hard to follow, chugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gears.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is the evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance to your love, to your love, to your love.
I would've warned you, but really, what's the point?
Caution could, but rarely ever helps.
Don't be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint.
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance to your love, to your love, to your love.
My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you, but by the time I'm close to you, I lose my desideratum and now you, so now you have it.
So baby tell me what's the word?
Am I your gal, or should I get out of town?
I just need to be reassured.
Do you just deal it out, or can you deal with what I lay down?
Please forgive me, for my distance.
The pain is evident in my existence.
Please forgive me for my distance.
The shame is manifest in my resistance to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love, to your love.

#Limp

You want to make me sick.
You want to lick my wounds, don't you, baby?
You want the badge of honor when you save my hide, but you're the one in the way of the day of doom, baby, if you need my shame to reclaim your pride.
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists.
I never did anything to you, man.
But no matter what I try, you'll beat me with your bitter lies, so call me crazy, hold me down, make me cry; got off now, baby.
It wont be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands.
You feed the beast I have within me.
You wave the red flag, baby, you make it run, run, run.
Standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning, you fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun.
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists.
I never did anything to you, man.
But no matter what I try you'll beat me with your bitter lies so call me crazy, hold me down, make me cry; get off now, baby.
It wont be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands.
And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists.

#Love Ridden

Love ridden, I've looked at you with the focus I gave to my birthday candles.
I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow.
And baby, I wished for you.
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed, and I want to crawl in with you, but I cry instead.
I want your warm, but it will only make me colder when it's over.
So I can't tonight, baby.
No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on, and in a little while, we'll only have to wave.
My hand won't hold you down no more.
The path is clear to follow through.
I stood too long in the way of the door mp fiona apple, and now I'm giving up on you.
No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on, and in a little while, we'll only have to wave.
No, not "baby" anymore.
If I need you, I'll just use your simple name.
Only kisses on the cheek from now on, and in a little while, we'll only have to wave.

#Paper Bag

I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star to pray on, or wish on, or something like that.
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had.
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope, and I believed for a moment that my chances were approaching to be grabbed.
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear.
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag.
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love.
And I went crazy again today, looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope.
Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine, and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope.
I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified.
Come on put a little love here in my void." 
He said "It's all in your head,"
And I said, "So's everything", But he didn't get it.
I thought he was a man But he was just a little boy.
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love.
Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love.
Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess that he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving, it works, when it costs too much to love.

#A Mistake

I'm going to make a mistake.
I'm going to do it on purpose.
I'm going to waste my time. 
'Cause I'm full as a tick, and I'm scratching at the surface.
And what I find is mine.
And when the day is done, and I look back, and the fact is I had fun, fumbling around.
All the advice I shunned, and I ran where they told me not to run, but I sure had fun, so I'm going to fuck it up again.
I'm going to do another detour.
Unpave my path.
And if you want to make sense, what you looking at me for?
I'm no good at math.
And when I find my way back, the fact is I just may stay, or I may not.
I've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake.
I want to make mistake; why can't I make a mistake?
I'm always doing what I think I should.
Almost always doing everybody good.
Why?
Do I want to do right?
Of course, but do I really want to feel I'm forced to answer you?
hell no.
I've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake. 
I want to Make a mistake.
why can't I make a mistake?
I'm always doing what I think I should.
Almost always doing everybody good.
Why?

#Fast As You Can

I let the beast in too soon.
I don't know how to live without my hand on his throat.
I fight him always, and still, oh darling, it's so sweet, you think you know how crazy how crazy I am.
You say you don't spook easy; you won't go, but I know and I pray that you will.
Fast as you can, baby, run, free yourself of me, fast as you can.
I may be soft in your palm, but I'll soon grow hungry for a fight, and I will not let you win.
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will disprove your faith in man.
So if you catch me trying to find my way into your heart from under your skin, fast as you can, baby, scratch me out, free yourself, fast as you can.
Fast as you can, baby, scratch me out, free yourself, fast as you can.
Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift, but most of the time, it does.
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift, or I'll drown in the wonders and the was.
And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift.
And you give me some more of your drugs.
Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift.
'Cause I'm tired of whys, choking on whys.
Just need a little because, because...
I let the beast in, and then I even tried forgiving him, but it's too soon.
So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again.
And for a little while more, I'll soar the uneven wind, complain and blame the sterile land.
But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear I'm blooming within.
Fast as you can, baby, wait, watch me, I'll be out fast as I can, maybe late but at least about. 
Fast as you can leave me, let this thing run its route, fast as you can, fast as you can, fast as you can, fast as you can.

#The Way Things Are

I wouldn't know what to do with another chance if you gave it to me.
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance.
It'd race right through me.
I'm much better off the way things are.
Much, much better off, better by far, by far.
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice.
It'd roll right past me.
And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice so don't even ask me.
I'm much better off the way things are.
Much, much better off, better by far.
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on, and I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle, and as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be able to move on.
How can I fight, when we're on the same side?
How can I fight beside you?
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep on kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle, and as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be able to move on.
So keep on callng me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle, and as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be able to move on.

#Get Gone

How many times do I have to say to get away, get gone.
Flip your shit past another lasses' humble dwelling.
You got your game, made your shot, and you got away with a lot, but I'm not turned on.
So put away that meat you're selling.
'Cause I do know what's good for me, and I've done what I could for you, but you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting singing again, sing, sing, again.
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this?
Am I going to heal from this? 
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I got to get him out.
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.
'Cause I do know what's good for me, and I've done what I could for you, but you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting singing again, sing, sing again.

Am I going to heal from this? 
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I got to get him out.
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.
How many times can it escalate till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride, that I'm much obliged to up and go.
I'll idealize, then realize that it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid and there's nothing left to grieve.
Fucking go.
'Cause I've done what I could for you, and I do know what's good for me, and I'm not benefiting, instead I'm sitting singing again, singing again, singing again, sing, sing, sing again.
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this?
Am I going to heal from this?
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out. 
I got to get him out.
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.

It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.

#I Know

So be it.
I'm your crowbar if that's what I am so far, until you get out of this mess.
And I will pretend that I dont know of your sins until you are ready to confess.
But all the time, all the time, I'll know, I'll know.
And you can use my skin to bury secrets in, and I will settle you down.
And at my own suggestion, I will ask no questions while I do my thing in the background.
But all the time, all the time, I'll know, I'll know.
Baby, I can't help you out while she's still around.
So for the time being, I'm being patient.
And amidst this bitterness, if you'll just consider this, even if it don't make sense all the time, give it time.
And when the crowd becomes your burden, and you've early closed your curtains, I'll wait by the backstage door while you try to find the lines to speak your mind and pry it open, hoping for an encore.
And if it gets too late, for me to wait for you to find you love me and tell me so, it's ok, dont need to say it.
