Wish

This is the first day of my last days.
I built it up, now I take it apart. 
Climbed up real high now fall down real far.
No need for me to stay. 
The last thing left, I just threw it away.
I put my faith in God and my trust in you, now there's nothing more fucked up I could do.
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true.
Wish there was something real in this world full of you.
I'm the one without a soul. 
I'm the one with this big fucking hole.
No new tale to tell. 
Twenty-six years on my way to hell.
Gotta listen to your big time, hard line, bad luck, fist fuck.
Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me I hate everyone.
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true.
Wish there was something real in this world full of you.
I want to but I can't turn back, but I want to.


#Last

Gave up trying to figure out when my head got lost along the way.
Worn out from giving it up, and my soul I pissed it all away.
Still stings these shattered nerves, pigs we get what pigs deserve.
I'm going all the way down I'm leaving today.
Come, come, come on you've got to fill me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Come, come, come on, you're got to fix me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Still feel it all slipping away, but it doesn't matter anymore.
Everybody's still chipping away, but it doesn't matter anymore.
Look through these blackened eyes; you'll see ten thousand lies.
Come, come, come on you've got to fill me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Come, come, come on, you're got to fix me up.
Come, come, got to let me get through to you.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
I know it's all getting away, and it comes to me as no surprise.
I know what's coming to me, and is never going to arrive.
Fresh blood through tired skin, new sweat to drown me in.
Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive.
Come, come, come on you've got to fill me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Come, come, come on, you're got to fix me up.
Come, come, got to let me get through to you.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
I wish I could put the blame on you.
I want you to make me, I want you to take me, I want you to break me, then I want you to throw me away.
I want you to make me, I want you to take me, I want you to break me, then I want you to throw me away.


#Happiness In Slavery

Slave screams, he thinks he knows what he wants.
Slave screams, thinks he has something to say.
Slave screams, he hears but doesn't want to listen.
Slave screams, he's being beat into submission.
Don't open your eyes, you won't like what you see.
The devils of truth steal the souls of the free.
Don't open your eyes, take it from me. 
I have found, You can find, Happiness is slavery.
Slave screams, he spends his life learning conformity.
Slave screams, he claims he has his own identity.
Slave screams, he's going to cause the system to fall.
slave screams but he's glad to be chained to that wall.
Don't open your eyes, you won't like what you see.
The blind have been blessed with security.
Don't open your eyes, take it from me.
I have found, you can find, happiness is slavery.
I don't know what I am. 
I don't know where I've been.
Human junk, just words and so much skin.
Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine.
Just some flesh caught in this big, broken machine.


#Gave Up

perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most.
Forgot how it feels well almost.
No one to blame always the same.
Open my eyes. 
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up in flames.
It took you to make me realize.
It took you to make me realize.
It took you to make me realize.
It took you to make me see the light.
Smashed up my sanity.
Smashed up my integrity.
Smashed up what I believed in.
Smashed up what's left of me.
Smashed up my everything.
Smashed up all that was true.
Gonna smash myself to pieces, I don't know what else to do.
Covered in hope and vaseline, still cannot fix this broken machine.
Watching the hole it used to be mine.
Just watching it burn in my steady, systematic decline of the trust I will betray.
Give it to me I throw it away.
And after everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become.
I tried, I gave up.
I tried, I gave up.
I tried, I gave up.
I tried, and I gave up.
Throw it away.


#Physical (You're So)

I want to take you baby.
I want to take you out.
I want to wine and dine you.
Oh, I want to twist, and twist and shout.
I want you hot in my arms.
So soft on my bed.
You get the key to my heart, oh, when you wear that sweet dress.
But you're too physical, physical to me.
You're just too physical, physical no to me.
I want your rough house baby.
I want this right in your ear.
You let me feel your danger.
I let you make this feeling clear here.
I want the touch of your charms, the heat of your breath.
I want to say all those things that would be better unsaid.
But you're too physical, physical to me.
You're just too physical, oh.
You're too physical for me.
You're too physical to me.
You're really just just too just too really, fuck no!
You're just too physical.
You're just too physical. 
Too fucking physical.
No, no no no no no no.
Oh you're too physical.
Just too physical.
Just too.


#Suck

There is no God up in the sky tonight.
No sign of heaven anywhere in sight.
All that was true is left behind.
Once I could see now I am blind.
Don't want your dreams you try to sell.
This disease I give to myself.
How does it feel? 
How does it feel?
She makes it sweeter than the sun.
I get too tight I come undone.
I bow my head to confess.
The temple walls are made of flesh.
Runs up my arms 'til I'm on track.
Itches my skin right off of my back.
I'll heal your wounds.
I'll set you free.
I'm Jesus Christ on ecstasy.
How does it feel?
How does it feel? 
I am so dirty on on the inside.
I am so dirty on on the inside. 
I am so dirty on on the inside. 
I am so dirty on on the inside. 
How does it feel?
How does it feel? 
Suck, suck, suck, suck.
A thousand lips, a thousand tongues, a thousand throats, a thousand lungs, a thousand ways to make it true I want to do terrible things to you.

#Head Like a Hole

God money I'll do anything for you.
God money just tell me what you want me to.
God money nail me up against the wall.
God money don't want everything he wants it all.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
Bow down before the one you serve.
You're going to get what you deserve.
Bow down before the one you serve.
You're going to get what you deserve.
God money's not looking for the cure.
God money's not concerned with the sick amongst the pure.
God money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised.
God money's not one to choose.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole.
Black as your soul.
I'd rather die than give you control.
You know who you are.


#Terrible lie

Hey God, why are you doing this to me?
Hey God, am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?
Why am I seething with this animosity?
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology.
Terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie.
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean.
Hey God, seems like salvation comes only in our dreams.
Hey God, I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme.
Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems?
Terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie.
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to.
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to.
Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide.
Hey God, I lost my ignorance, security and pride.
Hey God, I'm all alone in a world you must despise.
Hey God, I believed your promises, your promises and lies.
Terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie, terrible lie.
You made me throw it all away, my morals left to decay.
How many you betray.
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease.
My skin is begging you please.
I'm on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe.
I give you everything.
My sweet everything.


#Down in it

Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky, and I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.
Sometimes I don't believe them myself, and I decided i was never coming down. 
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.
It was just about too small to see, but I watched it way too long. 
It was pulling me down.  
I was up about it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it.
Well shut up. 
So what, what does it matter now? 
I was swimming in the haze now I crawl on the ground. 
And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me. 
Try to laugh about it now, but isn't it funny how everything works out. 
"I guess the joke's on me," she said.
I was up about it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it.
I used to be so big and strong.
I used to know my right from wrong.
I used to never be afraid.
I used to be somebody
I used to have something inside.
Now just this hole that's open wide.
I used to want it all.
I used to be somebody.
I'll cross my heart and hope to die, but the needle's already in my eye. 
And all the world's weight is on my back, and I don't even know why. 
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory.
I looked him right in the eye and said goodbye.
 was up about it.
I was up above it.
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it.
I was up above it. 
Now I'm down in it.


#Sanctified

It's still getting worse after everything I tried.
What if I found a way to wash it all aside?
What if she touches with those fingertips as the words spill out like fire from her lips.
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
Inside you.
Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.
I still dream of lips I never should have never kissed.
Well she knows exactly what I can't resist
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
Inside you.
I'm just caught up in another of her spells.
While she's turning me into someone else.
Everyday I hope and pray this will end,  but when I can I do it all again.
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.
I am justified. 
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
Inside you.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified. 
Inside you.


#Something I Can Never Have

I still recall the taste of my tears.
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just to thing, and I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go away.
You make it all go away.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have.
You always were the one to show me how.
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now.
This thing is slowly take me apart.
Grey would be the color if I had a heart.
Come on, tell me.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just to thing, and I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go away.
You make it all go away.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have.
In this place it seems like such a same.
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same.
Everywhere I look you're all I see.
Just a fading, fucking reminder of who I used to be.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just to thing, and I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go away.
You make it all go away.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have.
I just want something I can never have.


#Kinda I Want To

I can't shake this feeling from my head.
There's a devil sleeping in my bed.
He's watching you from across the way.
I cannot make this feeling go away.
I know it's not the right thing, and I know it's not the good thing but kinda I want to.
I'm not sure of what I should do when everything I'm think of is you.
All of my excuses turn to lies.
Maybe God will cover up his eyes
I know it's not the right thing, and I know it's not the good thing but kinda I
want to.
And I want to, maybe just for tonight.
We can pretend it's alright.
What's the price I pay?
I don't care what they say.
I want to.
I want to.


#Sin

You give me the reason.
You give me control.
I gave you my Purity, and my Purity you stole.
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise.
Am I just too stupid to realize.
Stale incense, old sweat and lies, lies, lies.
It comes down to this, your kiss, your fist.
And your strain, it get's under my skin, within, take in, the extent of my sin.
You give me the anger.
You give me the nerve.
To carry out the sentence, while I get what I deserve.
I'm just an effigy to be defaced, to be disgraced.
Your need for me has been replaced.
And if I can't have everything well that just gives me a taste.
It comes down to this, your kiss, your fist.
And your strain, it get's under my skin, within, take in, the extent of my sin.


#That's What I Get

Just when everything was making sense, you took away all my self-confidence.
Now all that I've been hearing must be true.
I guess I'm not the only boy for you.
But that's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
How could you turn us into this, after you just taught me how to kiss you.
I told you I'd never say goodbye.
Now I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.
But's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
Why does it come as a surprise to think that I was so naive.
Maybe didn't mean so much.
but it meant everything to me.
But's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.


#The Only Time

I'm drunk,  and right now I'm so in love with you.
And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do.
Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars, while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.
Nothing quite like the feel of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
I swear,  I just found everything I need.
The sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me.
Well I want to drink it up and swim in it until I drown, my immoral standing is lying down.
Nothing quite like the feel of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.


#Ringfinger

Well you've got me working so heard lately.
Working my hands until they bleed.
If I was twice the man I could be.
I'd still be half of what you need.
Still you lead me and I follow.
Anything you ask you know I'll do.
But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone, and offer it to me.
Well you just left me nailed here hanging like Jesus on the cross.
I'll be dying for your sins.
And aiding to the cause.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone, and offer it to me.
Wrap my eyes in bandages as confessions I see through.
I get everything I want when I get part of you.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone, and offer it to me.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
ringfinger, devil's flesh and bone do something for me.

#Piggy

Hey pig, yeah you.
Hey pig piggy pig pig pig, all of my fears came true.
Black and blue and broken boned, you left me here I'm all alone.
My little piggy needed something new.
Nothing can stop me now cause I don't care anymore.
Nothing can stop me now cause I just don't care.
Hey pig.
Nothing's turning out the way I planned.
Hey pig, there's a lot of things I hoped you could help me understand.
What am I supposed to do? 
I lost my shit because of you.
Nothing can stop me now cause I don't care anymore.
Nothing can stop me now cause I just don't care.

Nothing can stop.


#Heresy

He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see.
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me.
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity.
He dreamed up a god and called it Christianity.
Your god is dead, and no one cares. 
If there is a hell I'll see you there.
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line.
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine.
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering, and pain demands devotion atrocities done in his name.
Your god is dead and no one cares.
If there is a hell, I'll see you there.
Your god is dead and no one cares.
If there is a hell, I'll see you there.
God is dead.
God is dead.
God is dead.
God is dead.
God is dead.
Your god is dead and no one cares.
If there is a hell, I'll see you there.
Your god is dead and no one cares.
Drowning in his own hypocrisy.
And if there is a hell I will see you there.
Burning with your god in humility.
Will you die for this?


#March of The Pigs

Step right up, march, push, crawl right up on your knees, please, greed, feed (no time to hesitate).
I want a little bit. 
I want a piece of it. 
I think he's losing it.
I want to watch it come down.
Don't like the look of it. 
Don't like the taste of it.
Don't like the smell of it.
I want to watch it come down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
Shove it up inside, surprise! 
Lies.
Stains like the blood on your teeth.
Bite, chew, suck, away the tender parts.
I want to break it up.
I want to smash it up.
I want to fuck it up.
I want to watch it come down.
Maybe afraid of it.
Let's discredit it. 
Let's pick away at it.
I want to watch it come down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you al that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
The pigs have won tonight.
Now they can all sleep soundly.
And everything is all right.


#Closer

You let me violate you.
You let me desecrate you.
You let me penetrate you.
You let me complicate you.
Help me I broke apart my insides. 
Help me I’ve got no soul to sell.
Help me the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
I want to feel you from the inside.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
my whole existence is flawed.
You get me closer to god.
You can have my isolation. 
You can have the hate that it brings.
You can have my absence of faith.
You can have my everything.
Help me tear down my reason. 
Help me it's your sex I can smell.
Help me you make me perfect. 
Help me become somebody else.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
I want to feel you from the inside.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
My whole existence is flawed.
You get me closer to god.
Through every forest, above the trees, within my stomach, scraped off my knees. 
I drink the honey inside your hive. 
You are the reason I stay alive.


#Ruiner

You had all of them on your side, didn't you?
You believe in all your lies, didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove. 
He's got nothing to lose, and now he made you believe.
The ruiner's your only friend. 
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives.
The raping of the innocent; you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees.
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease.
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd you get so long?
You had to give them all a sign, didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine, didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector. 
He's an infector, serving his shit to his flies.
Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize.
Maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go.
And maybe that fucked me up so much more than you'll ever know.
How'd you get so big?
How'd you get so strong?
How'd you get so hard?
How'd you get so long?
What you gave to me, my perfect ring of scars.
You know I can see what you really are.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop me now.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop me now.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop me now.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can hurt me.
You didn't hurt me. 
Nothing can stop.


#The Becoming

I beat my machine. 
It's a part of me.
It's inside of me
I'm stuck in this dream.
It's changing me. 
I am becoming.
The me that you know had some second thoughts.
He's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore.
The me that you know doesn't come around much.
That part of me isn't here anymore.
All pain disappears. 
It's the nature of, of my circuitry.
Drowns out all I hear.
There's no escape from this, my new consciousness.
The me that you know used to have feelings, but the blood has stopped pumping, and he is left to decay.
The me that you know is now made up of wires.
And even when I'm right with you, I'm so far away.
I can try to get away, but I’ve strapped myself in.
I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears.
I can see it killing away all my bad parts.
I don't want to listen but it's all too clear.
Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid.
Annie, hold a little tighter I might just slip away.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.
It won't give up it wants me dead.
Goddamn this noise inside my head.


#I Do Not Want This

I'm losing ground.
You know how this world can beat you down.
I'm made of clay.
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way.
I'm always falling down the same hill.
Bamboo puncturing this skin and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in.
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face.
If I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
You don't know just how I feel.
I stay inside my bed.
I have lived so many lives all in my head.
Don't tell me that you care.
There really isn't anything now, is there?
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer, to those who know what it really feels like, to those who've had a taste like that means something.
And oh so sick I am.
And maybe I don't have a choice.
And maybe that is all I have.
And maybe this is a cry for help.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
You don't know just how I feel.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.


#Big Man with A Gun

I am a big man, yes I am,  and I have a big gun.
Got me a big old Dick, and I, I like to have fun.
Held against your forehead.
I'll make you suck it.
Maybe I'll put a hole in your head you know, just for the fuck of it.
I can reduce you if I want.
I can devour.
I'm hard as fucking steel, and I’ve got the power.
I'm every inch a man, and I'll show you somehow.
Me and my fucking gun.
Nothing can stop me now.
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, I am  gunna come all over you.
Nothing can stop me now.
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, I am  gunna come all over you.
Nothing can stop me now.
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, I am  gunna come all over you.
Nothing can stop me now.
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, I am  gunna come all over you.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.
Me and my fucking gun.


#Eraser

Need you.
Dream you.
Find you.
Taste you.
Fuck you.
Use you.
Scar you.
Break you.
Lose me.
Hate me.
Smash me.
Erase me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.


#Reptile

She spread herself wide open to let the insects in.
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been.
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin.
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within.
Oh, my beautiful liar, oh my precious whore, my disease my infection, I am so impure.
Devils speak of the ways in which she'll manifest.
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress.
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness.
I now know the depths I reach are limitless.
Oh my beautiful liar, oh my precious whore, my disease my infection, I am so impure.
Oh, oh, my beautiful liar, oh my precious whore, my disease my infection, I am so impure.
Oh, my beautiful liar, oh my precious whore, my disease my infection, I am so impure.


#The Downward Spiral

He couldn't believe how easy it was.
He put the gun into his face.
Bang!
So much blood from such a tiny little hole.
Problems do have solutions, you know.
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash.
Everything's blue.
Everything's blue in this world.
The deepest shade of mushroom blue.
All fuzzy, spilling out of my head.


#Hurt

I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting.
Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.
What have I become,  my sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away in the end.
You could have it all, my empire of dirt.
I will let you down. 
I will make you hurt.
I wear this crown of shit upon my liar's chair.
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
Beneath the stain of time, the feeling disappears.
You are someone else. 
I am still right here.
What have I become,  my sweetest friend?
Everyone I know goes away in the end.
You could have it all my empire of dirt.
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
If I could start again a million miles away, I would keep myself.
I would find a way.


#Burn

This world rejects me.
This world threw me away.
This world never gave me a chance.
This world going to have to pay.
Well I don't believe in your institutions.
I did what you wanted me to.
And like the cancer in your system.
I've got a little surprise for you.
Something inside of me has opened up its eyes.
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realise?
This thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound.
Sometimes I think I could.
Burn.
Burn.
I look down there where you're standing.
Flock of sheep all on display.
With all your lies piled up around you.
I can take it all away.
Something inside of me has opened up its eyes.
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realise?
This thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound.
Sometimes I think I could.
I'm going to burn this whole world down.
I'm going to burn this whole world down.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I am your savior.
I am corruption.
I am the angel of your destruction.
I am perversion, secret desire.
I am your future swallowed up in fire.


#Dead Souls

Someone take these dreams away that point me to another day.
A duel of personalities that stretch all true reality.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
When figures from the past stand tall, and mocking voices ring the hall.
Imperialistic house of prayer. 
Conquistadors who took their share.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.

#Beginning Of The End

Down on your knees you'll be left behind.
This is the beginning.
Watch what you think they can read your mind.
This is the beginning.
I got my mark; see it in my eyes.
This is the beginning.
My reflection I don't recognize.
This is the beginning.
We think we climb so high all up the backs we've condemned.
We face our consequence.
This is the beginning of the end.
You wait your turn, you'll be last in line.
This is the beginning.
Get out the way cause I'm getting mine.
This is the beginning.
God helps the ones that help themselves.
This is the beginning.
May be too late as far as I can tell.
This is the beginning.
We think we've come so far.
On all our lies we depend.
We face our consequence.
This is the beginning of the end.


#Survivalism

I should have listened to her.
So hard to keep control.
We kept on eating but our bloated belly's still not full.
She gave us all she had, but we went and took some more.
Can't seem to shut her legs.
Our mother nature is a whore.
I got my propaganda.
I got revisionism.
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
All a part of this great nation.
I got my fist.
I got my plan.
I got survivalism.
Hypnotic sound of sirens echoing through the street. 
The cocking of the rifles, the marching of the feet.
You see your world on fire.
Don't try to act surprised.
We did just what you told us.
Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies.
I got my propaganda. 
I got revisionism.
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
All a part of this great nation.
I got my fist.
I got my plan.
I got survivalism.
All bruised and broken, bleeding, she asked to take my hand.
I turned, just keep on walking, but you'd do the same thing in the circumstance.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I got my propaganda. 
I got revisionism.
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
All a part of this great nation.
I got my fist.
I got my plan.
I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
I got survivalism.


#The Good Soldier

Gun fire in the street where we used to meet echos out a beat, and the bass goes...
Bomb, right over my head, step over the dead.
Remember what you said, you know, the part about life is just a waking dream, well I know what you mean, but that be not how it seems right here right now.
How can all this be real?
I can barely feel anymore.
I am trying to see.
I am trying to believe.
This is not where I should be.
I am trying to believe.
Blood hardens in the sand.
Cold metal in my hand may help you understand the way that things are going to be.
There's nowhere else to hide cause god is on our side, I keep telling myself.
I am trying to see.
I am trying to believe.
This is not where I should be.
I am trying to believe.


#Vessel

I let you put it in my mouth.
I let it get under my skin.
I let you pump it through my veins.
I let you take me from within.
They tell you what we can and cannot do.
Same thing we've heard a hundred times before.
When I put you inside of me, none of that matters anymore.
My god, can I go any faster?
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here.
I am you, and you are me.
We will never be alone.
I have finally found my place in everything.
I have finally found my home.
I can leave all of this flesh behind.
I can see right through this whole facade.
I am becoming something else.
I am turning into God.
My god can I go any faster?
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here.


#Me, I'm Not

Well it's happening.
Never planned on this.
You've got something I need, kind of dangerous.
And I'm losing control.
I'm not used to this.
What you want from me.
I'm not used to this.
I can't shut it off this thing I've begun.
And it's hard to tell just where it's coming from.
And it's hard to see what I'm capable of.
And it's hard to believe just what I've become.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not
I can swallow it down, keep it all inside.
I define myself by how well I hide.
I feel it coming apart.
Well, at least I tried.
I can win this war by knowing not to fight.
If I take it all back, someway, somehow.
If I knew back then what I know right now.
Hey can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not.


#Capital G

I pushed a button and elected him to office, and he pushed a button and it dropped a bomb.
You pushed the button and could watch it on the television.
Those motherfuckers didn't last too long, ha ha.
I'm sick of hearing about the haves and the have-nots.
Have some personal accountability.
The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is the more we let you have, the less that I'll be keeping for me.
Well I used to stand for something, now I'm on my hands and knees.
Traded in my god for this one, and he signs his name with a capital G.
Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala.
Don't really see what all the fuss is about.
Aing. going to worry 'bout no future generations, and I'm sure somebody going to figure it out.
Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person, you haven't had enough to know what it's like.
You're only angry cause you wish you were in my position.
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right, alright!
Well I used to stand for something, but forgot what that could be.
There's a lot of me inside you.
Maybe you're afraid to see.
Well I used to stand for something, now I'm on my hands and knees.
Traded in my god for this one, and he signs his name with a capital G.


#My Violent Heart

You and I, we may look the same, but we are very far apart.`
There's bullet holes where my compassion used to be, and there is violence in my heart.
Into fire you can send us.
From the fire we return.
You can label us a consequence of how much you have to learn.
You can try but, you'll never understand.
This is something you will never understand.
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now.
Can you hear it now?
On hands and knees, we crawl.
You can not stop us all.
Our bones, our skin.
We will not let you in.
You have set something in motion, now.
Much greater than you've ever known.
Standing there in all your grand naivety, about to reap what you have sown.
Time will feed upon your weaknesses, and soon you'll lose the will to care.
When you return to the place that you call home, we will be there. 
We will be there.
On hands and knees, we crawl.
You can not stop us all.
Our blood will stain.
We will not go away.
On hands and knees, we crawl.
You can not stop us all.
Our blood, our ways will never leave this place.


#The Warning

Some say it was a warning.
Some say it's a sign.
I was standing right there when it came down from the sky.
The way it spoke to us, you felt it from inside.
Said it was up to us, up to us to decide.
"You've become a virus, killing off his host.
We been watching you with all our eyes and what you seem to value most.
So much potential, or so we used to say.
Your greed, self-importance, and your arrogance, you piss it all away.
We heard her cry.
We have come to intervene.
You will change your ways and you will make amends, or we will wipe this place clean!"
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away, ticking away.


#God Given

Hey man, please don't make a sound.
Take a look around.
Can't you see what's right in front of you?
Ah, have a little taste.
No more time to waste.
You don't want to get left behind cause it's all coming down right now.
How hard is it to see?
Put your faith in me.
I sure wouldn't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood.
You should get where you belong.
Everything you know is wrong.
Come on, sing along, everybody now.
God given!
And he gives us sight, and we see the light, and it burns so bright.
Now we know we're right.
When his kingdom come, and thy will be done, we have just begun.
We're the chosen ones.
I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you.
Wait, step into the light.
How can this be right?
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave.
Guess you can not win, with the color of your skin.
You won't be getting in to the promised land.
Besides this is just another case, you people still don't know your place.
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face.
We are the devine. 
Separated from the swine.
Come on, sing along, everybody now.
God given!
And he gives us sight, and we see the light, and it burns so bright. 
Now we know we're right.
When his kingdom come, and thy will be done, we have just begun. 
We're the chosen ones.
And he gives us sight.
And we see the light.
And it burns so bright.
Now we know we're right.
When his kingdom come, and thy will be done, and the father and the holy son, we're the chosen ones.
I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you.


#Meet Your Master

Bow down in position against the polished steel.
This is something different.
You'll like this way this feels.
No time for asking questions.
No time for wondering.
We've heard enough from you now.
We've heard everything.
We're going to play a new game.
You'll put on this blindfold.
You'll do what we tell you.
You'll do as your told.
Used to be the leader.
Now comes the time to serve.
Maybe we show some mercy.
Maybe you get what you deserve.
Count down to the end, got to make it come faster, faster.
Right around the bend is a coming disaster.
Count down to the end, and we're headed there faster.
Come on down, my friend.
It's time to meet your master.
You've left quite a mess here under your stewardship.
You thought you'd figured it out, but you'll learn your place in this.
Might take some convincing for you to see the truth.
There are so many things that we've got in store for you.
Count down to the end, got to make it come faster, faster.
Right around the bend, is a coming disaster.
Count down to the end, and we're headed there faster, faster.
Come on down, my friend.
It's time to meet your master.


#The Greater Good

Breathe us in.
Slowly, slowly.
Persuasion.
Coercion.
Submission.
Assimilation.
Welcome to your new point of view.
We have disappeared into you.
Everything you do, everywhere you go, anything you want, anything.
Everything you do, everywhere you go, anything you want, anything.
Everything you do, everywhere you go, anything you want, anything.
Everything you do, everywhere you go, anything you want, anything.
Breathe us in.
Slowly, slowly.
Breathe us in.
Slowly, slowly.
Now it's all just a matter of time.


#The Great Destroyer

Say your name, try to speak as clearly as you can.
You know, everything gets written down.
Nod your head, just in case they could be watching with their shiny satellites.
I hope they cannot see the limitless potential living inside of me to murder everything.
I hope they cannot see, I am the great destroyer.
Turn it up, listen to the shit they pump into your head, filling you with apathy.
Hold your breath.
Wait until you know the time is right. 
On time, the end is near.
I hope they cannot see the limitless potential living inside of me. 
I murder everything.
I hope they cannot see, I am the great destroyer.


#In This Twilight

Watch the sun, as it crawls across a final time.
And it feels like, like it was a friend.
It is watching us, and the world we set on fire.
Do you wonder if it feels the same?
And the sky is filled with light.
Can you see it?
All the black is really white, if you believe it.
As your time is running out, let me take away your doubt.
You can find a better a place in this twilight.
From dust to dust, ashes in your hair remind me what it feels like and I won't feel again.
Night descends.
Could I have been a better person?
If I could only do it all again.
And the sky is filled with light.
Do you see it?
All the black is really white, if you believe it.
And the longing that you feel. 
You know none of this is real.
You will find a better a place in this twilight.


#Zero-Sum

They're starting to open up the sky.
They're starting to reach down through.
And it feels like we're living in that split-second of a car crash.
And time is slowing down.
And if we only had a little more time.
And this time is all there is.
Do you remember the time we...
And all the times we...
And should have...
And were going to...
I know, and I know you remember how we could justify it all, and we knew better.
In our hearts we knew better.
And we told ourselves it didn't matter, and we chose to continue, and none of this matters anymore in the hour of our twilight.
And soon it will be all said and done.
And we will all be back together as one.
If we will continue at all.
Shame on us, doomed from the start.
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts.
Shame on us for all we've done, and all we ever were, just zeros and ones.
And you never get away.
And you never get to take the easy way.
And all of this is a consequence brought on by our own hand, if you believe in that sort of thing.
And did you ever really find, when you closed your eyes, any place that was still and at peace?
And I guess I just wanted to tell you, as the light starts to fade, that you are the reason that I am not afraid.
And I guess I just wanted to mention, as the heavens will fall, we will be together soon if we will be anything at all.
Shame on us, doomed from the start.
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts.
Shame on us for all we've done, and all we ever were, just zeros and ones.
