#i do n't believe you i ca n't understand . 
he let go of me hand and leave me here face the wall . 
i 'd sure like to know why he do go , but i ca n't get close to he at all . 
though we kiss through the wild , blaze night-time , he say he will never forget . 
but now morning be clearly . 
it 's like i be not here . 
he act like we never meet . 
it 's all new to me , like some mystery . 
it can even be like a myth . 
but it 's hard to think on this he 's the same one this last night i be with . 
from darkness , dream be desert . 
be i still dream yet ? 
i wish he 'd unlock he voice once and talk instead of act like we never meet . 
if he be not feel well , then why do n't he tell instead of turn he back to me face ? 
without any doubt he seem too far out for me to return to or chase . 
and he skirt , it sway as the guitar play . 
he mouth be watery and wet . 
but now something have change for he be not the same . 
he just act like we never have meet . 
if i do n't have to guess , i 'd gladly confess to anything i may 've try . 
if i be with he too long or have do something wrong , i 'd wish he 'd tell me what it be .

" i 'll say , "it 's easily do . 
you just pick anyone and pretend this you never have meet . 
" #ballad in plain d i once love a girl . 
he skin , it be bronze . 
with the innocence of a lamb , he be gentle like a fawn . 
i court he proudly , but now he be go , go as the season he 's take . 
in a young summer 's youth , i steal he away from he mother and sister , though close do they stay . 
each one of they suffer from the failure of they day , with string of guilt they try hard to guide we . 
of the two sister , i love the young . 
with sensitive instinct , he be the creative one . 
the constant scapegoat , he be easily undo by the jealousy of others around he . 
for he parasite sister i have no respect . 
bind by he boredom , he pride to protect , countless vision of the other he 'd reflect as a crutch for he scene and he society . 
me , for what i do i can be excuse . 
the change i be go through ca n't even be use for the lie this i tell he in hope not to lose the could-be dream-lover of me lifetime . 
with unseen consciousness i possess in me grip a magnificent mantelpiece , though it heart be chip , notice not this i 'd already slip to the sin of love 's false security . 
from silhouette anger to manufacture peace , answer of emptiness , voice vacancy , till the tombstone of damage read no question but , "please , what 's wrong ? 
what 's exactly the matter ? 
" and so it do happen like it can have be foresee , the timeless explosion of fantasy 's dream . 
at the peak of the night the king and the queen tumble all down into piece . 
" the tragic figure ! 
" he sister do shout . 
"leave he alone . 
goddam you . 
get out ! 
" and i , in me armor , turn about and nail he in the ruin of he pettiness . 
beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster do pound , he sister and i in a scream battleground and he in between , the victim of sound , soon shatter as a child to the shadow . 
" all be go . 
all be go . 
admit it . 
take flight ! 
" i gag in contradiction , tear blind me sight . 
me mind , it be mangle . 
i run into the night , leave all of love 's ash behind me . 
the wind knock me window . 
the room , it be wet . 
the word to say "i 'm sorry " i have n't find yet . 
i think of he often and hope whoever he 's meet will be fully aware of how precious he be . 
ah , me friend from the prison , they ask unto me , "how good , how good do it feel to be free ? 
" and i answer they more mysteriously , "are bird free from the chain of the skyway ? 
" #it be not me , babe go away from me window .

#visions of johanna aing .

we all sit here strand , though we 're all do we well to deny it . 
and louise hold a handful of rain , tempt you to defy it .

just louise and he lover so entwine and this vision of johanna this conquer me mind . 
in the empty lot where the lady play blindman 's bluff with the keychain and the all-night girl , they whisper of escapade out on the d-train , we can hear the night-watchman click he flashlight , ask he if it 's he or they this 's insane . 
louise , he 's alright . 
he 's just near . 
he 's delicate and seem like the mirror , but he just make it all too concise and too clearly this johanna 's not here . 
the ghost of electricity howl in the bone of he face , where this vision of johanna have now take me place .

he like to live dangerously and , when bring he name up , he speak of a farewell-kiss to me . 
he 's sure get a lot of gall to be so useless and all , mutter small talk at the wall while i 'm in the hall . 
oh , how can i explain ? 
it 's so hard to get on and this vision of johanna , they keep me up past the dawn . 
inside the museum infinity go up on trial . 
voice echo , " this be what salvation must be like after a while . 
" but mona lisa must 've have the highway blue . 
you can tell by the way he smile . 
see the primitive wallflower freeze when the jelly-faced woman all sneeze . 
hear the one with the must 'veche say , "jeez , i ca n't find me knee . 
" oh , jewel and binoculars hang from the head of the mule , but this vision of johanna , they make it all seem so cruel . 
the peddler now speak to the countess who 's pretend to care for he , say , "name me someone this 's not a parasite and i 'll go out and say a prayer for he . 
" but , like louise always say , "you ca n't look at much , can you , man ? 
" as he he prepare for he , and madonna , he still have not show . 
we see this empty cage now corrode , where he cape of the stage once have flow . 
the fiddler , he now step to the road . 
he write "everything 's be return which be owe " on the back of the fish truck this load while me conscience explode . 
the harmonica play the skeleton key in the rain and this vision of johanna be now all this remain .

i pity the poor immigrant who trample through the mud , who fill he mouth with laugh and who build he town with blood , who vision in the final end must shatter like the glass . 
i pity the poor immigrant when he gladness come to pass .

#dirge i hate me for love you and the weakness this it show . 
you be just a paint face on a trip down suicide road . 
the stage be set . 
the light wend out all around the old hotel . 
i hate me for love you and i 'm glad the curtain fall . 
i hate this foolish game we play and the need this be express and the mercy this you show to me . 
who ever will have guess ? 
i wend out on low broadway and i feel this place within , this hollow place where martyr weep and angel play with sin . 
hear you song of freedom and man , forever strip , act out he folly while he back be be whip . 
like a slave in orbit , he 's beat till he 's tame . 
all for a moment 's glory and it 's a dirty , rotten shame . 
there be this who worship loneliness . 
i 'm not one of they . 
in this age of fiberglass i 'm search for a gem . 
the crystal ball upon the wall have n't show me nothing yet . 
i 've pay the price of solitude , but at less i 'm out of debt . 
i ca n't recall a useful thing you ever do for me , except pat me on the back one time when i be on me knee . 
we stare into each other 's eye till one of we will break . 
no use to apologize . 
what difference will it make ? 
so , sing you praise of progress and of the doom-machine . 
the naked truth be still taboo whenever it can be see . 
lady luck , who shine on me , will tell you where i 'm at . 
i hate me for love you , but i should get over this . 
#you angel you you angel , you , you get me under you wing . 
the way you walk and the way you talk i feel i can almost sing . 
you angel , you , you 're as fine as anything 's fine . 
i just walk and watch you talk with you memory on me mind . 
and , though i ca n't sleep at night for try , yes , i never do feel this way before , never do get up and walk the floor . 
if this be love , then give me more and more and more and more and more . 
you angel , you , you 're as fine as can be . 
the way you walk and the way you talk be the way it ought to be . 
and , though i ca n't sleep at night for try , never do feel this way before , never do get up and walk the floor . 
if this be love , then give me more and more and more and more . 
you angel , you , you get me under you wing . 
the way you walk and the way you talk , i swear , it will make me sing . 
#never say goodbye twilight on the freeze lake , a north wind about to break on footprint in the snow and silence down below . 
you 're beautiful beyond word . 
you 're beautiful to me . 
you can make me cry . 
never say goodbye because me dream be make of iron and steel with a big bouquet of the rose hang down from the heaven to the grind . 
the crash wave roll over me as i stand upon the sand and wait for you to come and grab hold of me hand .

love you more than madness , more than dream upon the sea . 
i love you more than life it . 
you mean this much to me . 
ever since you walk right in , the circle 's be complete . 
i say goodbye to haunt room and face in the street , to the courtyard of the jester , which be hide from the sun . 
i love you more than ever and i have n't yet begin . 
you breathe on me and make me life a rich one to live . 
when i be deep in poverty , you teach me how to give , dry the tear up from me dream , and pull me from the hole . 
i love you more than ever and it burn me to the soul . 
you give me baby , one , two , three . 
what be more ? 
you save me life . 
eye for eye and tooth for tooth , you love cut like a knife . 
me thought of you do n't ever rest . 
they 'd kill me if i lie . 
but i 'd sacrifice the world for you to watch me sense die . 
the tune this be you and me to play upon this earth , we 'll play it out the well we know , whatever it be worth . 
what 's lose be lose . 
we ca n't regain what wend down in the flood , but happiness to me be you and i love you more than blood . 
it 's never be me duty to remake the world at large nor be it me intention to sound a battle charge because i love you more than all of this with a love this do n't bend and , if there be eternity , i 'll love you there again . 
oh , ca n't you see this you be bear to stand by me side and i be bear to be with you , you be bear to be me bride ? 
you 're the other half of what i be . 
you 're the miss piece and i love you more than ever with this love this do n't cease . 
you turn the tide on me each day and teach me eye to see . 
just be next to you be a natural thing for me and i can never let you go , no matter what go on because i love you more than ever now this the past be go .

they lower he down as a king . 
but , when the shadowy sun set on the one this fire the gun , he 'll see by he grave on the stone this remain , carve next to he name he epitaph plain , "only a pawn in they game .

" # when the ship come in oh , the time will come up when the wind will stop and the breeze will cease to be breathe , like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begin , the hour this the ship come in . 
and the sea will split and the ship will hit and the sand on the shoreline will be shake . 
and the tide will sound and the wave will pound and the morning will be break . 
the fish will laugh as they swim out of the path and the seagull , they 'll be smile . 
and the rock on the sand will proudly stand , the hour this the ship come in . 
and the word this be use for to get the ship confuse will not be understand as they 're speak for the chain of the sea will have bust in the night and be bury on the bottom of the ocean . 
a song will lift as the mainsail shift and the boat drift onto the shoreline . 
and the sun will respect every face on the deck , the hour this the ship come in . 
and the sand will roll out a carpet of gold for you weary toe to be touch . 
and the ship 's wise man will remind you once again this the whole , wide world be watch . 
oh , the foe will rise with the sleep still in they eye and they 'll jerk from they bed and think they 're dream , but they 'll pinch they and squeal and they 'll know this it 's for real , the hour when the ship come in . 
and they 'll raise they hand , say , "we 'll meet all you demand . 
" but we 'll shout from the bow , "your day be number . 
" and like pharaoh 's tribe they 'll be drownded in the tide and like goliath they 'll be conquer .
