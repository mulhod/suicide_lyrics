and me winter give way to warm as i 'm sing he to sleep. he go along just as a water lily , gentle on the surface of he thought he body float unweighed down by passion or intensity , yet unaware of the depth upon which he coast . 
and he find a home in me for what misfortune sow he know me touch will reap . 
and all me armour fall down in a pile at me foot . 
and me winter give way to warm as i 'm sing he to sleep. all me armour fall down in a pile at me foot .

all the advice i shun , and i run where they tell me not to run , but i sure have fun , so i 'm go to fuck it up again . 
i 'm go to do another detour . 
unpave me path . 
and if you want to make sense , what you look at me for ?

and i 'll be you girl , if you say it 's a gift . 
and you give me some more of you drug . 
yeah , i 'll be you pet , if you just tell me it 's a gift . 
because i 'm tire of whys , choke on whys . 
just need a little because , because ... i let the beast in , and then i even try forgive he , but it 's too soon . 
so i 'll fight again , again , again , again , again . 
and for a little while more , i 'll soar the uneven wind , complain and blame the sterile land . 
but if you 're get any bright idea , quiet dear i 'm bloom within . 
fast as you can , baby , wait , watch me , i 'll be out fast as i can , maybe late but at less about . 
fast as you can leave me , let this thing run it route , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can .

it 'd roll right past me . 
and if you chalk it up you 'll see i do n't really have a choice so do n't even ask me . 
i 'm much well off the way thing be . 
much , much well off , well by far . 
so keep on call me name , keep on , keep on , and i 'll keep kick the crap till it 's go .

nothing to figure out . 
i get to get he out . 
it 's time the truth be out this he do n't give a shit about me .

#i know so be it . 
i 'm you crowbar if this 's what i be so far , until you get out of this mess . 
and i will pretend this i dont know of you sin until you be ready to confess . 
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know . 
and you can use me skin to bury secret in , and i will settle you down . 
and at me own suggestion , i will ask no question while i do me thing in the background .

so for the time be , i 'm be patient . 
and amidst this bitterness , if you 'll just consider this , even if it do n't make sense all the time , give it time . 
and when the crowd become you burden , and you 've early close you curtain , i 'll wait by the backstage door while you try to find the line to speak you mind and pry it open , hope for an encore . 
and if it get too late , for me to wait for you to find you love me and tell me so , it 's okay , dont need to say it .
