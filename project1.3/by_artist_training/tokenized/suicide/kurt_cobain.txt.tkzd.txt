blew

if you would n't mind , i would like to blew .
if you would n't mind , i would like to lose .
if you would n't care , i would like to leave .
if you would n't mind , i would like to breathe .
is there another reason for your stain ?
could you believe who we knew was stress or strain ?
here is another word that rhymes with shame .

#floyd the barber

bell on door clanks .
come on in .
floyd observes my hairy chin .
sit down in the chair .
do n't be afraid .
steamed hot towel on my face .
i 'm ashamed .
i 'm ashamed .
i 'm ashamed .
barney ties me to the chair .
i ca n't see .
i 'm really scared .
floyd breathes hard .
i hear a zip .
pee-pee pressed against my lips .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
i sense others in the room .
opie aunt bee , i presume .
they take turns and cut me up .
i die smothered in andy 's clutch .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .

#love buzz

would you believe me when i tell you you are the queen of my heart ?
please do n't deceive me when i hurt you .
just be not the way it seems .

#paper cuts

when i 'm feeling tired , she pushed food through the door and i crawl towards the crack of light .
sometimes i ca n't find my way .
newspapers spread around , soaking all that they can .
a cleaning is due again , a good hosing down .
the lady whom i feel maternal love for cannot look me in the eyes , but i see hers and they are blue and they cock and twitch and masturbate !
i said so .
i said so .
i said so .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
black windows of paint i scratched with my nails .
i see others just like me .
why do they not try to escape ?
they bring out the older ones .
they point in my way .
they come with a flash of light and take my family away .
and very later i have learned to accept some friends of ridicule .
my whole existence is for your amusement and that is why i 'm here with you , to take me with .
you 're right .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .

#swap meet

they lead a lifetime that is comfortable .
they travel far to keep their stomachs full .
they make their living off of arts and crafts , the kind with seashells , driftwood , and burlap .
they make a deal when they come to town .
the sunday swap meet is a battleground .
she loves him more than he will ever know .
he loves her more than he will ever show .
keeps his cigarettes close to his heart .
keeps her photographs close to her heart .
keeps the bitterness close to the heart .

#serve the servants

teenage angst has paid off well .
now i 'm bored and old .
self-appointed judges judge more than they have sold .
if she floats , then she is not a witch like we had thought .
a down payment on another one at salem 's lot .
serve the servants , oh , no .
serve the servants , oh , no .
serve the servants , oh , no .
serve the servants , oh , no .
that legendary divorce is such a bore .
as my bones grew they did hurt .
they hurt really bad .
i tried hard to have a father , but instead i had a dad .
i just want you to know that i do n't hate you anymore .
there is nothing i could say that i have n't thought before .
serve the servants , oh , no .

#scentless apprentice

like most babies smell like butter , his smell smelled like no other .
he was born scentless and senseless .
he was born a scentless apprentice .
go away .
get away .
get away .
every wet nurse refused to feed him .
electrolytes smell like semen .
i promise not to sell your perfumed secrets .
there are countless formulas for pressing flowers .
go away .
get away .
get away .
i lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms .
leaking-out gas fumes are made into perfume .
you ca n't fire me because i quit !
throw me in the fire and i wo n't throw a fit .
go away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
get away .

#frances farmer will have her revenge on seattle

it 's so relieving to know that you 're leaving as soon as you get paid .
it 's so relaxing to hear that you 're asking wherever you get your way .
it 's so soothing to know that you 'll sue me .
this is starting to sound the same .
i miss the comfort in being sad .
i miss the comfort in being sad .
i miss the comfort in being sad .
in her false witness , we hope you 're still with us to see if they float or drown .
our favorite patient , a display of patience , disease-covered puget sound .
she 'll come back as fire to burn all the liars and leave a blanket of ash on the ground .
i miss the comfort in being sad .
i miss the comfort in being sad .

i 'm not like them , but i can pretend .
the sun is gone , but i have a light .

i think i 'm dumb or maybe just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy .
my heart is broke , but i have some glue .
help me inhale and mend it with you .
we 'll float around and hang out on clouds .
then we 'll come down and have a hangover , have a hangover , have a hangover , have a hangover .
skin the sun .
fall asleep.
wish away .
the soul is cheap .
lesson learned .
wish me luck .
soothe the burn .
wake me up .

#gallons of rubbing alcohol flow through the strip

it hurts when you have to press that dull little thing that you 're only supposed to use once and then discard .
where do you put it ?
in the garbage can , my honest friend .
my shyness , pet her flow .
she 's only been five months late even though we have n't had sex for a week .
a meal a day , a meal , i say , and my heart 's made my .
somebody else already used the word aurora borealis .
she was tied up in chains and sam had helped her in the freezer .
she 's only five weeks late , but i have n't had a date forever , ever , ever , forever !
wish i had more , more opportunity , more chances to remember some things , so i could n't have so much pressure on my , on my , on my , um , ah , on my , um , um , head .
we 'd have so much more diversity and so much more input , so much more creative flow if we had someone in school , a git .
git , geeks in town .
ha !
come on , dave , think of one !
girls with trouble .
it should be gic .
geeks with charvels .
no , gwc .
fuck , man , this is a waste of time .
one more solo ?
yeah !
yeah !
you 're personally responsible for the entire strip to be washed away , cleansed , as if gallons of , um , rubbing alcohol flowed through the strip and were set on fire .
it did n't just singe the hair , it made it straight .
and then perry ellis came along with his broom and his silk and he , he erected a beautiful city , a city of stars .

#smells like teen spirit

load up on guns and bring your friends .
it 's fun to lose and to pretend .

hello , hello , hello , how low ?

when i was an alien , cultures were n't opinions .
got to find a way , to find a way when i 'm here .
got to find a way , a better way .
i had better wait .
never met a wise man .
if so it 's a woman .
got to find a way , to find a way when i 'm here .

i had better wait .

#drain you

one baby to another says , i 'm lucky to have met you .
i do n't care what you think unless it is about me .
it is now my duty to completely drain you , a travel through a tube , and end up in your infection .
chew your meat for you .
pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours .
i like you .
with eyes so dilated , i 've become your pupil .
you 've taught me everything without a poison apple .
the water is so yellow .
i 'm a healthy student , indebted and so grateful .
vacuum out the fluids .
chew your meat for you .
pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours .
i like you , you , you , you , you , you .

i 'll wear a shield .
i 'll go out of my way to prove i still , i still smell her on you .

#turnaround

take a step outside yourself and you turn around .
take a look at who you are .
it 's pretty scary , so silly .
it 's revolting .
you 're not much .
you ca n't do anything .
take a step outside the city and you turn around .
take a look at what you are .
it is revolting .
you 're really nowhere , so wasteful , so foolish , poppycock !
who said do n't look back ?
do n't believe them .
go for that crazy sounding restaurant because they 're going to try and get behind you .
do n't you let them do it .
you know what i 'm talking about ?
you hear me talking ?
you hear me talking ?
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
take a step outside the country and you turn around .
take a look at what you are .
it is amazing .
take a good look .
you 're no big deal .
you 're so petty .
it 's a laugh .
take a step outside the planet .
turn around and around .
take a look at where you are .
it 's pretty scary .

why does n't she need him for a father ?
not only maidens can occupy my shack .
goring my manhood turns a man off .
like pepe lepew would say , hey , hey , hey ! and then we clash !
i got my diddly spayed .
i got my diddly spayed .
i got my diddly spayed .
i got my diddly .
she laughs about it , shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right , jacking themselves off polyester .
i want to jump .
this is n't right !
hey , when am i getting it back ?
i got my diddly spayed .
i got my diddly spayed .

i got my diddly spayed .
i got my diddly spayed .
i got my diddly spayed .

if you 're wondering , it 's gaining monthly .
fiberglass insulated , the sky is cotton candy .
spawning downstream , el rancho ovulate .
feeling ca n't help me romp .
bill , just fuck me .
take me anal .
billy 's slit reminds me of someone .
i 'm sick of paying for the love boat .
tony and tenille say , want to jump rope ?
and i say look !
i got my penis spayed .
i got a little tail .
i got my dingaling spayed .
i got my dingaling spayed .
i got to be around pussy .

#mexican seafood

all the itchy flakes it is aflaming , all the gels and creams it is pertaining to , a fungus mold cured by injection .
hope it 's only a yeast infection .
oh , well , it burns when i , it hurts when i pee .
oh , well , it hurts when i , it hurts when i see .
now i vomit cum and diarrhoea on the tile floor like oatmeal pizza , fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy puss .
i feel the blood becoming chowder rust .
oh , well , it burns when i , it hurts when i pee .
oh , well , it hurts when i , it hurts when i see .
roll into my bed , which does consist of lice , bugs and fleas and yellow mucus , stained dirt , vaseline , toe-jam and booger , stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge .

what 's a season in a right if you ca n't have anything ?
what 's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything ?
what 's the meaning in a crime ?
it 's a fan if anything .
where 's the learning in a line ?
it 's a brand .
it 's a brand .
how a culture comes again .
it was all here yesterday and you swear it 's not a trend .
does n't matter anyway .
there 's only here to talk to friends .
nothing new is every day .
you could shit upon the stage .
they 'll be fans .
they 'll be fans .
they 'll be fans .
they 'll be fans .
all the kids will eat it up if it 's packaged properly .
steal a sound and imitate .
keep a format equally , not an ode , just the facts , where our world is nowadays .
an idea is what we lack .
it does n't matter anyways .
all the kids will eat it up if it 's packaged properly .

keep a format equally , not an ode , just the facts , where our world is nowadays .

hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey .


#big long now

it 's not cold enough .
please put this side up .
she is moving through .
can we show our faces now ?
i 'm not interesting .
she 's not turning green , shameful as it seems .
can we show our faces now ?
endless climb .
i am blind .
why ca n't i leave ?
color-blind .
speaking a phrase .
instantly grown .
i am blind , waiting in line .
it 's not cold enough .
please put this side up .
she is moving through .
can we show our faces now ?
i 'm not interesting .
she 's not turning green , shameful as it seems .
can we show our faces now ?
endless climb .
i am blind .
why ca n't i leave ?
color-blind .
speaking a phrase .
instantly grown .
i am blind .
why am i sure ?
