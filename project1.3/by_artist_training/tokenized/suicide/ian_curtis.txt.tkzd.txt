atrocity exhibition

asylums with doors open wide where people had paid to see inside .
for entertainment they watch his body twist .
behind his eyes he says , 'i still exist . '
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
in arenas he kills for a prize , wins a minute to add to his life , but the sickness is drowned by cries for more .
pray to god .
make it quick .
watch him fall .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
this is the way .
this is the way .
this is the way .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
you 'll see the horrors of a faraway place , meet the architects of law face to face , see mass murder on a scale you 've never seen , and all the ones who try hard to succeed .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
this is the way .
step inside .
and i picked on the whims of a thousand or more , still pursuing the path that 's been buried for years , all the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire , ca n't replace or relate , ca n't release or repair .
take my hand and i 'll show you what was and will be .


#isolation

in fear every day , every evening , he calls her aloud from above , carefully watched for a reason , painstaking devotion and love , surrendered to self-preservation from others who care for themselves , a blindness that touches perfection , , but hurts just like anything else .
isolation , isolation , isolation .
mother , i tried .
please believe me .
i 'm doing the best that i can .
i 'm ashamed of the things i 've been put through .
i 'm ashamed of the person i am .
isolation , isolation , isolation .
but if you could just see the beauty , these things i could never describe , these pleasures a wayward distraction .
this is my one lucky prize .
isolation , isolation , isolation .


#passover

this is a crisis i knew had to come , destroying the balance i 'd kept , doubting , unsettling , and turning around , wondering what will come next .
is this the role that you wanted to live ?
i was foolish to ask for so much .
without the protection and infancy 's guard , it all falls apart at first touch .
watching the reel as it comes to a close , brutally taking its time .
people who change for no reason at all .
it 's happening all of the time .
can i go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind ?
back out of my duties when all 's said and done .
i know that i 'll lose every time .
moving along in our god-given ways .
safety is sat by the fire , sanctuary from these feverish smiles .
left with a mark on the door .
is this the gift that i wanted to give ?
"forgive and forget " 's what they teach .
or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach .
this is the crisis i knew had to come , destroying the balance i 'd kept , turning around to the next set of lives , wondering what will come next .


#colony

a cry for help .
a hint of anaesthesia .
the sound from broken homes .
we used to always meet here .
as he lays asleep , she takes him in her arms .
some things i have to do , but i do n't mean you harm .
a worried parent 's glance .
a kiss .
a last goodbye .
hands him the bag she packed .
the tears she tries to hide .
a cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy and leaves him standing cold here in this colony .
i ca n't see why all these confrontations .
i ca n't see why all these dislocations .
no family life .
this makes me feel uneasy .
stood alone here in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony .
dear , god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand .
god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand .
god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand .
god in his wisdom took you by the hand .
god in his wisdom made you understand in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony .


# a means to an end

a legacy so far removed one day will be improved .
eternal rights we left behind .
we were the better kind .
two the same .
set free , too .
i always looked to you .
i always looked to you .
i always looked to you .
we fought for good , stood side by side , our friendship never died .
on stranger waves , the lows and highs , our vision touched the sky .
immortalists with points to prove .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
a house somewhere on foreign soil , where ageless lovers call .
is this your goal , your final needs , where dogs and vultures eat ?
committed still , i turn to go .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you .
i put my trust in you , in you , in you , in you .
put my trust in you , in you .


#heart and soul

instincts that can still betray us .
a journey that leads to the sun .
soulless and bent on destruction .
a struggle between right and wrong .
you take my place in the showdown .
i 'll observe with a pitiful eye .
i 'd humbly ask for forgiveness , a request well beyond you and i .
heart and soul , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn .
an abyss that laughs at creation .
a circus complete with all fools .
foundations that lasted the ages , then ripped apart at their roots .
beyond all this good is the terror , the grip of a mercenary hand , when savagery turns all good reason .
there 's no turning back , no last stand .
heart and soul , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn .
existence .
well , what does it matter ?
i exist on the best terms i can .
the past is now part of my future .
the present is well out of hand .
the present is well out of hand .
heart and soul , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn , one will burn , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn .


#twenty four hours

so this is permanence , love 's shattered pride , what once was innocence turned on its side .
a cloud hangs over me , marks every move , deep in the memory of what once was love .
oh , how i realized !
how i wanted time !
put into perspective .
tried so hard to find .
just for one moment , thought i 'd found my way .
destiny unfolded .
i watched it slip away .
excessive flashpoints , beyond all reach .
solitary demands for all i 'd like to keep.
let 's take a ride out .
see what we can find .
a valueless collection of hopes and past desires .
i never realized the lengths i 'd have to go , all the darkest corners of a sense i did n't know .
just for one moment , i heard somebody call .
looked beyond the day in hand .
there 's nothing there at all .
now that i 've realized how it 's all gone wrong , got to find some therapy .
this treatment takes too long .
deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway , got to find my destiny before it gets too late .


# the eternal

procession moves on .
the shouting is over .
praise to the glory of loved ones now gone .
talking aloud as they sit around their tables , scattering flowers washed down by the rain .
stood by the gate at the foot of the garden , watching them pass like clouds in the sky .
try to cry out in the heat of the moment , possessed by a fury that burns from inside .
cry like a child , though these years make me older .
with children my time is so wastefully spent , a burden to keep , though their inner communion .
accept like a curse , an unlucky deal .
played by the gate at the foot of the garden .
my view stretches out from the fence to the wall .
no words could explain .
no actions determine .
just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall .


#decades

here are the young men , the weight on their shoulders .
here are the young men .
well , where have they been ?
we knocked on the doors of hell 's darker chamber .
pushed to the limit , we dragged ourselves in .
watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying .
we saw ourselves now as we never had seen .
portrayal of the trauma and degeneration , the sorrows we suffered and never were free .
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
weary inside , now our heart 's lost forever .
ca n't replace the fear or the thrill of the chase .
each ritual showed up .
the door for our wanderings open , then shut , then slammed in our face .
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?
where have they been ?

#transmission

radio , live transmission .
radio , live transmission .
listen to the silence .
let it ring on .
eyes , dark grey lenses frightened of the sun .
we would have a fine time living in the night , left to blind destruction , waiting for our sight .
and we would go on as though nothing was wrong and hide from these days .
we remained all alone , staying in the same place , just staying out the time , touching from a distance , further all the time .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
well , i could call out when the going gets tough .
the things that we 've learnt are no longer enough .
no language , just sound , that 's all we need know to synchronise love to the beat of the show .
and we could dance .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .
dance , dance , dance , dance , dance to the radio .


#atmosphere

walk in silence .
do n't walk away in silence .
see the danger , always danger .
endless talking .
life rebuilding .
do n't walk away .
walk in silence .
do n't turn away in silence .
your confusion , my illusion , worn like a mask of self-hate , confronts and then dies .
do n't walk away .
people like you find it easy , naked to see .
walking on air .
hunting by the rivers , through the streets .
every corner abandoned too soon , set down with due care .
do n't walk away in silence .
do n't walk away .


#something must break

someone take these dreams away that point me to another day , a duel of personalities that stretch all true realities , that keep calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me .
where figures from the past stand tall and mocking voices ring the halls , imperialistic house of prayer , conquistadors who took their share that keep calling me , they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me .
they keep calling me .
calling me , calling me , calling me , calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me .
they keep calling me .


#komakino

this is the hour when the mysteries emerge , a strangeness so hard to reflect , a moment so moving , goes straight to your heart .
the vision has never been met .
the attraction is held like a weight deep inside , something i 'll never forget .
the pattern is set .
her reaction will start , complete but rejected too soon .
looking ahead in the grip of each fear recalls the life that we knew .
the shadow that stood by the side of the road always reminds me of you .
how can i find the right way to control all the conflicts inside , all the problems beside as the questions arise and the answers do n't fit into my way of things , into my way of things ?


#love will tear us apart

when routine bites hard and ambitions are low and resentment rides high , but emotions wo n't grow and we 're changing our ways , taking different roads , love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
why is the bedroom so cold ?
turned away on your side .
is my timing that flawed ?
our respect run so dry ?
yet there 's still this appeal that we 've kept through our lives .
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
do you cry out in your sleep ?
all my failings exposed .
gets a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold .
why is it something so good just ca n't function no more ?
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear up apart again .


#warsaw

i was there in the backstage when the first light came around .
i grew up like a changeling to win the first time around .
i can see all the weakness .
i pick all the faults .
well , i concede all the faith tests just to stick in your throats .
31g , 31g , 31g .
i hung around in your soundtrack to mirror all that you 've done , to find the right side of reason , to kill the three lies for one .
i can see all the cold facts .
i can see through your eyes .
all this talk made no contact no matter how hard we tried .
31g , 31g , 31g .
i can still hear the footsteps .
i can see only walls .
i slid into your man-traps with no hearing at all .
i just see contradiction , had to give up the fight just to live in the past tense , to make believe you were right .
31g , 31g , 31g .


#leaders of men

born from some mother 's womb , just like any other room .
made a promise for a new life .
made a victim out of your life .
when your time 's on the door and it drips to the floor and you feel you can touch ,
all the noise is too much and the seeds that are sown are no longer your own .
just a minor operation to force a final ultimatum .
thousand words are spoken loud reach the dumb to fool the crowd .
when you walk down the street and the sound 's not so sweet and you wish you could hide ,
maybe go for a ride to some peep-show arcade , where the future 's not made .
a nightmare situation infiltrates imagination , smacks of past holy wars by the wall with broken laws .
the leaders of men , born out of your frustration .
the leaders of men , just a strange infatuation .
the leaders of men made a promise for a new life , no saviour for our sakes to twist the internees of hate , self-induced manipulation to crush all thoughts of mass salvation .


#digital

feel it closing in , feel it closing in , the fear of whom i call .
every time i call i feel it closing in .
i feel it closing in day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out .
i feel it closing in as patterns seem to form .
i feel it cold and warm .
the shadows start to fall .
i feel it closing in .
i feel it closing in day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out .
i 'd have the world around to see just whatever happens , stood by the door alone , and then it 's fade away .
i see you fade away .
do n't ever fade away .
i need you here today .
do n't ever fade away .
do n't ever fade away .
do n't ever fade away .
do n't ever fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away .


#autosuggestion

here , here , everything is by design .
everything is by design .
here , here , everything is kept inside , so take a chance and step outside .
your hopes , your dreams , your paradise .
heroes , idols cracked like ice .
here , here , everything is kept inside .
so take a chance and step outside .
pure frustration face to face .
a point of view creates more waves ,
so take a chance and step outside .
take a chance and step outside .
lose some sleep and say you tried .
meet frustration face to face .
a point of view creates more waves .
so lose some sleep and say you tried .
so lose some sleep and say you tried .
so lose some sleep and say you tried .
so lose some sleep and say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
say you tried .
yeah , lose some sleep and say you tried .
yeah , lose some sleep and say you tried .
yeah , lose some sleep and say you tried .
yeah , lose some sleep and say you tried .


# no love lost

so long sitting her .
did n't hear the warning .
waiting for the tape to run .
we 've been moving around in different situations , knowing that the time would come , just to see you torn apart , witness to your empty heart .
i need it .
i need it .
i need it .
through the wire screen , the eyes of those standing outside looked in at her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo .
in the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument which they had that morning inserted deep into her body .
she shuddered instinctively .
no life at all in the house of dolls .
no love lost .
no love lost .
you 've been seeing things in darkness , not in learning , hoping that the truth will pass .
no life underground .
wasting .
never changing .
wishing that this day wo n't last .
to never see you show your age , to watch until the beauty fades , i need it .
i need it .
i need it .


#failures

do n't speak of safe messiahs , a failure of the modern man .
to the centre of all life 's desires .
as a whole , not an also-ran .
love in a hollow field .
break the image of your father 's son .
drawn to an inner feel , he was thought of as the only one .
he was thought of as the only one .
he no longer denies all the failures of the modern man .
no , no , no , he ca n't pick sides .
sees the failures of the modern man .
wise words and sympathy tell the story of our history .
new strength gives a real touch .
sense and reason make it all too much .
with a strange fatality , broke the spirits of a lesser man some other race can see .
in his way he was the only one .
in his way he was the only one .
he no longer denies all the failures of the modern man .
no , no , no , he ca n't pick sides .
sees the failures of the modern man , now that it 's time to decide .
in his time he was a total man , taken from caesar 's side , kept in silence just to prove who 's wrong .
he no longer denies all the failures of the modern man .
no , no , no , he ca n't pick sides .
sees the failures of the modern man , all the failures of the modern man .


#from safety to where ... ?

no , i do n't know just why .
no , i do n't know just why , which way to turn .
i 've got this ticket to use .
through childlike ways rebellion and crime to reach this point and retreat back again .
the broken hearts , all the wheels that have turned , the memories scarred and the vision is blurred .
no , i do n't know just why , do n't know which way to turn , the best possible use .
just passing through till we reach the next stage .
but just to where , well , it 's all been arranged .
just passing through , but the break must be made .
should we move on or stay safely away ?
through childlike ways rebellion and crime to reach this point and retreat back again .
the broken hearts , all the wheels that have turned , the memories scarred and the vision is blurred .
just passing through till we reach the next stage .
but just to where , well , it 's all been arranged .
just passing through , but the break must been made .
should we move on or stay safely away ?


#novelty

when people listen to you , do n't you know it means a lot because you 've got to work so hard for everything you 've got .
ca n't rest on your laurels now , not when you 've got none .
you 'll find yourself in a gutter , right back where you came from .
someone told me being in the know is the main thing .
we all need the security that belonging brings .
ca n't stand on your own in these times , against all the odds .
you all just fall behind like all the other sods .
you slap our backs and pretend you knew about all the things that we were going to do .
what you going to do ?
what you going to do when it 's over ?
you 're on your own now .
do n't you think that 's a shame ?
but you 're the only one responsible to take the blame .
so what you going to do when the novelty has gone ?
yeah , what you going to do when the novelty has gone ?
you slap our backs and pretend you knew about all the things we were going to do .
what you going to do ?
what you going to do when it 's over ?


#these days

morning seems strange , almost out of place .
searched hard for you and your special ways .
these days , these days .
spent all my time .
learnt a killer 's art .
took threats and abuse till i 'd learned the part .
can you stay for these days ?
these days , these days .
used outward deception to get away , broken heart romance to make it pay .
these days , these days .
we 'll drift through it all .
it 's the modern age .
take care of it all now these debts are paid .
can you stay for these days ?

#exercise one

when you 're looking at life in a strange new room , maybe drowning soon , is this the start of it all ?
turn on your tv.
turn down your pulse .
turn away from it all .
it 's all getting too much .
when you 're looking at life , deciphering scars .
just who fooled who ?
sit still in their cars .
the lights look bright when you reach outside , time for one last ride before the end of it all .


#ice age

i 've seen the real atrocities , buried in the sand , stockpiled for safety while we stand holding hands .
i 'm living in the ice age .
i 'm living in the ice age .
nothing will hold .
nothing will fit into the cold .
it 's not an eclipse .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
searching for another way , hide behind the door .
we 'll live in holes and disused shafts , hopes for little more .
i 'm living in the ice age .
i 'm living in the ice age .
nothing will hold .
nothing will fit into the cold .
no smile on your lips .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .
living in the ice age .


# the sound of music

see my true reflection .
cut off my own connections .
i can see life getting harder .
so sad is this sensation .
reverse the situation .
i ca n't see it getting better .
i 'll walk you through the heartbreak , show you all the outtakes .
i ca n't see it getting higher , systematically degraded , emotionally a scapegoat .
i ca n't see it getting better .
perverse and unrealistic .
try to make it all sick .
i ca n't see it getting better .
hollow now , i 'm burned out .
all i need to break out .
i ca n't see life getting higher .
love of life makes you feel higher .
love of life makes you feel higher , higher , higher , higher , higher , , higher , higher , higher , higher .
love of life makes you feel higher .


#glass

hearts fail .
young hearts fail anytime pressurized , overheat , overtired .
take it quick .
take it neat .
clasp your hands .
touch your feet .
take it quick .
take it neat .
hearts fail .
young hearts fail anytime wearing down , on the run , underground .
put your hand where it 's safe .
leave your hand where it 's safe .
do it again .
do it again and again and again .
anytime , that 's your right .
told you we should do it again .
overheat , overtired .
do n't you wish to do it again ?
anytime , that 's all right .
do n't you wish to do it again ?
i bet you wish you do it again , do it again .


# the only mistake

made the fatal mistake , like i did once before , a tendency just to take till the purpose turned sour .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
yeah , the only mistake was that you ran away , avenues lined with trees , strangled words for the day .
yeah , the only mistake , like i made once before .
yeah , the only mistake .
could have made it before .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
strain .
take the strain .
these days we love .
and the only mistake led to rumours unfound , led to pressures unknown , different feelings and sounds .
yeah , the only mistake , like i made once before .
yeah , the only mistake .
could have made it before .


#walked in line

all dressed in uniforms so fine , they drank and killed to pass the time .
wearing the shame of all their crimes , with measured steps they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they carried pictures of their wives and numbered tags to prove their lives .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
full of a glory never seen , they made it through the whole machine to never question anymore .
hypnotic trance .
they never saw .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line , walked in line , walked in line .


# the kill

moved in a hired car and i find no way to run .
adds every moment longer .
had no time for fun .
just something that i knew i had to do .
but through it all i left my eyes on you .
i had an impulse to clear it all away .
oh , i used the tactics .
make everybody pay .
just something that i knew i had to do .
but through it all i kept my eyes on you .
oh , i keep it all clean .
i 've paid the graces there .
no kings of misuse .
no sellers of flesh .
just something that i knew i had to do .
but through it all i kept my eyes on you .
yeah , through it all i kept my eyes on you .
but through it all i kept my eyes on you .

#disorder

i 've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand .
could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man ?
these sensations barely interest me for another day .
i 've got the spirit .
lose the feeling .
take the shock away .
it 's getting faster , moving faster now .
it 's getting out of hand .
on the tenth floor , down the back stairs , it 's a no man 's land .
lights are flashing .
cars are crashing , getting frequent now .
i 've got the spirit .
lose the feeling .
let it out somehow .
what means to you .
what means to me .
and we will meet again .
i 'm watching you .
i 'm watching her .
i 'll take no pity from you friends .
who is right ?
who can tell ?
and who gives a damn right now ?
until the spirit new sensation takes hold , then you know .
until the spirit new sensation takes hold , then you know .
until the spirit new sensation takes hold , then you know .
i 've got the spirit , but lose the feeling .
i 've got the spirit , but lose the feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling , feeling .


#day of the lords

this is the room , the start of it all , no portrait so fine , only sheets on the wall .
i 've seen the nights filled with blood-sport and pain and the bodies obtained , the bodies obtained .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
these are your friends from childhood , through youth , who goaded you on , demanded more proof .
withdrawal pain is hard .
it can do you right in , so distorted and thin , distorted and thin .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
this is the car at the edge of the road .
there 's nothing disturbed .
all the windows are closed .
i guess you were right when we talked in the heat .
there 's no room for the weak , no room for the weak .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
this is the room , the start of it all .
through childhood , thrugh youth , i remember it all .
oh , i 've seen the nights filled with blood-sport and pain and the bodies obtained , the bodies obtained , the bodies obtained .
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?
where will it end ?


#candidate

forced by the pressure , the territories marked .
no longer the pleasure .
oh , i 've since lost the heart .
corrupted from memory , no longer the power .
it 's creeping up slowly , that last fatal hour .
oh , i do n't know what made me .
what gave me the right to mess with your values and change wrong to right ?
please keep your distance .
the trail leads to here .
there 's blood on your fingers , brought on by fear .
i campaigned for nothing .
i worked hard for this .
i tried to get to you .
you treat me like this .
it 's just second nature .
it 's what we 've been shown .
we 're living by your rules .
that 's all that we know .
i tried to get to you .
i tried to get to you .
i tried to get to you .
i tried to get to you .


#insight

guess your dreams always end .
they do n't rise up , just descend .
but i do n't care anymore .
i 've lost the will to want more .
i 'm not afraid , not at all .
i watch them all as they fall , but i remember when we were young .
those with habits of waste , their sense of style and good taste , of making sure you were right .
hey , do n't you know you were right ?
i 'm not afraid anymore .
i keep my eyes on the door , but i remember .
tears of sadness for you , more upheaval for you reflects a moment in time , a special moment in time .
yeah , we wasted our time ,
we did n't really have time , but we remember when we were young .
and all god 's angels beware and all you judges beware .
sons of chance , take good care for all the people not there .
i 'm not afraid anymore .
i 'm not afraid anymore .
i 'm not afraid anymore .
oh , i 'm not afraid anymore .


#new dawn fades

a change of speed , a change of style , a change of scene with no regrets , a chance to watch , admire the distance still occupied though you forget .
different colors , different shades , over each mistakes were made .
i took the blame .
directionless , so plain to see , a loaded gun wo n't set you free , so you say .
we 'll share a drink and step outside , an angry voice and one who cried , "we 'll give you everything and more .
the straing . too much , ca n't take much more . "
oh , i 've walked on water , run through fire , ca n't seem to feel it anymore .
it was me , waiting for me , hoping for something more , me seeing me this time , hoping for something else .


#she 's lost control

confusion in her eyes that says it all .
she 's lost control .
and she 's clinging to the nearest passer-by .
she 's lost control .
and she gave away the secrets of her past and said i 've lost control again and of a voice that told her when and where to act .
she said i 've lost control again .
and she turned around and took me by the hand and said i 've lost control again .
and how i 'll never know just why or understand .
she said i 've lost control again .
and she screamed out , kicking on her side , and said i 've lost control again .
and seized up on the floor , i thought she 'd die .
she said i 've lost control .
she 's lost control again .
she 's lost control .
she 's lost control again .
she 's lost control .
well , i had to phone her friend to state my case and say she 's lost control again .
and she showed up all the errors and mistakes and said i 've lost control again .
but she expressed herself in many different ways until she lost control again and walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed .
i 've lost control .
she 's lost control again .
she 's lost control .
she 's lost control again .
she 's lost control .
i could live a little better with the myths and the lies .
when the darkness broke in , i just broke down and cried .
i could live a little in a wider line when the change is gone , when the urge is gone to lose control , when here we come .


#shadowplay

to the centre of the city where all roads meet waiting for you , to the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank searching for you , i was moving through the silence without motion , waiting for you .
in a room with a window in the corner i found truth .
in the shadow-play , acting out your own death , knowing no more , as the assassins all grouped in four lines , dancing on the floor , and with cold steel , odor on their bodies made a move to connect , but i could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left .
i did everything , everything i wanted to .
i let them use you for their own ends .
to the center of the city in the night waiting for you .
to the center of the city in the night waiting for you .


#wilderness

i travelled far and wide throguh many different times .
what did you see there ?
i saw the saints with their toys .
what did you see there ?
i saw all knowledge destroyed .
i travelled far and wide through many different times .
i travelled far and wide through prisons of the cross .
what did you see there ?
the power and glory of sin .
what did you see there ?
the blood of christ on their skins .
i travelled far and wide through many different times .
i travelled far and wide and unknown martyrs died .
what did you see there ?
i saw the one-sided trials .
what did you see there ?
i saw the tears as they cried .
they had tears in their eyes , tears in their eyes , tears in their eyes , tears in their eyes .


#interzone

i walked through the city limits .
someone talked me in to do it .
attracted by some force within it , fad to close my eyes to get close to it .
around a corner where a prophet lay , saw the place where she had a room to stay , a wire fence where the children played .
saw the bed where the body lay and i was looking for a friend of mine .
and i had no time to waste .
yeah , looking for some friends of mine .
the cars screeched .
hear the sound on dust .
heard a noise . just a car outside , metallic blue turned red with rust .
pulled in close by the building 's side in a group , all forgotten youth .
had to think , collect .
my senses now are turned onto a knife-edged view .
find some places where my friends do n't know .
and i was looking for a friend of mine .
and i had no time to waste .
yeah , looking for some friends of mine .
down the dark streets the houses looked the same .
getting darker now .
faces look the same .
and i walked around and around .
no stomach .
torn apart .
nail me to a train .
had to think again .
trying to find a clue .
trying to find a way to get out !
trying to move away .
had to move away and keep out .
four , twelve windows , ten in a row , behind a wall .
well , i looked down low .
the lights shined like a neon show .
inserted deep .
felt a warmer glow .
no place to stop .
no place to go .
no time to lose .
had to keep on going .
i guessed they died some time ago .
i guessed they died some time ago .
and i was looking for a friend of mine .
and i had no time to waste .
yeah , looking for some friends of mine .


#i remember nothing

we were strangers .
we were strangers for way too long , for way too long .
we were strangers for way too long .
violent , violent .
were strangers .
get weak all the time .
may just pass the time .
me in my own world and you there beside .
the gaps are enormous .
we stare from each side .
we were strangers for way too long .
violent , more violent , his hand cracks the chair , moves on reaction , then slumps in despair .
trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon .
me in my own world , the one that you knew for way too long .
we were strangers for way too long .
we were strangers .
we were strangers for way too long , for way too long .
