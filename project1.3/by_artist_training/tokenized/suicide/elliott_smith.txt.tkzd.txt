speed trials

he 's pleased to meet you underneath the horse in the cathedral with the glass stained black singing sweet high notes that echo back to destroy their master .
may be a long time till you get the call-up , but it 's sure as fate and hard as your luck .
no one 'll know where you are .
it 's just a brief smile crossing your face , running speed trials still standing in place when the socket 's not a shock enough .
you little child , what makes you think you 're tough when all the people you think you 're above , they all know what 's the matter ?
you 're such a pinball .
yeah , you know it 's true .
there 's always something you come back running to , to follow the path of no resistance .
it 's just a brief smile crossing your face , running speed trials standing in place .
it 's just a brief smile crossing your face , running speed trials all over the place .


#alameda

you walk down alameda shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone like some precious only son face down , bow to the champion .
you walk down alameda looking at the cracks in the sidewalk , thinking about your friends , how you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense for your own protection over their affection .
nobody broke your heart .
you broke your own because you ca n't finish what you start .
walk down alameda brushing off the nightmare you wish could plague me when i 'm awake and now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate .
for one or two minutes she liked you , but the fix is in .
you 're all pretension .
i never pay attention .
nobody broke your heart .
you broke your own because you ca n't finish what you start .
nobody broke your heart .
you broke your own because you ca n't finish what you start .
nobody broke your heart .
you broke your own because you ca n't finish what you start .
nobody broke your heart .
if you 're alone , it must be you that wants to be apart .


#ballad of big nothing

throwing candy out to the crowd dragging down the main , the helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who 's always got something to say .
you 're sitting at home now waiting for your brother to call .
i saw him down at the alley having had enough of it all .
said you can do what you want to whenever you want to .
you can do what you want to .
there 's no one to stop you .
all spit and spite , you 're up all night and down every day , a tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away , getting in to the back of a car for candy from some stranger , watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger .
you can do what you want to whenever you want to .
you can do what you want to .
there 's no one to stop you .
now you can do what you want to whenever you want to , do what you want to whenever you want to , do what you want to whenever you want to though it does n't mean a thing , big nothing .


#between the bars

drink up , baby , stay up all night .
the things you could do , you wo n't but you might .
the potential you 'll be that you 'll never see .
the promises you 'll only make .
drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days .
do what i say and i 'll make you okay and drive them away , the images stuck in your head .
people you 've been before that you do n't want around anymore that push and shove and wo n't bend to your will .
i 'll keep them still
drink up , baby , look at the stars .
i 'll kiss you again between the bars where i 'm seeing you there with your hands in the air waiting to finally be caught .
drink up one more time and i 'll make you mine , keep you apart deep in my heart separate from the rest where i like you the best and keep the things you forgot .
the people you 've been before that you do n't want around anymore that push and shove and wo n't bend to your will .
i 'll keep them still .


#pictures of me

start , stop and start .
stupid acting smart .
flirting with the flicks .
you say it 's just for kicks .
you 'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks .
you got yourself to tease and displease .
doors swinging wide , you walked in to hide .
looking at your feet , failure 's complete .
saw you and me on the coin-op tv frozen in fear every time we appear .
i 'm not surprised and , really , why should i be ?
see nothing wrong , see nothing wrong , so sick and tired of all these pictures of me .
completely wrong , totally wrong .
go walking by .
here comes another guy , jailer who sells personal hells who 'd like to see me down on my fucking knees .
everybody 's dying just to get the disease .
hey , hey , hey , hey , i 'm not surprised and , really , why should i be ?
see nothing wrong , see nothing wrong , so sick and tired of all these pictures of me .
completely wrong , totally wrong .
i 'm not surprised and , really , why should i be ?
see nothing wrong , see nothing wrong , so sick and tired of all these pictures of me .
oh , everybody 's dying just to get the disease .
everybody 's dying just to get the disease .
everybody 's dying just to get the disease .


# no name # 5

got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past and everybody 's gone at last .
a sweet , sweet smile that 's fading fast because everybody 's gone at last .
and you do n't get upset about it , no not anymore .
there 's nothing wrong that was n't wrong before .
had a second alone with a chance let pass and everybody 's gone at last .
well , i hope you 're not waiting , waiting around for me because i 'm not going anywhere , obviously .
got a broken heart and your name on my cast and everybody 's gone at last .
everybody 's gone at last .


#rose parade

they asked me to come down and watch the parade and to march down the street like the duracell bunny .
with a wink and a wave from the cavalcade , throwing out candy that looks like money to people passing by that all seem to be going the other way .
said wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?
tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar .
people were shouting and pushing and saying .
and when i traded a smoke for a food-stamp dollar , a ridiculous marching band started playing and got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song .
wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?
wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?
wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?
the trumpet has obviously been drinking because he 's fucking up even the simplest lines .
i 'd say it 's a sight that 's quite worth seeing .
it 's just that everyone 's interest is stronger than mine .
and , when they clean the street , i 'll be the only shit that 's left behind .
wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?
wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?
wo n't you follow me down to the rose parade ?


#punch and judy

a wallflower punch talks to judy in a crowded corner where anybody can listen in , but they do n't read page to page or speak easy .
now they 're going to go say the words in the wrong order again .
they walk in a circle through all the sidewalk scenes they used to be a part of one time .
now everybody just stares and whispers , driving around up and down division street .
i used to like it here .
it just bums me out to remember .
ca n't you ever treat anyone nice ?
i think i 'm going to make the same mistake twice .
they draw the curtain , wait for a call .
pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all .
ca n't you ever treat anyone nice ?
i think i 'm going to make the same mistake twice .
i 'm going to make the same mistake twice .


#angeles

someone 's always coming around here trailing some new kill .
says i seen your picture on a hundred-dollar bill .
and what 's a game of chance to you to him is one of real skill .
so glad to meet you , angeles .
picking up the ticket shows there 's money to be made .
go on and lose the gamble .
that 's the history of the trade .
you add up all the cards left to play to zero and sign up with evil .
angeles , do n't start me trying now because i 'm all over it , angeles .
i could make you satisfied in everything you do .
all your 'secret wishes ' could right now be coming true .
and be forever with my poison arms around you .
no one 's going to fool around with us .
no one 's going to fool around with us .
so glad to meet you , angeles .


#cupid 's trick

she 's shaking down .
i 'm absent and numb from shock , reaching around for the hands of the clock .
should 've lied .
lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up .
cupid 's trick comes down to shake and deal the stupid kick that makes me real .
should 've lied .
lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up .
she 's shaking down .
it 's never over and done .
so , kick me , cane me .
then i 'll know why .
lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up , it 's my lie .
should 've lit me up .


# 2:45 am

i 'm going out sleepwalking where mute memories start talking .
the boss that could n't help but hurt you and the pretty thing he made desert you .
i 'm going out now like a baby , a naive unsatisfiable baby , grabbing onto whatever 's around for the soaring high or the crushing down with hidden cracks that do n't show but that constantly just grow .
i 'm looking for the man that attacked me while everybody was laughing at me .
you beat it in me , that part of you , but i 'm going to split us back in two .
tired of living in a cloud .
if you 're going to say shit now , you 'll do it out loud ,
it 's 2:45 in the morning and i 'm putting myself on warning for waking up in an unknown place with a recollection you 've half erased , looking for somebody 's arms to wave away past harms .
i 'm walking out on center circle .
the both of you can just fade to black .
i 'm walking out on center circle , been pushed away and i 'll never go back .


#say yes

i 'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who 's still around the morning after .
we broke up a month ago and i grew up .
i did n't know i 'd be around the morning after .
it 's always been wait and see , a happy day and then you pay and feel like shit the morning after .
but now i feel changed around and instead of falling down
i 'm standing up the morning after .
situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later .
and i could be another fool or an exception to the rule .
you tell me the morning after .
crooked spin ca n't come to rest .
i 'm damaged bad at best .
she 'll decide what she wants .
i 'll probably be the last to know .
no one says until it shows and you see how it is .
they want you or they do n't .
say yes .
i 'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who 's still around the morning after .

#needle in the hay

your hand on his arm , the hay-stack charm around your neck , strung out and thin , calling some friend , trying to cash some check .
he 's acting dumb .
that 's what you 've come to expect .
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .
he 's wearing your clothes , head down to toes , a reaction to you .
you say you know what he did , but you idiot kid , you do n't have a clue .
sometimes they just get caught in the eye you 're pulling him through .
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .
now on the bus , nearly touching this dirty retreat , falling out , 6th and powell , a dead sweat in my teeth .
going to walk , walk , walk four more blocks plus the one in my brain , down downstairs to the man .
he 's going to make it all ok .
i ca n't beat myself , i ca n't beat myself and i do n't want to talk .
i 'm taking the cure , so i can be quiet whenever i want .
so leave me alone .
you ought to be proud that i 'm getting good marks .
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .


#christian brothers

no bad-dream fucker 's going to boss me around .
christian brothers going to take him down .
but it ca n't help me get over .
do n't be cross .
it 's sick what i want .
i 've seen the boss blink on and off .
fake concerns is what 's the matter , man .
and you think i ought to shake your motherfucking hand .
well , i know how much you care .
do n't be cross .
it 's sick what i want .
i 've seen the boss blink on and off .
come here by me .
i want you here .
nightmares become me .
it 's so fucking clear .
nightmares become me .
it 's so fucking clear .


#clementine

they 're waking you up to close the bar .
the street 's wet .
you can tell by the sound of the cars .
the bartender 's singing clementine while he 's turning around the open sign .
dreadful sorry , clementine .
though you 're still her man , it seems a long time gone .
maybe the whole thing 's wrong .
what if she thinks so , but just did n't say so ?
you drank yourself into slow-mo , made an angel in the snow .
anything to pass the time and keep that song out of your mind .
oh , my darling , oh , my darling , oh , my darling clementine .
dreadful sorry , clementine .


#southern belle

killing a southern belle is all you know how to do , that and give other people hell .
it 's what they expect from you too , but i would n't have you how you want .
i do n't want to walk around .
i do n't even want to breathe .
i live in a southern town where all you can do is grit your teeth , but i would n't have you how you want .
how come you 're not ashamed of what you are ?
and sorry that you 're the one she got ?
be not nobody talking now , nobody .
nothing 's said .
no one 's about to shout .
nobody 's seen red , but i would n't have you how you want .
you 're killing a southern belle , killing a southern belle , killing a southern belle .


#single file

here in line where stupid shit collides with dying shooting stars , all we got to show what we really are is the same kind of scars and , looking at you , all i see is you 're waiting for something single-file .
you 're a murder-mile .
you idiot kid , your arm 's got a death in it .
if you 're choking up , take this paper cup , but there 's a price you 'll pay for trying hard to become whatever they are and saying whatever they say .
so help yourself to this bitter pill or somebody else will .
single file .
you 're a murder-mile .
you idiot kid , your arm 's got a death in it .
single file , single file , single file , single file .


#coming up roses

i 'm a junkyard full of false starts and i do n't need your permission to bury my love under this bare lightbulb .
the moon is a sickle cell .
it 'll kill you in time .
you cold , white brother riding your blood like spun glass in sore eyes while the moon does its division .
you 're buried below and you 're coming up roses .
everywhere you go red roses follow .
the things that you tell yourself , they 'll kill you in time .
you cold white brother alive in your blood , spinning in the night sky while the moon does its division .
you 're buried below and you 're coming up roses .
everywhere you go red roses .
so you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows and you 're coming up roses .
everywhere you go red roses .


#satellite

while the hands are pointing up midnight , you 're a question mark coming after people you watched collide .
you can ask what you want to the satellite because the names you drop put ice in my veins .
and , for all you know , you 're the only one who finds it strange when they call it a lover 's moon , the satellite , because it acts just like lovers do .
the satellite , a burned out world you know staying up all night , the satellite .


#alphabet town

alphabet city is haunted .
constantina feels right at home .
she probably wo n't say you 're wrong , but you 're already wrong , you 're already wrong , and you threw up whatever she shot down , said show me around this alphabet town , said show me around .
there 's a name you keep repeating .
you got nothing better to do and you 're with someone who 'll hear you say it and just not mind .
her hand on your arm , her hand on your arm , she put her hand on your arm and told you her name .
you ca n't pronounce it .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
i know what you are .
i just do n't mind .
i wo n't say you 're wrong .
i know what you want and it 's what i want .
so let 's go out .
i 'm ready to go out .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .


#st . ides heaven

everything is exactly right when i walk around here drunk every night with an open container from 7-11 in st . ides heaven .
i 've been out haunting the neighborhood and everybody can see i 'm no good when i 'm walking out between parked cars with my head full of stars .
high on amphetamines , the moon is a lightbulb breaking .
it 'll go around with anyone , but it wo n't come down for anyone .
you think you know what brings me down , that i want those things you could never allow .
you see me smiling .
you think it 's a frown turned upside down because everyone is a fucking pro and they all got answers from trouble they 've known and they all got to say what you should and should n't do though they do n't have a clue .
high on amphetamines , the moon is a lightbulb breaking .
it 'll go around with anyone , but it wo n't come down for anyone and i wo n't come down for anyone .


# good to go

a low-riding junkie girl rode down south to your little world like a dream .
you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to be like me .
i would n't need a hero if i was n't such a zero , if i was n't such a zero .
good to go .
all i ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around .
it 's all i ever see around here .
she kicked new york like a curse and you traced her footsteps in reverse up to queens .
you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to be like me .
i would n't need a hero if i was n't such a zero , if i was n't such a zero .
good to go .
all i ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around .
it 's all i ever see around here , some empty envelopes from some other town .
it 's all i ever see around here , i 'm waiting for something that 's not coming .


# the white lady loves you more

keep your things in a place meant to hide , but i know they 're there somewhere and i know that 's where you 'll go tonight .
i 'll be thrown over just like before .
the white lady loves you more .
need a medal , man , just to pick up your feet .
it 's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreet .
i know what this medal is for .
the white lady loves you more .
i 'm looking at a hand full of broken plans and i 'm tired of playing it down .
you just want her to do anything to you .
there be not nothing that you wo n't allow .
you wake up in the middle of the night from a dream you wo n't remember , flashing on like a cop 's light .
you say she 's waiting and i know what for .
the white lady loves you more , the white lady .


# the biggest lie

i 'm waiting for the train , the subway that only goes one way , the stupid thing that will come to pull us apart and make everybody late .
you spent everything you had , wanted everything to stop that bad and now i 'm a crushed credit card registered to smith , not the name that you call me with .
you turned white like a saint .
i 'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold-flake paint .
oh , we 're so very precious , you and i , and everything that you do makes me want to die .
oh , i just told the biggest lie .
i just told the biggest lie , the biggest lie .

#son of sam

something 's happening .
do n't speak too soon .
i told the boss off and made my move .
got nowhere to go .
son of sam , son of the shining path , the clouded mind , the couple killer each and every time .
i 'm not uncomfortable , feeling weird , lonely , leered , options disappear , but i know what to do .
son of sam , son of a doctor 's touch , a nurse 's love , acting under orders from above .
king for a day , son of sam , son of the shining path , the clouded mind , the couple killer running out of time .
shiva opens her arms now to make sure i do n't get too far .
i may talk in my sleep tonight because i do n't know what i am .
i 'm a little like you , more like son of sam .


#somebody that i used to know

i had tender feelings that you made hard , but it 's your heart , not mine , that 's scarred .
so when i go home , i 'll be happy to go .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
you do n't need my help anymore .
it 's all now to you , there be not no before , now that you 're big enough to run your own show .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
i watched you deal in a dying day and throw the living past away , so you can be sure that you 're in control .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
i know you do n't think you did me wrong and i ca n't stay this way for long , keeping ahold of what you just let go .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .


# junk bond trader

the imitation picks you up like a habit , writing in the glow of the tv 's static , taking out the trash to the man .
give the people something they understand .
a stickman flashing a fine-line smile .
junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a style .
rich man in a poor man 's clothes .
the permanent installment of the daily dose .
and you tell off when you tell it like it is .
your world 's no wider than your hatred of his .
checking into a small reality , boring as a drug you take too regularly .
the athlete 's laugh .
the broken crutch .
the first true love that folded at the slightest touch , brought down like an old hotel .
people digging through rubble for things they can resell .
happy holidays , said sick savior , the leaving lover that i still favor .
i wo n't take your medicine .
i do n't need a remedy to be everything i 'm supposed to be .
i do n't want nobody else .
i can do it by myself .
we 're meant to be together .
now i 'm a policeman directing traffic , keeping everything moving , everything static .
i 'm the hitchhiker you 'll recognize passing on your way to some everlasting .
better sell it while you can .
better sell it while you can .
better sell it while you can .
better sell it while you can .


#everything reminds me of her

i never really had a problem because of leaving , but everything reminds me of her this evening .
so , if i seem a little out of it , sorry , but why should i lie ?
everything reminds me of her .
the spin of the earth impaled a silhouette of the sun on the steeple .
and i got to hear the same sermon all the time now from you people .
why are you staring into outer space crying just because you came across it and lost it ?
everything reminds me of her .
everything reminds me of her .
everything reminds me of her .


#everything means nothing to me

someone found the future as a statue in a fountain at attention , looking backward in a pool of water , wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder who keeps singing over everything .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
i picked up the song and found my picture in the paper .
the reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute people from a time when he was everything he 's supposed to be .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .


#la

the gentleman 's in the lane spinning his hat on a cane , stepping out , out for a change .
good morning , all , it 's a beautiful day .
the general 's winning the war that seems suicidal before you came along .
now i 'll protect you as long as you 'll stay .
la morning had to come .
i 'd be walking in the sun , living in the day , but last night i was about to throw it all away .
if patience started a band , i 'd be her biggest fan .
look at me , i 'm talking to you .
i do n't want the lead in your play .
the star 's just a part of the scene , the gentleman in green paying off out on the street .
i ca n't go home .
it 's not on my way .
la things i 've never done , cars parked in the sun .
living in the day , but last night i was about to throw it all away .
last night i was about to throw it all away .
last night i was about to throw it all away .
last night i was about to throw it all away .


#in the lost and found ( honky bach )

he held his breath to hold your hand , to walk the stairsteps in pairs , climbing up a slippery slope .
i 'm in love , love i hope .
do n't go home , angelina .
stay with me , hanging around in the lost and found .
kissed you quick , feeling weird , lonely , leered , and disappeared .
this is such a simple place passing time ca n't erase .
do n't go home , angelina .
paint tomorrow blue .
day breaks and every morning , when he wakes , he thinks of you .
i 'm alone .
that 's okay .
i do n't mind .
most of the time i do n't feel afraid to die .
she was here passing by .
do n't go home , angelina .
stay with me , hanging around in the lost and found .
stay with me , hanging around in the lost and found .


#stupidity tries

got a foot in the door .
god knows what for !
and he 'll cut me down to size .
stupidity tries .
everything here is free , everything but you and me .
this painting never dries .
stupidity tries .
savannah shoulder raised a cheer , coloring the sky with ash because they found some privateer to sail across the sea of trash .
the enemy is within .
do n't confuse me with him .
the truth is otherwise .
stupidity tries .
and so i go from floor to floor looking for a port of call , another drunk conquistador conquering the governor 's ball .
i could n't think of a thing that i hope tomorrow brings .
oh , what a surprise !
stupidity tries .


#easy way out

you 'll take advantage till you think you 're being used because without an enemy your anger gets confused .
i got stuck on the side you know i never chose , but it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
there 's no escape for you , except in someone else , although you 've already disappeared within yourself , the invisible man who 's always changing clothes .
it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
while i watch you making mistakes , i wish you luck , i really do with the problem , with the puzzle , whatever 's left of you .
i heard you found another audience to bore , a creative thinker who imagined you were more , a new body for you to push around and pose .
it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .
it 's all about taking the easy way out for you , i suppose .


#would n't mama be proud

the question is , would n't mama be proud there 's a silver lining in the corporate cloud and the pretty post that you 're taking as an nco of the great pretender ?
i should sure think so !
would n't mama be proud ?
" can i take your order ? " asked the heavenly host , ticket to the jet stream blowing coast to coast , the long-stemmed glasses , a movie , and a pleasant dream in mid-air .
"you got to tell me quickly because we 're almost there . "
would n't mama be proud ?
pointed out of the window at the sky gone black .
"kid , you 're on the right track . "
if i send you postcards from the side of the road , photographs of moving parts about to implode , if i crawl to keep it together like you say you know i can do to transmit a moment from me to you , would n't mama be proud ?
would n't mama be proud ?
would n't mama be proud ?


#color bars

i see color bars when i come .
sargeant rock broke the key off in the lock to where i come from .
sir , no , sir , we have no power in the air .
the battle 's on the ground .
laying low again , high on the sound .
bruno s . is a man to me .
you 're just some dude with a stilted attitude that you learned from tv.
you 'll undo , but i 'll be connecting everything , the traffic in my town , riding high again , high on the sound .
everyone wants me to ride into the sun , but i be not going to go down .
laying low again , high on the sound .


#happiness

activity 's killing the actor and a cop 's standing out in the road turning traffic away .
there was nothing she could do until after , when his body 'd been buried below way back in the day .
oh , my , nothing else could 've been done .
he made his life a lie so he might never have to know anyone .
made his life the lie , you know .
i told him he should n't upset her and that he 'd only be making it worse involving somebody else , but i knew that he 'd never forget her while her memory worked in reverse to keep her safe from herself .
and , oh , my , nothing else could 've been done .
she made her life a lie so she might never have to know anyone .
made her life the lie , you know .
what i used to be will pass away and then you 'll see that all i want now is happiness for you and me .
what i used to be will pass away and then you 'll see that all i want now is happiness for you and me .
what i used to be will pass away and then you 'll see that all i want now is happiness for you and me .


#pretty mary k

almost forgot .
started to say .
rode into the sun , past everyone .
hallelujah , pretty mary k .
i found faith in the infirmary .
there 's a soldier lying in bed with a wound to the head , calling out to pretty mary k .
here 's what you get for things that have n't happened yet .
i happened upon pretty mary k , but a soldier 's uniform waved you away .
i walk round the dock and talk to st . james though i 'm already done and ask everyone , "have you seen her , pretty mary k ?
have you seen her , pretty mary k ? "


#i better be quiet now

wish you gave me your number .
wish i could call you today , just to hear a voice .
i got a long way to go .
i 'm getting further away .
if i did n't know the difference , living alone 'd probably be ok .
it would n't be lonely .
i got a long way to go .
i 'm getting further away .
a lot of hours to occupy , it was easy when i did n't know you yet , things i 'd have to forget , but i better be quiet now .
i 'm tired of wasting my breath , carrying on , and getting upset .
maybe i got a problem , but that 's not what i wanted to say .
i 'd prefer to say nothing .
i got a long way to go .
i 'm getting further away .
had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place while a dead enemy screams in my face , but i better be quiet now .
i 'm tired of wasting my breath , carrying on , not over it yet .
wish i knew what you 're doing and why you want to do it this way , so i ca n't go the distance .
i got a long way to go .
i 'm getting further away .
i got a long way to go .
i 'm getting further away .


#ca n't make a sound

i have become a silent movie .
the hero killed the clown .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
nobody knows what he 's doing still hanging around .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
the slow motion moves me .
the monologue means nothing to me .
bored in the role , but he ca n't stop standing up to sit back down or lose the one thing found , spinning the world like a toy top till there 's a ghost in every town .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
eyes locked and shining .
ca n't you tell me what 's happening ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?

#coast to coast

last stop for a resolution .
end of the line , is it confusion ?
so go .
go see what 's there for you .
nothing new , nothing new for you to use .
i 've got no new act to amuse you .
i 've got no desire to use you , you know , but anything that i could do would never be good enough for you .
if you ca n't help it , then just leave it alone , leave it alone .
leave it alone , yeah , just forget it .
it 's really easy .
i believe i 'll forget it too .
still you 're keeping me around till i finally drag us both down , pulling feathers out your hat .
yes , i believe that 's where it 's at .
you belong tagging along and i belong in your zoo , so i wait for confirmation that you 're never going to use your starting gun .
unless it 's me , it sounds like being him just was n't that much fun .
anything that i could do would never be good enough for you .
if you ca n't help it , then just leave it alone , leave it alone .
leave me alone , yeah , just forget it .
it 's really easy .
i 'll just forget it too .
coast to coast , coast to coast .
i 'll do what i can , so you can be what you do .
coast to coast , coast to coast .
i 'll do everything i can , so you can be what you do .
coast to coast , coast to coast .
circuit rider comes every fifth sunday .
oh , my lord , i fell asleep one day .
anything that i could do .
is there anything that i could do that someone does n't do for you , that someone did n't do for you , that i have already done for you ?


#let 's get lost

i 've been outside , invited in , but i could n't abide , would n't miss it again .
burning every bridge that i cross to find some beautiful place to get lost .
i had true love .
i made it die .
i pushed her away .
she said , please stay .
burning every bridge that i cross to find some beautiful place to get lost , to find some beautiful place to get lost .
well , i do n't know where i 'll go now and i do n't really care who follows me there , but i 'll burn every bridge that i cross and find some beautiful place to get lost and find some beautiful place to get lost .


#pretty (ugly before )

sunshine been keeping me up for days .
there is no night-time , it 's only a passing phase .
and i feel pretty , pretty enough for you .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
sometimes is all i feel up to now , but it 's not worth it to you because you got to get high somehow .
is it destruction that you require to feel , like somebody wants you , someone that 's more for real ?
sunshine been keeping me up for days .
there is no night-time , only a passing phase .
and i 'll feel pretty another hour or two .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
i felt so ugly before .
i did n't know what to do .
ugly before .


#do n't go down

i met a girl , snowball , in hell .
she was hard and as cracked as the liberty bell .
i got her to come on and move in with me and i said i 'd find a better place .
we could spend eternity .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
her mama called me a thief and her dad called himself commander in chief .
i fought him off with my love , but i knew the sense of worthlessness she would have to raise above .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
she had a dream , woke up in shock .
she had seen her own body outlined in chalk .
i split the scene , the globe been spun , and her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .


#strung out again

you get what you see .
i saw a rich fuck given charity , saw an evil emperor wearing my clothes .
they 're far from the best , but they might suit you better than the rest .
just looking in the mirror will make you a brave man .
i know my place .
i hate my face .
i know how i begin and how i 'll end , strung out again .
was a parliament of owls flying over a city of canals , floating on the body , floating in the dalles .
you get what you see .
some things , they just change invisiabally .
i do n't know where i 'm going .
i do n't even want to know .
i know my place .
i hate my face .
i know how i begin and how i 'll end , strung out again , standing , smiling on some fantasy island , waving at my lost reflection again , but a tide coming in and i 'm strung out again , strung out again .


#fond farewell

the litebrite 's now black and white because you took apart a picture that was n't right .
pitch burning on a shining sheet , the only maker that you 'd want to meet .
a dying man in a living room whose shadow paces the floor , who 'll take you out in the open door .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
it 's not what i 'm like .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who could n't get things right .
fond farewell to a friend .
he said , really , i just want to dance .
good and evil matched perfect .
it 's a great romance .
i can deal with some psychic pain if it 'll slow down my higher brain .
veins full of disappearing ink , vomiting in the kitchen sink , disconnecting from the missing link .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
it 's not what i 'm like .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who could n't get things right .
fond farewell to a friend .
i see you 're leaving me and taking up with the enemy , the cold comfort of the in between , a little less than a human being , a little less than a happy high , a little less than a suicide , the only things that you really tried .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
it 's not what i 'm like .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who could n't get things right .
fond farewell to a friend .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .


#king 's crossing

the king 's crossing is the main attraction .
dominoes are falling in a chain reaction .
the scraping subject , ruled by fear , told me whiskey works better than beer .
the judge is on vinyl , decisions are final , and nobody gets a reprieve .
and every wave is tidal .
if you hang around , you 're going to get wet .
i ca n't prepare for death any more than i already have .
all you can do now is watch the shells .
the game looks easy .
that 's why it sells .
frustrated fireworks inside your head are going to stand and deliver , talk instead .
the method acting that pays my bills keeps a fat man feeding in beverly hills .
i got a heavy-metal mouth that hurls obscenity and i get my check from the trash treasury because i took my own insides out .
it do n't matter because i have no sex life .
all i want to do now is inject my ex-wife .
i 've seen the movie and i know what happens .
it 's christmas time and the needle 's on the tree .
a skinny santa is bringing something to me .
his voice is overwhelming , but his speech is slurred and i only understand every other word .
open your parachute and grab your gun , falling down like an omen , a setting sun .
read the part and return at five .
it 's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive , but i do n't care if i fuck up .
i 'm going on a date with a rich , white lady .
be not life great ?
give me one good reason not to do it , so do it .
this is the place where time reverses .
dead men talk to all the pretty nurses .
instruments shine on a silver tray .
do n't let me get carried away .
do n't let me get carried away .
do n't let me be carried away .


#twilight

have n't laughed this hard in a long time .
i better stop now before i start crying .
go off to sleep in the sunshine .
i do n't want to see the day when it 's dying .
she 's a sight to see .
she 's good to me .
i 'm already somebody 's baby .
she 's a pretty thing and she knows everything , but i 'm already somebody 's baby .
you do n't deserve to be lonely , but those drugs you got wo n't make you feel better .
pretty soon you 'll find it 's the only little part of your life you 're keeping together .
i 'm nice to you .
i could make it through that you 're already somebody 's baby .
i could make you smile if you stayed awhile , but how long will you stay with me , baby ?
because your candle burns too bright .
well , i almost forgot it was twilight .
even if i think that you are right , well , i 'm tired of being down .
i got no fight .
you 're wonderful when it 's beautiful , but i 'm already somebody 's baby and , if i went with you , i 'd disappoint you too .
well , i 'm already somebody 's baby , already somebody 's baby .


# a passing feeling

everything is gone but the echo of the burst of a shell and i 'm stuck here waiting for a passing feeling in the city i built up and blew to hell .
i 'm stuck here waiting for a passing feeling .
still i sinned all the time .
my request for relief down the dead power lines though i 'm beyond belief in the help i require just to exist at all .
took a long time to stand .
took an hour to fall .
i 'm stuck here waiting for a passing feeling , stuck here waiting for a passing feeling .
still i sinned all the time .
my request for relief down the dead power lines though i 'm beyond belief in the help i require just to exist at all .
took a long time to stand .
took an hour to fall .


#last hour

here 's the army that you mowed to the ground and the bodies you left lying around .
talking it out the last hour .
i 'm through trying now .
it 's a big relief .
i 'll be staying down where no one else going to give me grief , mess me around .
just make it over .
your opinion was the law of the land , a single thing that i could n't always understand .
i lived it out from hour to hour , the only thing that never really changed .
you ran me all around and dragged me down at the end of the day .
do n't keep me around .
just make it over .
i 've been thinking of the things that i missed , situations that i passed up for this one-way love i took for ours .
i 'm through trying now .
it 's a big relief .
i 'll be staying down .
i was n't good at being a thief , more like a clown .
make it over .


#shooting star

you 'll make the scene like you always do , going upstream down the avenue to fuck some trophy boy that you 'll win tonight at the bar .
so bad , so far .
you 'll make him sad , shooting star .
when it was me , i was momentarily proud , drunk on dreams now i 'm glad i did n't say out loud .
you said you 'd be for real , but i do n't believe that you are .
so bad , so far .
you make me sad , shooting star .
you 're distant and cold and a sight to behold .
everybody just sighs .
but no one gets on with you very long because you do n't feel bad when you lie .
i 'm going to sleep now , going back to find square one .
square two be where i can deal with the shit you 've just done .
it wo n't be soon .
say the least , it 's going to be hard .
so bad , so far .
your love is sad , shooting star .
your love is sad , shooting star .


#memory lane

this is the place you 'll end up when you lose the chase where you 're dragged against your will from a basement on the hill and all anybody knows is you 're not like them and they kick you in the head and send you back to bed .
isolation pulled you past a tunnel to a bright world where you can make a place to stay , but everybody 's scared of this place .
they 're staying away , your little house on memory lane .
the mayor 's name is fear .
his force patrols the pier from a mountain of cliche that advances everyday .
the doctor spoke a cloud .
he rained out loud .
you 'll keep your doors and windows shut and swear you 'll never show a soul again , but isolation pushes you till every muscle aches down the only road it ever takes , but everybody 's scared of this place .
they 're staying away , your little house on memory lane .
if it 's your decision to be open about yourself , be careful or else , be careful or else .
uncomfortable apart , it 's all written on my chart .
and i take what 's given to me most cooperatively .
i do what people say and lie in bed all day absolutely horrified .
i hope you 're satisfied .
isolation pushes past self-hatred , guilt , and shame to a place where suffering is just a game , but everybody 's scared of this place .
they 're staying away , your little house on memory lane , your little house on memory lane .


#little one

one more little one .
i 'll go down , stay down , sleep the rest of the day , dream new music to calm down , stay down and keep evil away .
i can hear you asleep changing your shape , dissolved in some dream as a new one appears to take you along where you 've never been .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
the moonlight tonight seems to belong to me because , even though some ca n't sleep , i need some company .
one hit would n't hurt a bit at all .
slow down , sleep.
what 's .
if it 's good shit , you wo n't know .
and i wo n't know the fact that i 'm dying if i seem to be reckless with myself .
it 's the fault of no one .
all things have a place under the moon as well as the sun .
one more little one .
i love you .


# a distorted reality is now a neccessity to be free

i 'm floating in a black balloon , o.d . on easter afternoon .
my mama told me , baby , stay clean .
there 's no in-between .
and , all you ladies and you gentlemen , between is all you 've ever seen or been .
fit poorly and arrange the sight .
doll it up in virgin white .
you disappoint me , you people raking in on the world .
the devil 's script sells you the heart of a blackbird .
shine on me , baby , because it 's raining in my heart .
sun is rising on a chopping glare .
rain dropping acid blotter in the air .
a distorted reality 's now a necessity to be free .
so disappointing .
so , first i put it all down to luck .
god knows why my country do n't give a fuck .
fuck .
shine on me , baby , because it 's raining in my heart .
shine on me , baby , because it 's raining in my heart .

#angel in the snow

i 'd say you make a perfect angel in the snow , all crushed out on the way you are .
better stop before it goes too far .
do n't you know that i love you ?
sometimes i feel like only a cold , still life that fell down here to lay beside you .
do n't you know that i love you ?
sometimes i feel like only a cold , still life , only a frozen , still life that fell down here to lay beside you .


#talking to mary

talking to mary , you know you do n't have to shout .
she can hear what you 're thinking like you 're saying it right out loud .
she sees behind that dirty look .
it was her that followed down every stupid turn that you took .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
saw the one big problem you keep under your hat and it 's pretty unlikely that anybody else would be cool with that .
you got bus fare in your pocket and more money down in your sock , but she ca n't tell you how to contact her if you wo n't listen to her talk .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
it 's no problem .
i 'll just keep quiet if it 's easier for you to make believe in that i do n't love you as much as i do .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
i told you so .
i told you so .


#high times

coma kid taught me how he 'd come to follow you around wherever you go , said i do n't go where i 'm supposed to go , and i do n't go really anywhere , you know ?
told me how he 's driven by a curse till he kicked out into reverse , said i do n't go where i 'm supposed to go , and i do n't go really anywhere , you know ?
i made up my mind and i do n't mind saying so .
i went to meet you at central square and , when i could n't find you there , i went walking around the city some more , people-watching with a cold , blank stare , and i saw your face in everyone , i swear .
seems i never get your kick quite right .
i was walking slow to a dirty dive .
i 'm so sick and tired trying to change your mind when it 's so easy to disconnect mine .
high times , high times , high times .
yeah , i feel fine .
high times , high times , high times .
man , i feel fine .
do n't pick me up .
i 'm fine right where i am .
i do n't go where i 'm supposed to go , where i 'm supposed to go .


#new monkey

here comes the sidewalk-boss again , telling me how i ca n't cave in , that i 'm a study in black , need a pat on the back .
i looked up and smiled , a picture of dissatisfaction that he can only see as a junkie .
though i might be straight as an arrow , he 's busy shaking hands with my monkey , busy shaking hands with my monkey .
i go in my car straight to the bar where my sweetie pours the beer for the millions of fans ignoring the bands .
he 's in my ear , wants me to live in denial , says you 've got to settle for something .
though it might not be really living , anything is better than nothing , anything is better than nothing .
no happy action-man going to move in to take my place .
i 'll be pumping out the product , just a total waste .
look at your hands unoccupied .
look at the lengths you 'll go to hide .
you 're under the veil , pretending to fail , got a whole lot of empty time left to go .
now you 've got to fill it with something .
i know what you can do .
do n't you know anything is better than nothing ?
no happy action-man going to move in to take my place .
i 'll be pumping out the product , just a total waste .
i 'm here with my cup , afraid to look up .
this is how i spend my time , lazing around , head hanging down , stuck inside my imagination , busy making something from nothing , pictures of hope and depression .
anything is better than nothing .
anything is better than nothing .
anything is better than nothing .
anything is better than nothing .


#looking over my shoulder

wiped out in the city slick , another sick rock 'n roller acting like a dick , needing cash , burning through the trash that piles up in this place and fills up behind my empty face full of things that i 'm not to do .
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i do n't want to know and i 'm looking over my shoulder , booking away with nowhere to go .
i run down to the corner lot .
it 's forty-five past two .
i almost forgot to show .
got a date to make with mr . so-and-so , after which i wo n't care when you all start to bitch and moan about being alone .
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i do n't want to know and i 'm looking over my shoulder , booking away with nowhere to go .
well , ca n't you just leave me alone ?
you 've already thrown all the sticks and stones you had to send my way .
well , ca n't you just leave it at that and spare us both the bother because i just bounce back , anyway ?
i got nothing that i want to do more than make another sonnet fuck-you to play whenever you make my life cliche so to fit in some little box with all the labelled shit you would say to keep confusion away .
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i do n't want to know and i 'm looking over my shoulder , booking away with nowhere to go .
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i do n't want to know and i 'm looking over my shoulder , booking away .


#going nowhere

he waved hello , silent like a mime .
there 's no changing my mind .
i wo n't walk the stairs with you tonight going nowhere .
the clock moved a quarter of a turn , the time it took a cigarette to burn .
she said , you got a lot of things to learn going nowhere .
saw you move a certain way , missed you a lot , returned to this abandoned place , should 've been forgot .
echoes drown the conversation out , echoes that only seem to bring about a silent expression , things you may allow , going nowhere .
the steps made a pattern i 'd never seen .
i felt like a kid of six or seventeen .
i was off in some empty daydream going nowhere .
it 's dead and gone , matter of fact .
maybe for the best .
said some things you ca n't take back honestly , i guess .
the old records sitting on the floor , the ones i ca n't put on anymore .
he walked over to her like before going nowhere , going nowhere , going nowhere .


#riot coming

in storyville i fucked a cop amped up on prescription pills that brought my heart to a stop and i want to tell you there 's a riot coming like a drug in the water .
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters .
i met a girl on the square who showed me how to kill my cares , but once that 's done , man , there 's nothing to do .
time 's running backwards from me and you .
there 's a riot coming like a drug in the water .
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters .
my body 's running , but i do n't see why it bothers .
sat down and jelled with this friend of mine who 'd never close both his eyes , but one was shut all the time to cover the thing he was scared of while he watched with the other .
there was a riot coming like a drug in the water .
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters .
there 's a riot coming .
there 's a riot coming .
there 's a riot coming .


#all cleaned out

here comes your pride and joy , the comic little drunk you call your boy making everybody smile , who takes your pretty plan and then becomes a disappearing man after a little while .
i saw you with your makeup running down .
now , what 's that all about ?
you say you do n't want anyone around because you 're all cleaned out .
you toss the empty beer not really as composed as you appear , an icicle inside , wearing clothes that clash , wondering , "is this treasure or is this trash ?" , still trying to decide and about 5 o'clock here comes your clown with the foot he 's throwing down .
but all you say is you do n't want anyone around .
come not right now .
there be not nothing to dream .
you do n't want to think about it .
i 'm sorry you seem so stoned and i 'm sorry you think you have to hold your tongue when you 're so pretty and smart .
i 'm seeing you caving in , becoming afraid of all these men that you 've given your heart .
i saw you with your makeup running down .
now , what 's that all about ?
you say you do n't want anyone around because you 're all cleaned out , all cleaned out , all cleaned out .


# first timer

i 'm a first timer , wishing i was someone else when i see you by yourself in a corridor where you find yourself now blocked by a door you locked .
you wo n't do what the doctor ordered .
you wo n't see someone else .
come on back to me , my bright tomorrow .
you say you feel hollow and you know it 's because you are , well , at least so far .
i think of you with hesitation .
i think of you too hard .
come on back to me , but do n't make me sorry .
i 'm a first timer , wishing i 'd been someone else , seeing you by yourself , seeing you by yourself .


#go by

go on and parade and fade , hit the scene and slow , spending all your time with some girl you 'll never get to know , wound uptight , dressed all in white , blowing out to drift .
need you even here .
you live up in your head , scared of every little noise , someone always breaking in accidentally using nothing but their voice , shrill and small echo down the hall , repeating pet names , sitting in your eyes .
you 're only passing by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
someone 's in the way .
pretty words and inside slurs , all the things they have to say to perform the work that they 've rehearsed .
it 's a waste of time .
i put it behind me once and for all and let the time decline if the problem was n't mine .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .
go by .


#miss misery

i 'll fake it through the day with some help from johnny walker red and the cold pain behind my eyes that shoots back through my head , with two tickets torn in half and a lot of nothing to do , but it 's alright because some enchanted night i 'll be with you .
tarot cards and the lines in my hand tell me i 'm wrong , but then untrue .
got plans for both of us that involved a trip out of town to a place i 've seen in a magazine that you left lying around .
i ca n't hold my liquor , but i keep a good attitude because it 's alright .
some enchanted night i 'll be with you and ,
though you 'd rather see me gone than to see this , come the day i 'll be waiting for you , anyway .
next door the tv 's flashing blue frames on the wall .
it 's a comedy from the 70 's with a lead no one recalls , vanished into oblivion .
it 's easy to do .
and i cried to sleep when you talked to me the day you said we were through , but it 's alright .
some enchanted night i 'll be with you .


#thirteen

wo n't you let me walk you home from school ?
wo n't you let me meet you at the pool ?
maybe friday i can get tickets from the dance and i 'll take you , ooh , ooh , ooh .
wo n't you tell your dad get off my back ?
tell him what we said about "paint it black" .
rock and roll is here to stay .
well , come inside while it 's ok and i 'll shake you , ooh , ooh , ooh .
wo n't you tell me what you 're thinking of ?
would you be an outlaw for my love ?
if it 's so , well , let me know .
if it 's no , well , i can go .
i wo n't make you , ooh , ooh , ooh .


#georgia georgia

georgia , georgia , it 's been many miles since i 've seen your fallen smile close up and personal , your arsenal of excuses .
you never told her when you walked out on this vanished shoulder with your veins all full of beer , thinking , well , at least now everything is clear .
oh , man , what plan , suicide .
it 's just not that much different from my own affair , always cussing and crying .
how about if you tell me something new , tell me what will make you happy ?
oh , you so deserve to be .
there were protests and contests , actions to cop .
i want it all to stop .
three weeks ago you were all grace and charm and now i know it was just a false alarm .
georgia , georgia , i ca n't understand your sins .
you have no forgiveness , no attention left to pay .
the quiet way you leave and just forget it all just takes my breath away .
how 's that supposed to make me feel ?
yeah , well , how am i suppossed to feel ?


# whatever ( folk song in c )

they come here alone and they leave in twos , except for you and me who just came to you as if you 're all done like you said you 'd be .
what are you doing hanging out with me ?
why you tell me stuff that 's so plainly untrue ?
if you 'll be straight with me , i 'll be straighter with you .
if you 're all done like you said you 'd be , what are you doing hanging out with me ?
i have n't wanted to do anything for a long time , but whatever you got right now would probably suit me fine .
if you 're all done like you said you 'd be , what are you doing hanging out with me ?
i have n't wanted to do anything for a long time .

if you 're all done like you said you 'd be , what are you doing hanging out with me ?

#big decision

pick me up in an hour or so .
i do n't really recommend it , no .
they 'll probably just put you down .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
you ca n't kick when you 're down .
got a feeling kind of like a cough .
be not nothing going to shake it off , be not nothing going to shake it off until you talk out loud .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
you ca n't kick when you 're down .
the chromium car reflects you are .
taking you home , i 'm under your spell .
ca n't you tell ?
do n't you know ?
god , people wonder if you 're sick , spilled out on the city slick , buffed up like a macho jerk .
do n't even try it .
it 'll never work .
why , you wonder ?
what , you wonder , for me ?
why , you wonder ?
what , you wonder , for me ?
why you want what i can not be ?
you know i wo n't stay sober .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i believe you .
i want to be you .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
i know you 're not through with it yet .
it 's a big decision .
you ca n't kick when you 're down .


#placeholder

looking at all the rows , all these records look like big zeros .
got your picture on the back of a forty-five , a placeholder till you take up mine , a placeholder till you take up mine .
i 'm the person you 'll never need , the biggest loser on sixteenth street , the invisible man with the see-through mind , a placeholder till you take up mine , a placeholder till you take up mine .
break off in someone 's laughter every time i 'm there next to the square .
he likes the way that you look now like an open book .
just like my favorite song , some pretty words that did n't last that long , like a package sent priority overnight .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
placeholder , come and take up mine .
placeholder , come and take up mine .


#new disaster

ghost of your smile is always looking for new bodies to haunt and it 's been here , it is up here .
he 's hanging around and he 'll wait for a while , gradually gone .
it 's pleasing and freezing while i wonder what it is you 're after , keeping company with this disaster .
you looked all over town , got turned around to walk back through the mud , the kind you had left behind you .
everybody 's the same in this long knowing game where every new blood gets time to become resigned .
now i wonder what it is you 're after , keeping company with this disaster , why you never try to tame your master .
you just blow through the coals , blow through the coals , blow through the coals till everyone knows that your smile is just a ghost .
the ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park .
it 's old news .
you see that it 's no use .
you 're waiting to start , waiting to light .
wait until dark .
i told you , man .
i told you .
while i wonder what it is you 're after , keeping company with this disaster , why you never try to tame your master .


#seen how things are hard

i took you to the train .
stupid shit you displayed .
i took pictures in my head .
you , an opening stare only , had a little dressy date , just did n't care .
you were all getting drunk instead .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , do n't you know ?
listening to what you thought was a dizzy height , freaked out and forgot you stay well away from trouble that you caused , using all your strength to keep the world at an arm 's length and not get upset because something goes wrong .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , dont you know ?
i 'm a crap reflection of you .
i cant make corrections for you .
you have to help me patch things up .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , do n't you know ?
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
i love you , though .
seen how things are hard .
seen how things are hard .
well , do n't you know ?


#fear city

dragged down into lowercase , trying to get your cops to talk right , but they ca n't put the paper in your face .
you 're just trying to walk by , so now i got a new game , baby .
no one 's going to recognize it , your broken english over their flat , tired remarks still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
i can do everything that your man does , except for better , got no interest now in undressing your kids .
with cheap angst love letters you write your name in all of the places no one goes .
some ca n't be satisfied until everybody knows .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
come on .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .


#either/or

you 're strong .
you 're stubborn now in an endless symbolic war , brave or bored , either/or .
sometimes i ricochet from the past and at times a future i 've already had before , champion or chore , either/or .
i 'll write the pages you rip out back in their places again .
one day you 'll know what you 're talking about .
i can hardly imagine , but until then i 'll be filling in these blanks that you create every time you win some petty score posing as hardcore , oh , yeah , either/or .
look at the spin chief , battered and broken , clutching a plastic rose .
we 're all in the downpour you carry around for trashing a lifestyle you 've never known .
it 's a useful dream that makes quite an entertaining show and not much more up against and for , either/or .


#pretty mary k ( other version )

pretty mary k walks along the docks with some sailor 's pay shoved down in her sock .
pretty mary k with some little boy in blue who ca n't stay away from you .
pretty mary k , take him back to town .
i 'm down here by the bay where the water pounds up against the wall , crying black and blue .
it keeps me away from you .
pretty words that you whisper .
maybe i misunderstood .
somebody 's not paying attention to what they promised and their word is n't good .
oh , mary k , i can see her face down there in the waves , painted and erased , but i know it 's just the reflection of the moon , a big fake resembling you .
going to go down in the water , fill my mouth up full of sand .
i 'll be waiting , still impatient , with my dead imagination while you 're with some other man .
pretty mary k is off in somebody 's room .
i 'm down here by the bay with my arm around the moon , but i 'll be with you soon .
just as soon as i pay , i walk across the water with pretty mary k , walk on the water , pretty mary k .


#almost over

think i 'm unkind ?
the people are n't the way you think they are .
they ca n't remember all the time what it was you wanted .
they paint you out in straight silhouette , but do n't you get the picture yet ?
why you getting all upset ?
the worst part is almost over .
three 's such a crowd .
you ought to tell me what you tell yourself .
you ever going to speak it aloud ?
do i have to guess like everyone else ?
with an iron will to walk the walk and the glass jaw that ca n't be moved to talk , black eyes always watch the clock .
the worst part is almost over .
you let yourself be froze by death .
you think i 'm mean because i call you out .
you do n't know what you 're about .
the worst part is almost over now .
the worst part is almost over now , now , now .


#see you later

i got a choke-chain made out of night-rain to keep your memory down in quicksand from the main man , to drown everything out .
we were out on a joyride , fucked up from insides , always at a dead stall from sticking pins into miniature men who ca n't feel it at all .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
walk through thick mud looking for new blood , thinking i heard your name , cruel imagination still giving you pain just to find you with your master-minder running your affairs , saying how your better now since it killed all your other cares .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .


#half right

well , you should n't doctor yourself .
well , i pictured somebody else , someone that looks like what i look like .
would you say that the one of your dreams got in you and ripped out the seams ?
that 's what i 'd say .
that 's what i 'd say .
he was a sucker for your double-dose .
motherfucker turned white as a ghost .
do n't you say hi .
do n't you say hi .
with a broken sink for a face and a head that just takes up space , he 's not half right , he 's not half right .
it 's already half past and it wo n't last .
i was sticking up for my friend .
well , there 's nothing much to defend .
it 's a lost fight , it 's a lost fight because , when i talk to you on the phone , well , it 's just like being alone .
it 's not half right .
it 's not half right .

#roman candle

he played himself , did n't need me to give him hell .
he could be cool and cruel to you and me , knew we 'd put up with anything .
i want to hurt him .
i want to give him pain .
i 'm a roman candle .
my head is full of flames .
i 'm hallucinating , hallucinating .
i hear you cry .
your tears are cheap , wet , hot red swollen cheeks .
fall alseep.
i want to hurt him .
i want to give him pain .
i 'm a roman candle .
my head is full of flames .
i want to hurt him .
i want to hurt him .
i want to hurt him .
i want to give him pain and make him feel this pretty burn .


#condor avenue

she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue and she locked the car and slipped past into rhythmic quietude , lights burning , voice dry and hoarse .
i threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth .
the chimes fell over each other .
i fell onto my knees .
the sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased ,
a sick shouting like you hear at the fairground .
now i 'm picking up to put away anything of yours that 's still around .
i do n't know what to do with your clothes or your letters .
it 'll make a whisper out of you .
she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue .
the fairground 's lit , a drunk man sits by the gate she 's driving through , got his hat tipped , bottle back in between his teeth .
looks like he 's buried in the sand at the beach .
i ca n't think about you driving off to leave barely awake to take a little nap while the road is straight .
i wish that car had never been discovered .
they took away the bottle and the hat he was under .
that 's the one thing that he could never do and it 'll make a whisper out of you .
she took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue .
cops were running around the scene , looking for some kind of clue .
they never get uptight when a moth gets crushed , unless a lightbulb really loved him very much .
i 'm lying down , blowing smoke from my cigarette , little whisper smoke-signs that you 'll never get .
you 're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon , headlights burning bright ahead of you .
and someone 's burning out , out on condor avenue , trying to make a whisper out of you .
what a shitty thing to say .
did you really mean it ?
you never said a word to me about what passed between us , so now i 'm leaving you alone .
you can do whatever the hell you want to .


# no name # 1

at a party he was waiting , looking kind of spooky and withdrawn , like he could be underwater , the mighty mother with her hundred arms swept all aside .
i hate to walk behind other people 's ambition .
i saw you waiting saint-like with your warning .
leave alone .
you do n't belong here .
he got nervous , started whistling , every thought a ricochet .
did you notice ?
well , i wondered , what 's the worst thing i could say ?
and i froze up and sighed .
you remind me of someone 's daughter .
i forgot her , i forgot her name ashamed .
go home and live with your pain .
leave alone .
leave alone because you know you do n't belong .
you do n't belong here .
and when i go , do n't you follow .
leave alone .
leave alone because you know you do n't belong .
you do n't belong here .
slip out quiet .
nobody 's looking .
leave alone .
you do n't belong here .


# no name # 2

concrete hands picked up the telephone-ring .
do you know who you 're talking to ?
no , and i do n't care who , she whispered quiet terror news .
he did n't give a hoot , said do what you have to do .
all she had to do was speak , mouthpiece to cheek .
please say no more .
i 'm lying here on the ground , a strip of wet concrete .
her name was just a broken sound , a struffle step you hear when you 're falling down .
killing time wo n't stop this crying .
killing time wo n't stop this crying .
killing time wo n't stop this crying .
you better start watching what message that you send now , no more situations i only go in to be kicked out .
he got knocked down leaning like he ran into a clothesline and remembered a couple of words that hid a crime .
you 're just fine .
you 'll be just fine , but i 'm on the other line .
killing time wo n't stop this crying .
killing time wo n't stop this crying .
killing time wo n't stop this crying .


# no name # 3

we arrived too late .
our mouths were opening .
i turned off the light .
so come on night .
you 're a witness , you .
you 've seen me interrupt
a good old-fashioned fight .
so come on night .
everyone is gone , home to oblivion , home to oblivion , home to oblivion .
watched the dying day blushing in the sky .
everyone is uptight .
so come on night .
everyone is gone , home to oblivion , home to oblivion , home to oblivion .
i know we 're not illegitimate in our hearing .
so come on , so come on night .


#drive all over town

two-dollar color pictures from a photo booth , dirty , stepped on , lying out on the floor of their room .
faces fell long in the half-light .
he looks all wrong , but that 's her alright .
look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight .
he knew the one time with the army captain he got one that whole deal before it happened , said it 's okay , i knew exactly what you meant when you said you were an accident .
but , when it 's 3 am , he wonders where in the hell she went and he 'll drive all over town , drive all over town , and he 'll drive all over town , drive all over town .
until he tracks her down , he 'll drive all over town .


# no name # 4

for a change she got out before he hurt her bad , took her records and clothes and pictures of her boy .
it really made her sad .
packed it up and did n't look back .
i 'm okay , let 's just forget about him .
the car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine .
in her bag i saw things she drew when she was nine , like this one here , her alone , nobody near .
what a shame .
let 's just not talk about it .
no , it does n't look like you , but you did wear cowboy boots .
that 's your fame , there 's no question about it .
once we got back inside , with one ear to the ground i was ready to hide because i do n't know who 's around and you look scared .
it 's our secret .
do not tell , okay ?
let 's just not talk about it .
do n't tell , okay ?
let 's just forget all about it .


#last call

last call , he was sick of it all , asleep at home .
told you off and goodbye .
well , you know one day it 'll come to haunt you , that you did n't tell him quite the truth .
you 're a crisis .
you 're a icicle .
you 're a tongueless talker .
you do n't care what you say .
you 're a jaywalker and you just just walk away and that 's all you do .
the clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes made him wonder who he thought that he knew .
last call , he was sick of it all .
the endless stream of reminders made him so sick of you , sick of you , sick of you , sick of your sound , sick of you coming around trying to crawl under my skin when i already shed my best defense .
it comes out all around that you won and i think i 'm all done .
you can switch me off safely while i 'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me .
yeah , yeah , you 're still here , but just check to make sure .
all you aspired to do was endure .
you ca n't ask for more , ask for none , knowing you 'll never get that which you ask for , so you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon .
you start to drink .
you just want to continue .
it 'll all be yesteryear soon .
you start to drink .
you just want to continue .
it 'll all be yesteryear soon .
church bells and now i 'm awake and i guess it must be some kind of holiday .
i ca n't be seen to join in the celebration , but i 'll go to the service and i 'll go to pray and i 'll sing the praises of my maker 's name like i was as good as she made me and i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me , i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me ,
i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me , i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me , i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me , i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me , i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me , i wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me .
i 'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me .

#sweet adeline

cut this picture into you and me .
burn it backwards .
kill this history .
make it over .
make it stay away or hate 'll say the ending that love started to stay .
there 's a kid a floor below me saying , brother , can you spare sunshine for a brother ?
old man winter 's in the air .
walked me up a story , asking how you are .
told me not to worry , you were just a shooting star .
sweet adeline , sweet adeline , my clementine , sweet adeline .
it 's a picture-perfect evening and i 'm staring down the sun , fully loaded , deaf and dumb and done , waiting for sedation to disconnect my head or any situation where i 'm better off than dead .


#tomorrow tomorrow

everybody knows which way you go , straight to over .
no one wants to see you inside of me , straight to over .
i heard the hammer at the lock say you 're deaf and dumb and done .
give yourself another talk .
this time make it sound like someone .
the noise is coming out and , if it 's not out now , then tomorrow , tomorrow .
they took your life apart and called you failure 's art .
they were wrong , though .
they wo n't know till tomorrow .
i got static in my head , the reflected sound of everything .
tried to go to where it led , but it did n't lead to anything .
the noise is coming out and , if it 's not out now , i know it 's just about to drown tomorrow out .


#waltz # 2

first the mic , then a half cigarette .
singing cathy 's clown .
that 's the man that she 's married to now .
that 's the girl that he takes around town .
she appears composed , so she is , i suppose .
who can really tell ?
she shows no emotion at all , stares into space like a dead china doll .
i 'm never going to know you now , but i 'm going to love you anyhow .
now she 's done and they 're calling someone such a familiar name .
i 'm so glad that my memory 's remote because i 'm doing just fine hour to hour , note to note .
here it is , the revenge to the tune .
you 're no good , you 're no good , you 're no good , you 're no good .
ca n't you tell that it 's well understood ?
i 'm never going to know you now , but i 'm going to love you anyhow .
i 'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on .
i 'm tired .
i 'm tired .
looking out on the substitute scene , still going strong .
xo , mom .
it 's ok , it 's alright , nothing 's wrong .
tell mr . man with impossible plans to just leave me alone in the place where i make no mistakes , in the place where i have what it takes .
i 'm never going to know you now , but i 'm going to love you anyhow .
i 'm never going to know you now , but i 'm going to love you anyhow .
i 'm never going to know you now , but i 'm going to love you anyhow .


#baby britain

baby britain feels the best floating over a sea of vodka , separated from the rest .
fights problems with bigger problems .
sees the ocean fall and rise .
counts the waves that somehow did n't hit her .
water pouring from her eyes , alcoholic and very bitter .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart and i ca n't help until you start .
we knocked another couple back , the dead soldiers lined up on the table still prepared for an attack .
they did n't know they 'd been disabled .
felt a wave , a rush of blood .
you wo n't be happy till the bottle 's broken and you 're out swimming in the flood you kept back , you kept unspoken .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart and i ca n't help until you start .
you got a look in your eye when you 're saying goodbye like you want to say hi .
the light was on , but it was dim .
revolver 's been turned over and now it 's ready once again .
the radio was playing " crimson and clover " .
london bridge is safe and sound .
no matter what you keep repeating , nothing 's going to drag me down to a death that 's not worth cheating .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart and i ca n't help until you start .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart .


#pitseleh

i 'll tell you why i do n't want to know where you are .
i got a joke i been dying to tell you .
a silent kid is looking down the barrel to make the noise that i kept so quiet .
i kept it from you , pitseleh .
i 'm not what 's missing from your life now .
i could never be the puzzle pieces .
they say that god makes problems just to see what you can stand before you do as the devil pleases and give up the thing you love , but no one deserves it .
the first time i saw you i knew it would never last .
i 'm not half what i wish i was .
i 'm so angry .
i do n't think it 'll ever pass .
and i was bad news for you just because i never meant to hurt you .


#independence day

future butterfly going to spend the day higher than high .
you 'll be beautiful confusion .
ooh , once i was you .
i saw you caught between all the people out making the scene and a bright ideal tomorrow .
ooh , do n't go too far .
stay who you are .
everybody knows , everybody knows , everybody knows you only live a day , but it 's brilliant anyway .
i saw you in a perfect place .
it 's going to happen soon but not today .
so go to sleep and make the change .
i 'll meet you here tomorrow , independence day , independence day , independence day .


#bled white

i 'm a color reporter ( rose city on the 409 ) , but the city 's been bled white ( white city on the yellow line ) .
and the doctor orders ( drinking till he 's trashed is just a waste of time ) .
he drinks all night to take away this curse , but it makes me feel much worse .
bled white .
so i wait for the f-train ( white city on the yellow line ) and connect through a friend of mine ( white city to a friend of mine ) to a yesterday-dream (yesterday a dream was just a waste of time ) because i 'll have to be high to track the sunset down and paint this pailing town .
bled white .
so here he comes with a blank expression , especially for me because he knows i feel the same because happy and sad come in quick succession .
i 'm never going to become what you became .
do n't you dare disturb me ( do n't complicate my piece of mind ) while i 'm balancing my past ( do n't complicate my piece of mind ) because you ca n't help or hurt me ( the anger , being mean was just a waste of time ) like it already has .
it may not seem quite right , but i 'm not fucked , not quite .
bled white .
bled white .


#waltz # 1

every time the day darkens down and goes away , pictures open in my head of me and you , silent and cliche , all the things we did and did n't say , covered up by what we did and did n't do , going through every out i used to cop to make the repetition stop .
what was i supposed to say ?
now i never leave my zone .
we 're both alone .
i 'm going home .
i wish i 'd never seen your face .


#amity

amity , amity , amity , amity , amity , amity , amity caught stars in her arms .
hello , hello , kitty , happy in new york city .
amity walking like a lucky charm .
i 'm a neon sign and i stay open all the time .
so let 's go , go , go , go .
amity , amity , god do n't make no junk , but it 's plain to see he still made me .
he told me so .
i 'm good to go .
i 'm ready to go because you laugh and talk and because you make my world rock .
i 'm so , so , so , so , amity , amity , amity , amity , amity , amity , amity , good to go .


#oh well okay

here 's the silhouette , the face always turned away , the bleeding color gone to black , dying like a day .
could n't figure out what made you so unhappy .
shook your head to say no , no , no and stopped for a spell and stayed that way .
oh , well , okay .
i got pictures .
i just do n't see it anymore .
climbing hour upon hour through a total bore with the one i keep where it never fades in the safety of a pitch-black mind , an airless cell that blocks the day .
oh , well , okay .
if you a get a feeling the next time you see me , do me a favor and let me know because it 's hard to tell , it 's hard to say .
oh , well , okay .
oh , well , okay .
oh , well , okay .


#bottle up and explode !

bottle up and explode over and over ,
keep the troublemaker below .
put it away and check out for the day and in for a round of overexposure , the thing mother nature provides to get up and go .
bottle up and explode , seeing the stars surrounding you , red , white and blue .
you look at him like you 've never known him , but i know for a fact that you have .
the last time you cried , who 'd you think was inside ?
thinking that you were about to come over , but i 'm tired now of waiting for you .
you never show .
bottle up and go .
if you 're going to hide , it 's up to you .
i 'm coming through .
bottle up and go .
i can make it outside .
i 'll get though becoming you , becoming you , becoming you .


# a question mark

i got a question mark .
i got a need to always take some shot in the dark .
i do n't have to make pretend the picture i 'm in is totally clear .
you think that all things have a way they ought to appear because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know i do n't .
i dream .
do n't know what you mean .
panic called you out and took you in , giving you an easy game and letting you win .
you 're giving back a little hatred now to the world because it treated you bad , because you could n't keep the great unknown from making you mad , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know i do n't .
i dream .
do n't know what you mean .
said your final word , but honesty and love could 've kept us together .
one day you 'll see it 's worth it after all .
if you ever want to say you 're sorry , you can give me a call .


#everybody cares , everybody understands

everybody cares , everybody understands .
yes , everybody cares about you , yeah , and whether or not you want them to .
it 's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head to a pure synthetic sympathy that infuriates you totally and a quiet lie that makes you want to scream and shout .
so here i lay dreaming , looking at the brilliant sun raining its guiding light upon everyone .
for a moment 's rest you can lean against the banister after running upstairs again and again from wherever they came to fix you in , but always fear city 's finest follow right behind .
you got a pretty vision in your head , a pencil full of poison lead , and a sickened smile illegal in every town .
so here i lay dreaming , looking at the brilliant sun raining its guiding light upon everyone .
here i lay dreaming , looking at the brilliant sun raining its guiding light upon everyone .
you say you mean well .
you do n't know what you mean .
fucking ought to stay the hell away from things you know nothing about .


#i did n't understand

thought you 'd be looking for the next in line to love , then ignore , put out and put away .
and so you 'd soon be leaving me alone like i 'm supposed to be tonight , tomorrow , and every day .
there 's nothing here that you 'll miss .
i can guarantee you this is a cloud of smoke , trying to occupy space .
what a fucking joke .
what a fucking joke .
i waited for a bus to separate the both of us and take me off far away from you because my feelings never change a bit .
i always feel like shit .
i do n't know why .
i guess that i just do .
you once talked to me about love and you painted pictures of a never-neverland and i could 've gone to that place , but i did n't understand , i did n't understand , i did n't understand .
