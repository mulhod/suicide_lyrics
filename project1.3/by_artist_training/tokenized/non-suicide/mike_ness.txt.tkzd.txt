california ( hustle and flow )

running around like you 're front page news , lonely eyes and your motorcycle boots .
tattooed heart and your jet-black hair , running round like you do n't care .
take me down , take me on down the line .
well , i was born , babe , with nothing to lose , but the black man taught me how to sing the blues .
made a little life outta rock and roll and that crazy california hustle and flow .
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
i went too fast with that rhythm and booze almost ended up dead like all those other fools .
everyone 's got some sort of ball and chain .
what 's life without a little pain ?
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
living in a hollywood movie dream , and i 'm still reaching for the stars .
life gets hard and then it gets good .
like i always knew it would .
running around like you 're front page news , lonely eyes and your motorcycle boots .
tattooed heart and your jet-black hair , running round like you do n't care .
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
take me down , take me on down the line .
shake me down , shake me on down the line .


#gimmie the sweet and lowdown

it was a moonlight mishap , you lost your party hat .
seems your lifestyle be not so worthwhile after all .
a heavy-hearted taxi ride then a walk on the wild side .
did your guardian angel let you down ?
going to lay low and play it straight .
it 's time to rejuvenate .
going to kick start your heart until you come around .
i can tell you now : you 've really gotten the blues .
i can tell you now that i 've walked in your shoes .
gimme the sweet and lowdown .
you better get outta the way .
it 's history made the hard way .
from a hero to a zero once again .
aing . no time for vanity or this insanity .
you 're maladjusted , and now you 're busted once again .
i can tell you now it comes as no surprise .
i can tell you now by that look in your eyes .
gimme the sweet and lowdown .
you 're looking kinda punch drunk because that 's the way you strut your stuff , with a swing and a swagger down the road you go .
you should 've made a better choice and listened to your inner voice .
you got to get right or get left , do n't ya know .
i can tell you now : it 's the peak of bad news .
i can tell you now that i 've walked in your shoes .
gimme the sweet and lowdown , the sweet and lowdown , gimme the sweet - the sweet and lowdown .


#diamond in the rough

well , i 've been up , yeah , and i 've been down .
been kicked around , yeah , this god-forsaken town .
so many faults , so little time , i 've got to find my piece of mind , peace of mind .
i was looking for something , anything at all .
something to believe in spray-painted on the walls .
i 've made mistakes , yeah , i 've paid for them too .
what 's a poor boy supposed to do ?
then she said , yea , you 're like a diamond in the rough .
you 're dirty and you 're damaged , all you need 's a little love .
but inside there 's a sparkle that 'll light the stars above .
and you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
there was a time when i could not say i got a reason to live another day .
a discarded treasure , they all passed on by and i can understand the reasons why .
then she said , yea , you 're like a diamond in the rough .
you 're dirty and you 're damaged , all you need 's a little love .
but inside there 's a sparkle that 'll light the stars above .
you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
then she said , yeah , you 're like a diamond in the rough .
you 're dirty and you 're damaged , all you need 's a little love .
but inside there 's a sparkle that 'll light the stars above .
and you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
yea , yea , diamond in the rough .
yea , yea , going to light the stars above .
yea , yea , all you need 's a little love .
you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
diamond in the rough now .
yea , yea who 'll light the stars above now .
yea , yea all you need 's a little love now , yea , yea , yea , yea .


#bakersfield

take me down that line , going to tow that heavy load .
i ca n't seem to make it , make it on my own .
turn the lights down low now .
turn down our bed .
i ca n't seem to get you out of my head .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're so close yet so far , far away .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're a million miles away , yeah .
i feel the heat coming down now .
sweat runs down my face .
i can hardly make it go , make it through this day .
was it something that i said , or something i did n't do .
eighteen more hours , girl , 'til i 'm home to you .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're so close yet so far , far away .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're a million miles away , yeah .
so i walk out that lonely truck stop with my head hanging down wondering how in the hell i got myself into this mess , and more importantly how i was going to get myself out of it .
so i wrote a song for you , baby girl .
and i hope when i return home , the locks be not changed on the doors and there 's still a spot for me on that big ol ' california king size bed .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're so close yet so far , far away .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're a million miles away , yeah .
wo n't you come see me in bakersfield ?
ooh , i 'm not a million miles away , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .


#writing on the wall

there was a time when you were proud .
you looked up to me with big eyes , and i could do no wrong .
there 's something inside , that 's clearly tearing both of us apart , ooh ooh there 's something inside .
i wonder where you are tonight , and what you did with your day .
ca n't find the words to say .
did you feel the sun ?
did you feel the warmness of my heart ?
ooh ooh did you feel at all ?
they say if you love someone , you got to let them go .
and if they return to you , that 's surely how you 'll know .
ooh ooh , i can read the writing on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go .
they say if you love someone , you got to let them go .
and if they return to you , that 's surely how you 'll know .
ooh ooh , i can read the writing on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go .
i 'm hopelessly aware of the good and bad traits we share .
it 's like looking at myself .
and i know that at times i could 've handled things differently , ooh ooh , but know my intentions were well .
they say if you love someone , you got to let them go .
and if they return to you , that 's surely how you 'll know .
ooh ooh , i can read the writing on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .


#ca n't take it with you

i 'll tell you something , baby that 's a fact : never see a hearse , with a luggage rack .
all your money , your hard earned pay , it do n't mean shit , baby , at the end of the end of the day .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
as sure as life , and the light of day , i 'll tell you something , i 've heard them they say : it do n't matter , baby , what your worth , since we all , we all go back to mother earth .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
work all your life , you become a slave .
there be not no spending when you 're in the grave .
even if it 's raining , thousand dollar bills , think of me baby , in your mansion on the hill .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you ( oh yeah ) , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you ...


#still alive

well , i remember when we were young and you said that i was done .
well , i walked the long boulevard my head hanging down .
and the word out on the street i was back up on my feet ;
i was fighting the same old wars had to even up the scores .
and i 'm still alive , and i will survive .
i can take what life 's got to give just need a little time .
and i 'm still alive , talking that some ol ' jive .
i can handle what comes my way , just gimme another day .
and the times have changed my friend .
i 'll be here to the bitter end .
with a guitar in my hand , i stand a little taller .
and i 've been to hell and back ,
i be not falling off this track .
from the back to the front page , from the gutter to the stage .
and i 'm still alive and i will survive .
i can take what life 's got to give just need a little time .
and i 'm still alive , talking that some ol ' jive .
i can handle what comes my way just gimme another day .
and from town to town i roam , take me so very far from home .
and i woke up one summer day and i fell in love .
and the times have changed , my friend .
i 'll be here to the bitter end .
and i 'm here to make my stand .
with a guitar in my hand .
and i 'm still alive and i will survive .
i can take what life 's got to give just need a little time .
and i 'm still alive , talking that some ol ' jive .
i can handle what comes my way just gimme another day , another day .

#reach for the sky

when i was young i was invincible .
i found myself not thinking twice .
i never thought about no future , it 's just a roll of the dice .
but the day may come when you got something to lose , and just when you think you 're done paying dues , you say to yourself : "dear , god what have i done ? " and hope its not too late , cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
yesterday is history , and tomorrow is a mystery .
but baby right now , it 's just about you and me .
you can run , you can hide , just like bonnie and clyde .
reach for the sky be not never going to die .
and i thank the lord for the love that i have found , and hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
so if you please take this moment , try if you can to make it last .
do n't think about no future , and just forget about the past .
and make it last .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky i be not never going down .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky i be not never coming down .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
reach for the sky i be not never going down .
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .


#highway 101

take a drive baby up the coast , yea highway 101 .
i 'll pass ventura and santa barbara too , just as fast as my motor runs .
gotta pocket full of memories , some happy and some are sad .
gotta girl standing by my side through the good times and the bad .
listen to the boulevard , listen to the falling rain .
i believe in love now , with all of its joys and pains .
sick boy , sick girl , looking nice dressed up on a saturday night .
take a walk downtown for a while and chase the pale moonlight .
i can still hear the mission bells and the train rolling through your town .
going to leave this world behind , we 're southern california bound .
listen to the boulevard , listen to the falling rain .
i believe in love now , with all of its joys and pains .
listen to the boulevard , listen to the falling rain .
i believe in love now , with all of its joys and pains .
follow the palm trees under the california sun .
i believe in love now , i believe in love again .


#do n't take me for granted

i 'm your worn in leather jacket .
i 'm the volume in your fucked up teenage band .
a bag of smokes and a six pack , i 'm the dreams you had walkin down the railroad tracks , you and me .
i 'm your first taste of romance .
i 'm your first broken heart on a saturday night .
guys like us be not got no chance , but i 'm the thing that keeps you and me alive , but not forever .
so take me down the road .
take me to the show .
it 's something to believe in that no one else knows .
but do n't take me for granted .
i 'm the blood on your guitar .
i 'm that wave you caught back in 1975 .
i 'm as strong as a thousand armies .
i 'm as soft as a pedal on a long stem rose .
i am love .
so take me down the road .
take me to the show .
it 's something to believe in that no one else knows .
but do n't take me for granted .
i 'm with you when you 're born .
you can take me when you die
with all the reasons why .
but do n't take me for granted .
no one knows .
do n't take me for granted .


#footprints on my ceiling

everybody wants a lover , nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past .
long ago , without a care , pull gardenias from her hair .
i think of a time we did n't have a care in the world .
captivated by her beauty , i knew it was my life long duty .
she had all the grace and charm of a radiant queen .
how do you talk without speaking ?
how do you hear without listening ?
how do you live without feeling ?
how do you take without giving ?
and keep it all inside ?
there are footprints on my ceiling .
i ca n't help this fucked up feeling .
something 's wrong , you be not coming round here no more .
try to get my thoughts together , i think of a time when things were better this miscommunication is breaking me down .
how do you talk without speaking ?
how do you hear without listening ?
how do you live without feeling ?
how do you take without giving ?
how you treat your new best friend ?
everybody wants a lover .
nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past .
my heart is heavy , slowly sinking .
i redirect my desperate thinking , and kiss her red full lips like i did the very first time .
how do you talk without speaking ?
how do you hear without listening ?
how do you live without feeling ?
how do you take without giving ?
there are footprints on my ceiling .
and i kept it bottled up inside all my life .


#nickels and dimes

i 'm a cadillac tramp at the end of his road .

i 'm a penthouse pauper with nothing to lose .

yeah , yeah , yeah , i 'm chasing nickles and dimes .
the rest of the world passes me by .

i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
yeah .
i 'm a loaded gun that pointed at the mirror .
a drugstore cowboy whose end is near , yeah baby .
i 'm a big time schemer with broken down dreams .
i 'm a derelict rebel without a cause .
i be not the cat with the sharpest claws , no baby .
cause sometimes life just be not what it seems .
yeah , yeah , yeah , i 'm chasing nickles and dimes .
the rest of the world passes me by .
nah , nah , nah , im just wasting my time .
i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
and just like you , i 'm wondering why .


#i was n't born to follow

when i grow up , going to be a star .
going to sing my songs and play my guitar , i 'm ready .
going to change the world , going to turn the page , going to say what i feel , let out this rage , get ready .
we 're going down , down to the streets below .
going to sing the songs of the streets again .
going to knock me off my feet , so get ready .
i 'll sing a song for the fallen angels .
this one goes to all the unsung heroes .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause do n't you know , i was n't born to follow .
i realize that in your eyes you got ideas but i got mine , get ready .
here comes the new generation .
hope they feel and fight the same way as we did .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause i was n't born , i was n't born to follow , no .
when i grow up , going to be a star .
going to sing my songs and play my guitar , i 'm ready .
going to change the world , going to turn the page , going to say what i feel , let out this rage , get ready .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause do n't you know , i was n't born to follow .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause do n't you know , i was n't born to follow .
we 're going down , down , down , down .
we 're going down , down , down , down .
i said goodbye to the masses .
i was n't born to follow .


#winners and losers

winners and losers , turn the pages of my life .
we 're beggars and choosers , with all the struggles and the strife .
i got no reason to turn my head and look the other way .
we 're good and we 're evil .
which one will i be today ?
there 's saints and sinners .
life 's a gamble and you might lose .
there 's cowards and heroes , both have been known now to break the rules .
there 's lovers and haters .
the strong and the weak will all have their day .
we 're devils and angels .
which one will i be today ?
are you happy now with all the choices you 've made ?
are there times in life when you know you should have stayed ?
will you compromise then realize the price is too much to pay ?
winners and losers , which one will you be today ?
there 's a light and a dark side .
standing at the crossroads , there we 'll meet .
there 's prophets and fools there .
the lies and the truth , will be at our feet .
i got a reason to turn my head and look the other way .
it 's heaven and hell here .
which one will i live today ?
are you happy now with all the choices you 've made ?
are there times in life when you know you should have stayed ?
did you compromise then realize the price was too much to pay ?
winners and losers , which one will you be today ?
which one will you be today ?
which one will i be today ?


#faithless

i know a girl who warns of the dangers of love , all the pain and the anguish , the sorrow that it brings .
she keeps herself in a world that 's protected .
her outsides are tough , but inside her heart longs to sing .
do n't let your walls down , you might fall in love , you might fall in love .
he 's going to get his girlfriend 's name tattooed on his neck and hope he never , never lives to regret .
he 's going to walk down that long , dark alley and what he finds there you know he 'll never forget .
do n't let your walls down , you might fall in love , you might fall in love .
they 're crashing down now .
you might fall in love .
i remember a time i believed that the words love and pain were both one in the same .
i 'm going to trade in my old ways for a new shot at life .
i 'm going to change , change my direction .
i 'm going to change my ways .
do n't let your walls down , you might fall in love , you might fall in love .
they 're crashing down now .
it 's you i 'm thinking of , it 's you i 'm thinking of .
let 's fall in love .


#live before you die

when pressures up , and the stress is high , and i want to bid this world good bye , i 'm going to bury my frustrations , grab some of life 's satisfactions , yeah , i 'm going to live before i die .
i try to find some peace of mind when my life 's treating me unkind .
pain will be my motivation .
i 'm going to use my imagination .
yeah , i 'm going to live before i die .
so close your eyes , and embrace your memories .
leave your troubles and your worries far behind .
stop contemplating and start celebrating .
yeah , you got to live before you die .
i think of chances i did n't take .
i try to learn from my mistakes , yeah .
i 'm tired of being pushed around now .
life be not going to drag me down now .
yeah , i 'm going to live before i die .
so close your eyes , and embrace your memories .
leave your troubles and your worries far behind .
stop contemplating and start celebrating .
yeah , you got to live before you die .


#angel 's wings

you say you 're down on your luck .
hey baby , it 's a long , long way up .
hold back now , hold back your fears .
you say you 're really down and out , and you feel like there 's no way out now .
let go now , let go of your tears some more .
how many times have you asked yourself : is this the hand of fate now that i 've been dealt ?
you 're so disillusioned , this ca n't be real , and you ca n't stand now the way you feel .
i do n't care about what they say .
i wo n't live or die that way .
tired of figuring out things on my own .
angel 's wings , wo n't you carry me home .
and when you 're down on your luck , hey baby , it 's a long , long way up .
hold back now , hold back your fears .
and when you 're really down and out , and you feel like there 's no way out now .
let go now , let go of your tears some more .
and when you 're down on your luck , hey baby , it 's a long , long way up .
hold back now , hold back your fears .
and when you 're really down and out , and you feel like there 's no way out now .
let go now , let go of your tears some more .
i triumphed in the face of adversity , and i became the man i never thought i 'd be .
and now my biggest challenge , a thing called love .
i guess i 'm not as tough as i thought i was .
i do n't care about what they say , i 'm going to marry you some day .
go ahead and wake up , it 's a brand new day .
angel 's wings going to carry you away .
angel 's wings going to carry me away .
angel 's wings going to carry us away , going to carry us away , going to carry us away , going to carry us away .

#so far away

i 've sung the blues , for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you .
i 've paid my dues , working hard-sweat , blood , and tears for you .
so far away , so far away , so far away !
so far away , so far away , so far away !
i 've had it all , and lost it all in one blackout summer night .
i want it back , but i just ca n't seem to get it right .
so far away , so far away , so far away !
so far away , so far away , so far away !
i 've sung the blues , for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you .
i 've paid my dues , working hard-sweat , blood and tears for you .
so far away , so far away , so far away !
so far away , so far away , so far away !


#let it be me

i 've been in love , but now i 'm waiting .
do n't ever want to worry about a thing .
i sit at home and i wonder : will i rise or will i go under .
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely .
let it be me , let it be me , your one and only .
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you .
let it be me , if your feeling blue .
i 've seen you aroud , but you do n't know me .
i 've watched your life , but ca n't always see .
i 'll try and i 'll try girl to love you .
and when we die , you will have loved too .
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely .
let it be me , let it be me , your one and only .
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you .
let it be me , if your feeling blue .
you know your friends talk bad about me .
your folks say it 's not suppose to be .
you know girl your life is going by fast , try to make it last .
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely .
let it be me , let it be me , your one and only .
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you .
let it be me , if your feeling blue .


#story of my life

high school seemed like such a blur .
i did n't have much interest in sports or school elections , and in class , i dreamed all day , of a rock 'n' roll weekend .
and the girl in the front of the room , so close yet so far you know she never seemed to notice that this silly schoolboy crush was n't just pretend .
life goes by so fast .
you only want to do what you think is right .
close your eyes and then it 's past .
story of my life .
and i went down my old neighborhood .
the faces have all changed ; there 's no one left to talk to , and the pool hall i loved as a kid is now a seven eleven .
i went downtown to look for a job .
i had no training , no experience to speak of .
and i looked at the holes in my jeans , and turned and headed back .
life goes by so fast .
you only want to do what you think is right .
close your eyes and then it 's past .
story of my life .
good times come , and good times go .
i only wish the good times would last a little longer .
and i think about the good times we had and why they had to end .
so i sit at the edge of my bed .
i strum my guitar and i sing an outlaw love song .
thinking 'bout what you 're doing now , and when you 're coming back .
life goes by so fast .
you only want to do what you think is right .
close your eyes and then it 's past .
story of my life .

#ball and chain

well it 's been ten years and a thousand tears , and look at the mess i 'm in .
a broken nose and a broken heart , an empty bottle of gin .
well i sit and i pray in my broken down chevrolet .
while i 'm singing to myself , there 's got to be another way .
take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .
well i 'm lonely and i 'm tired , and i ca n't take any more pain .
take away , take away , never to return again .
take away , take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .
well i 've searched and i 've searched to find the perfect life .
a brand new car and a brand new suit , i even got me a little wife .
but wherever i have gone i was sure to find myself there .
you can run all your life , but not go anywhere .
take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .
well i 'm lonely and i 'm tired , and i ca n't take any more pain .
take away , take away , never to return again .
take away , take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .
well i 'll pass the bar on the way to my dingy hotel room .
i spent all my money , i 've been drinking since half past noon .
well i 'll wake there in the morning , or maybe in the county jail .
times are hard , getting harder ,
i 'm born to lose and destined to fail .
take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .
well i 'm lonely and i 'm tired , and i ca n't take any more pain .
take away , take away , never to return again .
take away , take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .


#it could 've been me

i got friends who are in prison , friends who are dead .
i 'm going to tell ya something that i 've often said .
you know these things that happen , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it could 've been me .
i had me a good girl , her kisses sweeter than wine .
and i had always hoped that someday i 'd make her mine .
but she ran off and married , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it could 've been me .
well the junkie cops on first street , sticks a needle in his arm .
no , he never meant to do anyone no harm .
but he 's buried six feet deep , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't ya know it could 've been me .
i had me a good girl , her kisses sweeter than wine .
and i had always hoped that someday i 'd make her mine .
bus she ran off and married , that 's just the way it 's supposed to be .
and i ca n't help but wonder , do n't you know it could 've been me .
could 've been me , could 've been me , could been me , could 've been me , could 've been me ,
could 've been me , could 've been me , could 've been me .
could 've been , should 've been me .


#she 's a knockout

everywhere she goes , people turn their heads , she 's a knockout .
everyone wishes she was sleeping in their beds , she 's a knockout .
when guys see her coming they start spending their money , she 's a knockout .
but do n't you know i 'm the only one who can call her honey , she 's a knockout .
she 's a knockout , she 's a knockout , she 's a knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , she 's a knockout .
she 's exotic but not foreign , built like an old cadillac , she 's a knockout .
once she 's left your life she be not never coming back , she 's a knockout .
with her black silk stockings and her high-heeled shoes , she 's a knockout .
once she 's left your life , you 'll surely sing the blues , she 's a knockout .
he 's a knockout , she 's a knockout , she 's a knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , she 's a knockout .
some friends were telling me , just the other day ,
they walk right up to her , they do n't know what to say .
and when she calls me , hear a ring on the telephone ,
i 'll be there waiting for her , sitting at home all alone , all alone .
in the nightclubs baby when the lights shine down , she 's a knockout .
if the feeling be not right she do n't even come around , she 's a knockout .
when she walks down the aisle ya know her hips begin to sway , she 's a knockout .
come on little baby i 'll show you the way , she 's a knockout .
she 's a knockout , she 's a knockout , she 's a knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , she 's a knockout .


# a place in my heart

i saw her today , oh god i miss her smile .
a pleasant memory of things in life worthwhile , the things worthwhile .
we used to walk , and we used to talk .
we used to laugh , and we used to cry .
and there will always be a place in my heart for her .
i thought of her today , of years together spent .
a pleasant memory of places that we went , the places we went .
we used to walk , and we used to talk .
we used to laugh , and we used to cry .
and there will always be a place in my heart for her .


#drug train

it 'll take you as high as the heavens .
it 'll take you to the depths of hell .
it 'll make you friends , it 'll take your friends who will never live to tell .
drug train , drug train .
drug train , drug train .
the traing . first stop is pleasure .
the scond stop is fun .
but in a jail cell , baby , in a hospital bed , you 'll need hope , because you
be not got none .
drug train , drug train .
drug train , drug train .
the train passes through the graveyard .
may the loved ones rest in peace .
for the last stop baby is a violent crash and hard times they never cease .
drug train , drug train .
drug train , drug train .

#cold feelings

uninvited feelings , they come without warning and they stay too long .
i do n't want to feel , and if i run they 'll be just as strong .
i 've been a-waiting , i 'm waiting for some kind of sign .
i try to separate , try to separate my body from my mind .
i watch the clock as the second hand slowly goes strolling by .
i do n't want to feel , when a loved one 's time 's come to die .
i 've been a-waiting , i 'm waiting for some kind of a sign .
i try to separate , try to separate my body from my mind .
cold feelings in the night .
you know , this feeling just be not right .
and though i try i just ca n't hide .
cold feelings in the night .
look out !
yeah i got faith , but sometimes fear it just weighs too much .
i do n't want to feel , cold winds blowing through me like an empty touch .
i 've been a-waiting , i 'm waiting for some kind of sign .
i try to separate , try to separate my body from my mind .
cold feelings in the night .
you know , this feeling just be not right .
and though i try i just ca n't hide .
cold feelings in the night .
cold feelings in the night .
cold feelings in the night .
cold feelings in the night .


#bad luck

some people like to gamble , but you , you always lose .
some people like to rock 'n' roll ; you 're always singing the blues .
you got to nasty disposition , no one really knows the reason why .
you got to bad , bad reputation .
going to hang your head down and cry .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
thirteen 's my lucky number , to you it means stay inside .
black cat done crossed my path , no reason to run and hide .
you 're looking through a cracked mirror , no one really knows the reason why .
your enemies are getting nearer .
going to hang down your head and cry .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
some people go to church on sundays , others they pray at home .
you tell them that there be not no god , that they 're better off standing alone .
you 're always scratching at the eight ball , no one really knows the reason why .
you get to the top and then you fall .
going to hang down your head and cry .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .
do n't give it to me .
you got bad , bad luck .
bad , bad luck .


#born to lose

i was brought in this world 1962 , i did n't have much choice you see .
but by the time i was eight , i could tell it was too late , i was already barking up the wrong tree .
when i was in school , you thought i was a fool , in trouble , breaking all the rules .
i was absent from class , my daddy spanked my bare ass , but i sure tried hard to be cool .
born to lose , was what they said , you know i was better off dead .
born to lose , you 're just bad news , you do n't get a second chance .
it was a hot summer night in mid july , a hangover and a black eye .
your momma said i was a loser , a dead end cruiser , and deep inside i know that she was right .
born to lose , was what they said , you know i was better off dead .
born to lose , you 're just bad news , you do n't get a second chance .
i tried to get myself a job because that 's the way that things are , want to have nice things and go far .
well i 'm sorry honey , i be not got much money , but i can sure play this here old
guitar .
as the years went on , i made a few mistakes it was a troublebound for this young man .
the police knocking at my door , " well he do n't live here no more , and he 's playing in a rock 'n' roll band . "
born to lose , was what they said , you know i was better off dead .
born to lose , you 're just bad news , you do n't get a second chance .


# when she begins

i was feeling kinda beat , i decided to hit the streets .
i was looking for a place for this heart of mine .
well i said to myself , oh god this must be hell .
i think i was slowly losing my mind .
well round and round she goes where she 'll stop nobody knows .
y 'know that woman put a spell on me .
but if you start me , start me , start me , you ca n't stop me , stop me , stop me .
when she begins to rock , honey , i begin to roll .
i was hanging by the phone , tired of sleeping alone .
baby tell me where did i go wrong ?
when minutes seem like hours and days seem like weeks , how could a year last so fucking long ?
well round and round she goes where she 'll stop nobody knows .
y 'know that woman put a spell on me .
but if you start me , start me , start me , you ca n't stop me , stop me , stop me .
when she begins to rock , honey , i begin to roll .
i was hanging with a couple of chicks , man i was just looking for kicks .
i was looking for a place for this raggedy ol ' heart of mine .
well i said to myself , oh god this must be hell .
i think i was slowly losing my mind .
well round and round she goes where she 'll stop nobody knows .
y 'know that woman put a spell on me .
but if you start me , start me , start me , you ca n't stop me , stop me , stop me .
when she begins to rock , honey , i begin to roll .


#99 to life

i 'm broken hearted , i 'm a broken man .
driven by anger , on that night i ran .
i had me a woman .
i thought that she 'd be true .
now she 's gone and left me , you know her life is through .
lonely weekends , baby lonely nights .
the judge he gave me , ninety nine to life .
i wish she could be here , lord if she only could .
instead she 's laying in a puddle of blood .
she was my baby , thought she 'd be my wife .
i killed my baby , i killed her with my knife .
lonely weekends , baby lonely nights .
the judge he gave me , ninety nine to life .
so alone i 'm sitting in my prison cell lord only knows now , i 'm in a living hell .
the rest of my life , in this penitentiary , the good lord above now , please have mercy on me .
lonely weekends , baby lonely nights .
the judge he gave me , ninety nine to life .


#king of fools

i was born a king of fools .
most people think i 'm just a playboy breaking rules .
but they do n't know that when it comes around to love , i always lose .
that 's why i call myself the king of fools .
i was born never to care , but now i want to love that i can share .
i 've searched in vain for a love that would never be true .
that 's why i call myself the king of fools .
king of fools , king of fools , when it comes around your love , i always lose .
i was born without one good thought .
just to live fast , tell a lie and break a heart .
i have broken many hearts and i 've broken many rules .
that 's why i call myself the king of fools .
i was born the king of fools .
at any other game i never lose .
but when it comes around to love , that 's when i realize : i was born the king of fools .
king of fools , king of fools , at any other game i never lose .
king of fools , king of fools , when it comes around your love , i always lose .

your scratches run across my back and then a tear .
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more .
dear lover , i pick my heart up from the floor .
dear lover , i ca n't believe it 's come to this .
dear lover , give me one last painful kiss .

#do n't drag me down

children are taught to hate .
parents just could n't wait .
some are rich and some are poor .
others will just suffer more .
have you ever been ashamed and felt society try to keep you down ?
i begin to watch things change and see them turn around .
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down .
turn around , turn around , do n't drag me down .
ignorance like a gun in hand .
reach out to the promised land .
your history books are full of lies .
media-blitz going to dry your eyes .
have you ever been afraid and felt society try to keep you down ?
i begin to watch things change and see them turn around .
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down .
turn around , turn around , do n't drag me down .
ignorance like a gun in hand .
reach out to the promised land .
your history books are full of lies .
media-blitz going to dry your eyes .
you 're eighteen , want to be a man .
your granddaddy 's in the ku klux klan , taking two steps forward and four steps back .
going to go to the white house and paint it black .
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down .
turn around , turn around , they 'll try to keep you down ,
turn around , do n't drag me down .


#i was wrong

oh , when i was young i was so full of fear .
i hid behind anger , held back the tears .
it was me against the world .
i was sure that i 'd win , but the world fought back , punished me for my sins .
i felt so alone , so insecure .
i blamed you instead , made sure i was heard , and they tried to warn me of my evil ways but i would n't hear what they had to say .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
i realize now that i was wrong .
and i think about my loves , well , i 've had a few .
well , i 'm sorry that i hurt them .
did i hurt you too ?
i took what i wanted , put my heart on the shelf , but how can you love me when you do n't love yourself ?
it was me against the world .
i was sure that i 'd win .
the world fought back , punished me for my sins and they tried to warn me of my evil ways , but i could n't hear what they had to say .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
i realize now that i was wrong .
i was wrong , yeah , i was wrong .
i grew up fast , and i grew up hard .
something was wrong from the very start .
i was fighting everybody , i was fighting everything , but the only one that i hurt was me .
i got society 's blood running down my face .
somebody help me get outta this place .
how could someone 's bad luck last so long ?
until i realized that i was wrong .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
i realize now that i was wrong .
i was wrong .
self destruction 's got me again .
i was wrong .
the only moment that i was me , i was wrong .


#through these eyes

through these eyes i 've seen love and i 've seen hate .
i 've seen the violence and the tears through these eyes .
i got my schooling on the streets .
i 've seen the things in life you do n't want to see .
through these eyes , i 've seen the shape of things to come , and i 've watched them all fall apart , through these eyes .
i 've seen the broken homes , they cry .
i 've seen the poor man 's face as he stands in line .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on .
through these eyes , i 've looked the devil in the face and i 've seen god 's holy grace , through these eyes .
i 've tried to walk the straighter line .
i found myself again but nearly lost my mind .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on , yeah .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on .
and though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on .
through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on .


#down on the world again

i 'm feeling like a loaded gun .
there 's a world of guilt written on my face , and i feel ashamed for the human race .
i 've been forsaken , and i 'm down on the world again .
well , i feel so alone in this crowd .
my thoughts of despair are getting loud .
i 'm disrespected and i 'm down on the world again .
love and tolerance have abandoned me , and i feel the gloom hovering over me .
i 'm resentful , and i 'm down on the world again .
give me tomorrow 's broken dreams now .
i 'm feeling like a loaded gun .
give me tomorrow 's holy schemes now , so hopeless when there 's no place left to run .
well , i tried to play for the higher stakes .
you wo n't let me forget my mistakes .
i 'm unforgiven , and i 'm down on the world again .
this be not the way it 's supposed to be .
there 's a dark cloud following me .
i 'm distorted , and i 'm down on the world again .

# when angels sing

at last we meet again , dear god , hear the angels sing .
the funerals are nicer when we know you 're there , when the angels sing .
sometimes i try so hard to understand the things you do .
i like to question you when it all comes down , hear the angels sing .
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angels sing .
love and death do n't mean a thing till the angels sing .
the prisoners pray when they 're on to death row , when the angels sing .
the junky cries for love but it 's all run out , when the angels sing .
the sins of the world .
and it 's cold on the streets and you 're all alone and the tears they start to fall when it all comes down , hear the angels sing .
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angels sing .
love and death do n't mean a thing , till the angels sing .
little by little , day by day , i watch the children play .
cause life and death do n't mean a thing , till the angels sing .
when the angel of death comes to looking for me , hear the angels sing .
i hope i was everything i was supposed to be , when the angels sing .
there 's got to be a heaven cause i 've already done my time in hell .
and a little , baby 's born , when it all comes down , hear the angels sing .
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angels sing .
love and death do n't mean a thing , till the angels sing .
little by little , day by day , i watch the children play because life and death do n't mean a thing till the angels sing .
