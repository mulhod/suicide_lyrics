#jesusland take a walk . 
out the gate you go and never stop , past dollar store and wig shop , quarter in a cup for every block . 
and watch the building grow small as you go down the track , beautiful mcmansions on a hill this . 
overlook a highway with riverboat casino and you still have yet to see a soul . 
jesusland , jesusland . 
town to town , broadcast to each house , they drop you name , but no one know you face . 
billboard quote thing you 'd never say . 
you hang you head and pray for jesusland , jesusland . 
mile and mile , and the sun go down . 
pulse glow from they home . 
you 're not alone . 
light come on as you lie you weary head on they lawn . 
park lot , crack and grow grass . 
you see it all from office to farm . 
cross fly high above the mall . 
a long walk through jesusland , jesusland .

#sentimental guy there 's a moment in me mind i scribble and erase a thousand time like a letter never write or send . 
this conversation with the dead . 
i use to be a sentimental guy . 
now i 'm haunt by the leave unsay . 
i never think so much can change . 
little thing you say or do be part of me , come out from time to time . 
probably no one i know now will notice . 
but i never think so much can change . 
you drift far away , far away it seem . 
time have stop , the clock keep go . 
people talk and i 'm watch as flash of they face go black and white and fade to yellow in a box in an attic . 
but i never think so much can change . 
now i do n't miss anyone . 
i do n't miss anything . 
what a shame because i use to be a sentimental guy . 
#time think of me any way you want . 
i can be the problem if this 's easy . 
in you head , move the piece around , thing i 've say . 
turn the memory upside down and it make it well , i know , but sometime it 's hard to swallow . 
in time , i will fade away . 
in time , i wo n't hear what you 're say . 
in time , but time take time , you know . 
tell you friend the thing they want to hear and see . 
start the drum . 
band against the enemy and in time i will fade away . 
in time , i wo n't care what you 're say . 
in time , but time take time , you know . 
in you head , move the piece around , thing i 've say . 
turn the memory upside down . 
it may make it well , i know , but sometime it 's hard to swallow . 
in time , i will fade away . 
in time , i wo n't care what you 're say . 
in time , but time take time , you know . 
time take time you know . 
#prison food you walk the earth , talk and never speak a word . 
he wonder who will be the first to go . 
i say you know , the big thing we get to face alone . 
do n't want to waste time and go . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
a trace of me , it float in me periphery and , every time i turn to see , it go . 
alone alone again lone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
float by like a satellite to pass the time , you 'll float by again and i can tell you about the little . 
thing so you do n't think about the big thing for a while . 
you walk the earth , talk and never speak a word . 
he wonder who will be the first to go . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again alone .
