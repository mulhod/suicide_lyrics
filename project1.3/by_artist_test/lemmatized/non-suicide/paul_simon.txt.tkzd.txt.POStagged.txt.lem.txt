the sound of silence hello darkness , me old friend . 
i 've come to talk with you again because a vision softly creep , leave it seed while i be sleep . 
and the vision this be plant in me brain still remain within the sound of silence . 
in restless dream i walk alone , narrow street of cobblestone . 
beneath the halo of a street lamp , i turn me collar to the cold and damp . 
when me eye be stab by the flash of a neon light this split the night and touch the sound of silence . 
and in the naked light , i see ten thousand people , maybe more . 
people talk without speak , people hear without listen , people write song this voice never share . 
and no one dare disturb the sound of silence . 
"fools " say i ,"you do not know silence like a cancer grow . 
hear me word this i may teach you . 
take me arm this i may reach you " . 
but me word like silent raindrop fall and echo in the well of silence . 
and the people bow and pray to the neon god they make . 
and the sign flash out it warn in the word this it be form . 
and the sign say , 'the word of the prophet be write on the subway wall and tenement hall and whisper 'd in the sound of silence . 
#leaves this be green i be twenty-one year when i write this song . 
i 'm twenty-two now but i wo n't be for long . 
time hurry on . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
once me heart be fill with the love of a girl . 
i hold he close , but he fade in the night like a poem i mean to write . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
i throw a pebble in a brook . 
and watch the ripple run away . 
and they never make a sound . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
hello , hello , hello , hello . 
good-bye , good-bye , good-bye , good-bye . 
this 's all there be . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
#blessed bless be the meek for they shall inherit . 
bless be the lamb who blood flow . 
bless be the sit upon , spit upon , rat on . 
o lord , why have you forsake me ? 
i get no place to go . 
i 've walk around soho for the last night or so , ah , but it do n't matter , no . 
bless be the land and the kingdom . 
bless be the man who soul belong to . 
bless be the meth drinker , pot seller , illusion dweller . 
o lord , why have you forsake me ? 
me word trickle down , from a wind this i have no intention to heal . 
bless be the stain glass , window pane glass . 
bless be the church service , make me nervous . 
bless be the penny rookers , cheap hooker , groovy looker . 
o lord , why have you forsake me ? 
i have tend me own garden much too long . 
#kathy 's song i hear the drizzle of the rain . 
like a memory it fall , soft and warm continuing , tap on me roof and wall . 
and from the shelter of me mind through the window of me eye , i gaze beyond the rain-drenched street to england where me heart lie . 
me mind 's distract and diffuse . 
me thought be many mile away . 
they lie with you when you 're asleep and kiss you when you start you day . 
and as a song i be write be leave undo , i do n't know why i spend me time write song i ca n't believe with word this tear and strain to rhyme . 
and so you see i have come to doubt all this i once hold as true . 
i stand alone without belief . 
the only truth i know be you . 
and as i watch the drop of rain weave they weary path and die . 
i know this i be like the rain . 
there but for the grace of you go i . 
#somewhere they ca n't find me i can hear the soft breathe of the girl this i love as he lie here beside me , asleep with the night . 
he hair in a fine mist float on me pillow , reflect the glow of the winter moonlight . 
but i 've get to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway . 
before they come to catch me , i 'll be go somewhere they ca n't find me . 
oh baby , you do n't know what i 've do . 
i 've commit a crime , i 've break the law . 
while you be here sleep and just dream of me , i hold up and rob a liquor store . 
but i 've get to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway . 
before they come to catch me , i 'll be go somewhere they ca n't find me . 
oh me life seem unreal , me crime an illusion , a scene badly write in which i must play . 
and though it put me uptight to leave you , i know it 's not right to leave you when morning be just a few hour away . 
but i 've get to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway . 
before they come to catch me , i 'll be go somewhere they ca n't find me .

#i be a rock a winter 's day in a deep and dark december , i be alone , gaze from me window to the street below on a freshly fall silent shroud of snow . 
i be a rock . 
i be an island . 
i 've build wall , a fortress deep and mighty , this none may penetrate . 
i have no need of friendship ; friendship cause pain . 
it 's laughter and it 's love i disdain . 
i be a rock . 
i be an island . 
do n't talk of love , but i 've hear the word before . 
it 's sleep in me memory . 
i wo n't disturb the slumber of feeling this have die . 
if i never love i never will have cry . 
i be a rock . 
i be an island . 
i have me book and me poetry to protect me . 
i be shield in me armor , hide in me room , safe within me womb . 
i touch no one and no one touch me . 
i be a rock , i be an island . 
and a rock feel no pain . 
and an island never cry .
