In a Station

Once I walked through the halls of a station.
Someone called your name.
In the streets I heard children laughing.
They all sound the same.
Wonder, could you ever know me, know the reason why I live? 
Is there nothing you can show me?
Life seems so little to give.
Once I climbed up the face of a mountain and ate the wild fruit there, fell asleep until the moonlight woke me and I could taste your hair.
Isn't everybody dreaming? 
Then the voice I hear is real.
Out of all the idle scheming, can't we have something to feel? 
Once upon a time they used me indeed.
Tomorrow never comes.
I could sing the sound of your laughter.
Still I don't know your name.
Must be some way to repay you out of all the good you gave.
If a rumour should delay you, love seems so little to say.

#We Can Talk

We can talk about it now.
It's that same old riddle only starting from the middle.
I'd fix it, but I don't know how.
Well, we could try to reason, but you might think it's treason.
One voice for all, echoing along the hall.
Don't give up on father clock.
We can talk about it now.
Come, let me show you how to keep the wheels turning.
you've got to keep the engine churning. 
But did you ever milk a cow?  
I had the chance one day, but I was all dressed up for Sunday.
Everybody, everywhere, do you really care?  
Well, then, pick up your heads and walk.
We can talk about it now.
It seems to me we've been holding something underneath our tongues.
I'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back, it would likely burst your lungs  .
Stop me if I should sound kind of down in the mouth, but I'd rather be burned in Canada than to freeze here in the south.
Moving that eternal plough.
We've got to find a sharper blade or have a new one made.
Rest awhile and cool your brow.
Don't you see there's no need to slave, the whip is in the grave.
No, no trance.
It's safe now to take a backward glance because the flames have turned to chalk.
We can talk about it now.

#Lonesome Suzie

Lonesome Suzie never got the breaks.
She's always losing and so she sits and cries and shakes.
It's hard just to watch her and, if I touch her , oh, poor Suzie, I'm wondering what to do .
She just sits there hoping for a friend  .
I don't fit here, but I may have a friend to lend  .
Maybe I mistook her, but I can't overlook her  .
Must be someone who can pull her through.
Anyone who's felt that bad could tell me what to say . 
Even if she just got mad she might be better off that way .
And where is all the understanding?
Her problems can't be that demanding  .
Why is it she looks my way every time she starts to cry?
Lonesome Suzie, I can't watch you cry no longer , if you can use me until you feel a little stronger  .
I guess just watching you has made me lonesome too  .
Why don't we get together?
what else can we do?

#Katie's Been Gone

Katie's been gone since the spring time.
She wrote one time and sent her love.
Katie's been gone for such a long time now.
I wonder what kind of love she's thinking of.
Dear Katie, if you can hear me, I can't wait to have you near me.
Dear Katie, since you caught that bus, well, I don't know how things are with us.
I'm still here and you're out there.
Katie laughed when I said I was lonely.
She said, "There's no need to feel that way".
Katie said that I was her only one, but then I wonder why she didn't wanna stay.
Dear Katie, if I'm the only one, how much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't you tell me straight, how much longer do I have to wait?
I'll believe you, but please come through.
I know it's wrong to be apart this long.
You should be here, near me.
Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
She's gone to find some newer places, left the old life far behind.
Dear Katie, don't you miss your home?
I don't see why you had to roam.
Dear Katie, since you've been away, I lose a little something every day.
I need you here, but you're still out there.
Dear Katie, please drop me a line.
Just write, love, to tell me you're fine.
Oh, Katie, if you can hear me, I just can't wait to have you near me.
I can only think, where are you, what you do, maybe there's someone new.

#Orange Juice Blues (Blues for Breakfast)

I had a hard time waking this morning.
I got a lotta things on my mind, like those friends of yours.
They keep bringing me down, just hanging around all the time.
I've had a hard time waking most mornings and it's been that way for a month or more.
You've had things your way, but now I've got to say I'm on my way out the door.
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby?
You haven't been right with me.
why don't you get right, try and get right, baby?
don't you remember how it used to be?
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby?
You haven't been right with me.
why don't you get right, try and get right, baby?
don't you remember how it used to be?
You had a hard time waking this morning and I can see it in your empty eyes, but there's no need for talking or walking round the block just to figure out the reason why.
I have a hard time handing out warnings.
I'll just slide on out the door because I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful, and I ain't coming back no more.
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby?
You haven't been right with me.
why don't you get right, try and get right, baby?
don't you remember how it used to be?

#When You Awake

Ollie told me, I'm a fool, so I walked on down the road a mile, went to the house that brings a smile, sat upon my grandpa's knee and what do you think he said to me?
When you awake, you will remember everything.
You will be hanging on a string from your...
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know.
Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right.
Use your days and save your nights.
Careful where you step and watch what you eat.
Sleep with the light and you got it beat.
When you awake, you will remember everything.
You will be hanging on a string from your...
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know.
Ollie warned me, it's mean old world.
The street don't greet you, yes, it's true.
What am I supposed to do?
Read the writing on the wall.
I heard it when I was very small.
When you awake, you will remember everything.
You will be hanging on a string from your...
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know.
Wash my hands in lye water, I got a date with the Captain's daughter.
You can go and tell your brother.
We sure gonna love one another, oh, yeah.
May be right and you might be wrong.
I ain't gonna worry all day long.
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite.
My old car froze up last night.
Ain't no reason to hang my head.
I could wake up in the morning dead.
If I thought it would do any good, I'd stand on the rock where Moses...

#Whispering Pines

If you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream, here inside my lonely room there is no in between.
If you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream, inside my lonely room there is no in between.
Whispering pines, rising of the tide.
If only one star shines, that's just enough to get inside.
I will wait until it all goes around.
With you in sight the lost are found.
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea.
Protect my only light for she once belonged to me.
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry for, if I live again, these hopes will never die.
I can feel you standing there, but I don't see you anywhere.
Standing by the well, standing by the well, wishing for the rains, wishing for the rains, reaching to the clouds, reaching to the clouds for nothing else remains.
Drifting in a daze when evening will be done, try looking through a haze at an empty house in the cold, cold sun.
I will wait until it all goes around.
With you in sight the lost are found.

#Jawbone

Oh, Jawbone, when did you first go wrong?
Oh, Jawbone, where is it you belong?
Three time loser, you'll never learn, lay down your tools before you burn.
You keep on running and hiding your face, spreading your heat all over the place.
I'm a thief and I dig it!
I'm up on a beef, I'm gonna rig it!
I'm a thief and I dig it!
Oh, Jawbone, why don't you sit and moan?
Oh, Jawbone, you know that it's stone for stone.
Sneak through the night upon your toes.
To look in your eye, it never shows.
Your name upon the post office wall put you on edge because they wrote it too small!
Oh, Jawbone, revenge stays on your mind.
Oh, Jawbone, you been doing too much time.
Pull off a job with an inside man who needs the cash and likes your plan.
Then you will know just who to thank when you land right back in the tank.
Oh, Jawbone, why don't you go home?
Oh, Jawbone, where is it you belong?
Boosting and going out on the lam.
You know that you'll steal anything that you can.
Temptation stands just behind the door, so what you want to go and open it for?

#Sleeping

For the life we chose in the evening we rose just long enough to be lovers again and for nothing more.
the world was too sore to live in.
Sad old ships, a morning eclipse.
I spent my whole life guessing.
Then I turned from the sun and saw everyone searching.
The hoot owl and his song will bring you along.
Where else on earth would you wanna go?
We can leave all this hate before it's too late.
Why would we wanna come back at all?
Cobwebs on my pillow, I'm found in the willow.
I'd spend my whole life sleeping.
To be called by noon is to be called too soon today. 
The storm is passed, there is peace at last.
I'll spend my whole life sleeping.
Now there's not a sound, no one to be found anywhere. 
The shepherd and his sheep will wind you to sleep.
Where else on earth would you wanna go to a land of wonder when you go under?
Why would we want to come back at all?

#Just Another Whistle Stop

To all concerned dead or alive, the locomotive will arrive, bringing souls from all around.
They'll be bound for higher ground.
Look out, stranger, it's coming through with plenty of room for me and you and it's just another whistle stop.
If you don't quit till we reach the top, I'd be much obliged to you.
Odd man out.
you know that's the rule.
You can scream and you can shout, but they'll only call you a crazy fool.
Pay no mind to what they say.
When they're bitter, they talk that way.
I seen a young boy on the run and I seen other children having fun.
A police siren flashing light.
I wonder who went down tonight.
People, people, where do you go before you believe in what you know?
It's just another whistle stop.
If you don't quit till we reach the top, I'd be much obliged to you.
When the trolley is clean out of reach, a certain lesson it will teach.
to grind your axe until it's dull, you've got to get it in your skull.
Tell the people all across the sea, Don't turn your back because it's free.
It's just another whistle stop.
If you don't quit till we reach the top, I'd, I'd be much obliged to you.
And it's odd man out.
You know that's the rule.
You can scream and you can shout, but they'll only call you a crazy fool.
Pay no mind to what you read.
There's one way home that's guaranteed.
