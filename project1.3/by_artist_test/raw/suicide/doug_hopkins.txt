Hey Jealousy 

Tell me, do you think it'd be all right if I could just crash here tonight?
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go.
And you know it might not be that bad.
You were the best I'd ever had.
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone.
Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around.
The past is gone, but something might be found to take its place.
Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
And you can trust me not to think, and not to sleep around.
If you don't expect too much from me, you might not be let down beause all I really want is to be with you, and feel like I matter too.
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might be here with you.
Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around.
The past is gone, but something might be found to take its place.
Hey jealousy.
Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around.

Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
Tell me do you think it'd be all right if I could just crash here tonight.
You can see I'm in no shape for driving, and anyway I've got no place to go.
And you know it might not be that bad.
You were the best I'd ever had.

Tomorrow we can drive around this town, and let the cops chase us around.
The past is gone, but something might be found to take its place.
Hey jealousy.
Hey jealousy.
She took my heart.
Well there's only one thing I couldn't start.

#Found Out About You

All last summer, in case you don't recall, I was yours and you were mine.
Forget it all.
Is there a line that I could write sad enough to make you cry?
All the lines you wrote to me were lies.
The months roll past. 
The love that you struck dead.
Did you love me only in my head?
Things you said and did to me seemed to come so easily.
The love I thought I'd won you give for free.
Whispers at the bus stop.
I heard about nights out in the school yard.
I found out about you.
Rumors follow everywhere you go.
Like when you left and I was last to know.
You're famous now, and there's no doubt.
In all the places you hang out they know your name, and know what you're about.
Whispers at the bus stop.
I heard about nights out in the school yard.
I found out about you.
Street lights blink on through the car window.
I get the time too often on AM radio.
You know it's all I think about.
I write your name. 
Drive past your house.
Your boyfriend's over. 
I watch your light go out.
Whispers at the bus stop.
I heard about nights out in the school yard.
I found out about you.

#Pieces of the Night 

Is it any wonder that the stars just don't rush by when you're only doing 60 through this oh so vacant night?
But it's lacking something big this time.
What the hell did you expect to find, Aphrodite on a barstool by your side?
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
And is it any wonder in the middle of the crowd you let your feet get trampled on when the music is that loud.
But you wanted to be where you are, but it looked much better from afar.
A hillside in shadow between the people and the stars.
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
It seems so distant, but still only half the night away where notions between your questions come too.
Is it any wonder where the pieces of the night have been?
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
Only pieces of the night.
Then I saw.
Only pieces of the night.
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.

#Lost Horizons

The last horizons I can see are filled with bars and factories, and in them all we fight to stay awake.
Drink enough of anything to make this world look new again.
Drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves.
She had nothing left to say, so she said she loved me.
I stood there grateful for the lie.
Drink enough of anything to make this girl look new again.
Drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves.
Turn summer trees to bones and ice.
Turn insect songs against the night with words we build and words we break.
I'm drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves.
Maybe I could use you to reassure myself.
I wouldn't wish this indecision on anybody else.
Drink enough of anything to make this world look new again.
And when the sin smiles, how could it be wrong?
The last horizons I could see are not resigned to memories.
I never thought I'd still be here today.
Drink enough of anything to make myself look new again.
Drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves.
