I Am The Cosmos

Every night I tell myself: "I am the cosmos, I am the wind," but that don't get you back again.
Just when I was starting to feel okay, you're on the phone.
I never want to be alone never want to be alone.
I hate to have to take you home. 
Wanted too much to say no, no. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, never want to be alone.
I hate to have to take you home. 
Want you too much to say no, no. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my feeling's always happening, something I couldn't hide. 
I can't confide. 
Don't know what's going on inside. 
So every night I tell myself: "I am the cosmos, I am the wind," but that don't get you back again. 
I'd really like to see you again. 
I really want to see you again. 
I'd really like to see you again. 
I really want to see you again. 
I'd really like to see you again. 
I really want to see you again. 
I never want to see you again. 
Really want to see you again.

#Better Save Yourself

I'm off the street. 
I'm all alone. 
I just can't think what I've been doing wrong. 
I know you're mine. 
He treats you nice. 
It's suicide. 
I know, I tried it twice. 
You should've given your love to Jesus. 
It couldn't do you no harm. 
Should've given your love to Jesus. 
It wouldn't do you no harm. 
You've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace, but you better save yourself If you want to see his face.
I guess there are things you'd like to know.
It's getting late, and I know you want to go. 
You should've given your love to Jesus. 
It couldn't do you no harm. 
Should've given your love to Jesus. 
It wouldn't do you no harm. 
You've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace, but you better save yourself if you want to see his face. 
I'm off the street. 
I'm all alone. 
I just can't think what I've been doing wrong.

#Speed of Sound	  

I remember the first time you said you loved me. 
I waited all weekend. 
You never called me. 
So you find him attractive. 
So what if he is? 
You'd like some excitement. 
You could count his same kiss. 
So it goes on and on. 
My love grows and yours is gone. 
A lonely existence, well it's just a lie. 
If there is a reason, I'd like to know why. 
Something I want you to know: I've told you this once before, don't want you to see him no more. 
Once again you've let me down, broke my heart, and turned me around. 
There's a light in the darkness. 
It doesn't seem far. 
Is something the matter that's brought us ajar? 
The plane goes down, will not land. 
Pilot's dead. 
Nowhere to be found.
 
#Get Away

I know what it is you're thinking, but baby, it's sacred to me.
Whenever I feel like I'm sinking, you make a beautiful scene.
You don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
Baby, I'm feeling low.
Don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't know what you're putting me through.
Once in a while you're lonely.
If you feel lonely, cry.
I'd love to know what is the matter, unless you're with some other guy, because you don't lie to me and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
Baby, I'm feeling low.
Don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
Do you want to?
I want you.
Do you want to?
I want you too.
Don't you know I'm losing sleep at night, sleep at night?
Don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't know what you're putting me through.
I know what it is you're thinking, but baby, it's strange to me.
Whenever I feel like I'm sinking, you make a beautiful scene.
Don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
And, baby, I'm feeling low.
Don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't know what you're putting me through.

#You and Your Sister    

They say my love for you ain't real, but they don't know how real it feels.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
Your sister says that I'm no good.
You know I'd show her them if I could.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
Love you every day.
Let me hear you say your love won't be leaving.
Your eyes ain't deceiving.
Love you every day.
Let me hear you say: All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
And let me whisper in your ear: don't you worry, they can't hear.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
If you give me a little time, I will show you I ain't lying.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.

#Make a Scene	      

You hurt me yesterday.
I didn't know what to say. 
You didn't have to be so mean. 
You didn't have to make a scene. 
You don't have to be so cruel. 
You made me feel like a fool. 
I heard some things about you. 
They said you was untrue. 
I told them.
Then why is it so? 
You hurt me yesterday.
I didn't know what to say. 
You didn't have to be so mean. 
You didn't have to make a scene. 
You don't have to act so cool. 
I know that you've been to school. 
I started to feel unloved. 
I had no place to go. 
I turned on the radio. 
You hurt me yesterday. 
I didn't know what to say. 
You didn't have to be so mean. 
You didn't have to make a scene. 
Don't have to be so cruel. 
Made me feel like a fool. 
I heard some things about you. 
They said you was untrue. 
I told them.
Then why is it so?

#Look Up	  

Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
Look up.
Look up.
He's the life waiting to love you, wanting to reach you.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
The man walking down the street keeps his head down low.
Doesn't look up, wants to give up.
He just keeps on looking down, staring at the ground.
Standing here at the corner I'm watching him walk away.
Standing here and I don't know why, but I'm thinking it could be a great day.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
Oh, I wish you knew him.
He's been waiting for so long.
If you look up, you'll see him.
You know we're all alone.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
Look up.
Look up.
He's the life waiting to love you, wanting to reach you.
Look up.
Look up.
You'll see the sky.
 
#I Got Kinda Lost

I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost in giving.
I got kind of lost.
And what can I say feeling the way I do?
I'm trying to get it across to you.
Only wanted to be together.
All the time that it was I saw her.
Things that I'd done before are gone.
I can't believe I'm on my own.
Once in a while, and I see you smile, but you don't know how it's going.
I'm trying to get it across to you.
Only wanted to be together.
All the time that it was I saw her.
Things that I'd done before are gone.
I can't believe I'm on my own.
I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost.
I got kind of lost in giving.
I'm trying to get it across to you.

#There Was a Light	

There was a light so dear to me I wanted to live.
There was a time so near to me I asked you to give your life to me.
If it's a sign sent down to me, I'm asking you why it had to be. 
Spending all my time, waiting to die - what's the use? 
There was a light so dear to me I wanted to live. 
There was a time so dear to me I asked you to give your life to me.

#Fight at the Table 

Had a fight at the table.
I didn't think it would end.
I Didn't think I'd be able to go on and pretend.
I been having a good time.
I didn't want you to go, she said. 
Got to leave her alone.
I started dreaming about Emma, and he said, "Don't interfere."
Said "What are you doing in Denver?
There no light in here".
Well, I been having a good time.
I didn't want you to go.
Why can't they stop all this jiving?
You don't want to know.
It must be getting past midnight, and now I'm staring to scream.
She really put up a good fight.
I think this must be a dream.
I been  having a good time.
Babe, I'm lost in the rain.
I told them just when I'm going.
I think I'm going insane.

#I Don't Know	   

Whatever it is you're thinking, sit down and let's give it a try.
You know that I'll always listen, but sometimes I'm wondering why.
You don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
Baby I'm feeling lost.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
Once in a while you're lonely.
Tell me you needed a friend.
I'm wondering what is the matter, but you say that you can't explain.
But you don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
But, baby, I'm feeling lost.
I don't know what I'm going through.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
Do you want me?
I want you.
You don't want me?
I want you.
Don't you know I'm losing sleep at night, sleep at night.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
Whatever it is you're thinking, sit down and let's give it a try.

But, baby, I'm feeling lost.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.

#Though I Know She Lies	    

When I look though your eyes, I tend to get bitter.
Maybe I'm best advised to look to myself.
I fall every time, though I know she lies.
I can't stay away. 
Stars would fall from the sky, and I won't forsake you. 
You've got lust in your heart. 
What's sad to me? 
I'll use every line, anything to make you mine. 
Keeping me in the dark. 
Wondering where you are.
Don't let me fall apart. 
You said take it slow, but I don't know. 
I don't know. 
Lying awake in the bed trying to cope with the feelings. 
I don't know if it's love, but what can I do?
I fall every time, though I know she lies. 
I can't stay away.
