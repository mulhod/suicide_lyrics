Make Light

So now we see.
Comes burying my burnt remains.
These puddled clouds.
Oh I, I understand now.
But darkness falls likes shattered pieces, dangling, shimmering, torn and tattered and crowned.
Oh, I'll not be told "No" to no more.
You must believe to hear me sing these messy morsels of my self-assuring love.
Oh, it's painful kneading.
Yes, I lie and I wrangle with prospective angles that glare me down and face me with all I do wrong.
Why do they all look like me?
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh just to prove I'm alive.
And it's alright because tonight there's a way I'll make light of my treacherous life.
If I had hands, I'd hold up high my lofty dreams, my alibi's real name.
But I have no strength.
So I toss and I turn and I spit in the urn.
There's a ghost in your eye.
There is someone that knows more than I.
But I'm quick to deny.
So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh just to prove I'm alive.
And it's alright because tonight there's a way I'll make light of my treacherous life.
Make light!

#Little Secrets

When I came down, the dawn poured into me.
I shook them up, the walls came crumbling, my thin skin trembling with these salty wounds, my stolen gold inside the emperor's tomb.
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face.
I built this cardboard neighborhood's disgrace.
But I ascend and serve my feverish need within the confines of such chemistry.
It's the way I see everything I need.
It's no way to be.
Let this be our little secret.
No one needs to know we're feeling higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
But I feel alive, oh, I feel it in me.
Up and up we keep on climbing, higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
My face blew up at such a casual sight, the smattered colors of ecstatic fright, the rush above me to oblivion, outlining wet sidewalks in halogen.
Oh, have you ever felt so goddamn strong?
How come it takes some people so damn long?
He turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain.
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains.
Watch the basin drain as your life lines wane and you can't explain as your friends complain.
You've caused all this pain and you proudly shame your whole family's name.
Let this be our little secret.
No one needs to know we're feeling higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
But I feel alive, oh, I feel it in me.
Up and up we keep on climbing, higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking, staring at the stars on your ceiling, thinking once there was a power that you were wielding.
But now I've hit the mark, stabbing at the dark, and I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars.
Let this be our little secret.
No one needs to know we're feeling higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
But I feel alive, oh, I feel it in me.
Up and up we keep on climbing, higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.

#Moth's Wings

Dear friend, as you know your flowers are withering, your mother's gone insane, your leaves have drifted away, but the clouds are clearing up and I've come reveling, burning incandescently like a bastard on the burning sea.
You're just like your father, buried deep under the water.
You're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes.
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown.
Come lay with me on the ground.
You come beating like moth's wings, spastic and violently, whipping me into a storm, shaking me down to the core, but you run away from me and you left me shimmering like diamond wedding rings spinning dizzily down on the floor.
You're just like your father, buried deep under the water.
You're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes.
Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown.
Come lay with me on the ground.

#The Reeling

we dug these holes we crawled into.
now they're my home.
now here i cannot feel the wind, can't feel the rain, oh, no, and i believe in gentle harmony.
well, how i loathe all this obscenity.
is this the way my life has got to be?
have i a single opportunity?
look at me, oh, look at me.
is this the way i'll always be?
oh, no, oh, no.
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me.
oh, no, oh, no.
every day i lie awake and pray to god today's the day.
oh, no, oh, no.
here i am, oh, here i am.
oh, when will someone understand?
oh, no, oh, no.
and all at once i feel this.
oh, how it clings to me.
it reels and calls me towards it, confounding destiny.
and i can feel the madness inch by inch.
the more i run the more i am convinced.
a color all these like the branches glimpse just like the saddle in the foggy mist.
look at me, oh, look at me.
is this the way i'll always be?
oh, no, oh, no.
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me.
oh, no, oh, no.
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today's the day.
oh, no, oh, no.
here i am, oh, here i am.
oh, when will someone understand?
oh, no, oh, no.
look at me, oh, look at me.
is this the way i'll always be?
oh,no, oh, no.
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me.
oh, no, oh, no.
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today's the day.
oh, no, oh, no.
here i am, oh, here i am.
oh, when will someone understand?
oh, no, oh, no.

#Eyes As Candles

My world is stirring sickly.
spits out our voices singing, "oh, no, no".
to kingdom come so slightly.
Here in the void in your place, I twitch and tweak an illusion to sit and stare so blankly until our hope is used up.
Why do I always seem to need you when you're fleeing?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done?
What have I lost that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?
Oh, hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
Some unguarded room.
a smoky figure fills me full, makes my head swell and ruin.
The family kneels at the pew.
They nod.
'We believe in what you're doing'.
I feel you rise above me, the western landscape's towering, and from my shell of a body the flowers blossom for picking.
Why do I always seem to need you when you're fleeing?
Where do you go when I'm around?
What have I done?
what have I got that's so defeating?
And have the nerve to wear a crown?
Oh, hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
I've waited and waited for someone to take it
Don't fight it.
don't bother an inch for another.
Don't listen.
don't hear them.
they're in this together.
I've learned well.
now hear me.
there's much to be fearing.
I'm used to your absence, your faceless distraction.
I've painted your patterns, but found them attractive.
Now I've been leaning towards a life far more candid, though led through the dark with your eyes as my candles, where your life and my life's directions can wrangle and all of a sudden you've left me to handle the reasons that never forbid me to stand tall and somehow, oh, somehow I found out the secret to staying alive without actually breathing.

#Swimming in the Flood

My eyes have once again been proven wrong.
Your clouds, your blanket, and my pity song, hovering on your front lawn, carry on until it's gone.
What can I do?
The river's overrun.
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch, but the water's rising up.
Then I lie naked in a rampage in the flesh, face to face with the onset.
I forget everything that's ever made me.
rise again.
Now slowly leave my memory.
What can I do?
The river's overrun.
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch, but the water's rising up.
Now all my lovers raise their cups.
What can I do?

#Folds in Your Hands

Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone.
i'm fine.
i'll be fine until the morning comes, then unmask me in the blistering sun.
Oh, let me go, just let me go, just let me go or i'll burst in front of your eyes, then collect myself from the ground.
And when i go, and when i go, just let me go like a light, flickering out in the skies, lost as fast as was found.
Everything's easy when you never have to choose.
with the balances shifting it refers to you.
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom.
i will crush our love, let it burn until i get to you.
Lay low.
don't let me know what is real.
we'll be quietly following you.
will they take me as their own?
now i will hold you.
i will keep you up and show my love until it folds in my hands, but i'll build it back to the top.
Everything's easy when you never have to choose.
with the balances shifting it refers to you.
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom.
i will crush our love, let it burn until i get to you.
Feel it rain, feel it rain, my love, feel it rain.

#To Kingdom Come

That's a frosty way to speak, o tell me how to live next to your potpourri.
All this talking pulls my teeth.
I believed in you, so you believed in me.
I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
Once I had a name to claim.
I scraped on the walls like an orthodox saint.
I wish for the same old things that turn me inside out.
hearing is the strain.
it's a game.
Me, I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
Never have I ever been clutching at your hair to cure you of some sin, but that's the kind of state I'm in, swimming in a pool of godly medicine.
"Come, come," I hear it calling me, yelling like if ever there was someone who could make things heavenly again.
Feel alive.
Me, I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.
Me, I cried out, "God".
you dared me in the dark.
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark.
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels.
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel.

#Let Your Love Grow Tall

In pastures blue and green I'll follow you and you'll follow me, my fabric's mystery.
I'll wave your loyalty in the freezing breeze so desperately.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
I think I see my life.
He bows all slyly and gentle-like.
He's never had the right.
I've never lived without his sad and jealous eyes.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
They'd say, "let your love grow tall, let your love grow tall".
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?
Like the darkness in the forest?
Like my frightened worried eyes?
Or the roots in the soil?
Are skies telling lies?
But it's the thought that counts.
Quiet minds don't know their worth.
They know what to do, so I'll pray for them and I'll pray for you till my face turns blue.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
And another one comes down.
They'd say, "let your love grow tall, let your love grow tall".
Tall as the grass in the meadow?
Or the dunes on the shore?
Like the buildings in the city?
And your children on the floor?
Like the darkness in the forest?
Like my frightened worried eyes?
Or the roots in the soil?
Are skies telling lies?

#Seaweed Song

Some day you'll see, surrounded by angels, floating atop of the sea.
Abandon me.
Don't go where they go.
Don't sing all the songs they sing.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do. but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Between these walls her back, strange glimpse, casts shadows frighteningly tall.
I slow to a crawl.
I jump and I yell, but she hears nothing at all.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, ut I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Stay, stay the same beause everything else will change and I've always been to blame, so please just stay the same.
The currents pull me in.
The tide has reached my chin.
The seaweed tickles skin.
Just let the water win.
I'm freezing to the bone.
You'll never be at home.
Just watch, you're running out.
Just watch your body go.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
