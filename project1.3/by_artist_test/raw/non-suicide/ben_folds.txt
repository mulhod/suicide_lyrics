Bastard

The old bastard left his ties and his suit, a brown box, mothballs and bowling shoes, and his opinion so you'd never have to choose.
Pretty soon, you'll be an old bastard too.
You get smaller while the world gets big.
The more you know you know you don't know shit.
The whiz-man'll never fit you like the whiz-kid did.
So why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Close your eyes, close your ears, young man.
You've seen and heard all an old man can.
Spread the facts on the floor like a fan.
Throw away the ones that make you feel bad.
Kids today getting old too fast.
They can't wait to grow up so they can get some ass.
They get nostalgic about the last ten years before the last ten years have passed.
So why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Tears land on a hand on a chest.
The old bastard had a paradigm arrest.
He got smaller and the world got big.
The more he knew he knew we didn't know shit.
The whiz-man never fit him.
the whiz-kid did.
So why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.
Why you got to act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything.

#You To Thank

By the time the buzz was wearing off, we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot Nevada sun.
Kids piled high, and our moms and dads shook hands in a party of Polaroid friends, rented a pool and hired a band.
Maybe they knew more then we knew because they danced and drank while we jumped off the deep end.
Oh I've got you to thank for this.
Christmas came around, yeah, and everything was going to crap and our moms and dads not a clue to be had.
Yeah, we put on a pretty good act and they seemed to all need to believe it, so we danced and smiled and paddled hard beneath it.
Oh I've got you to thank for this.
You can't say you've never had a doubt and smoked it down but really wanted out.
By the time the buzz was wearing off, we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot Nevada sun.
And they won't fade.
I've got you to thank.

#Jesusland

Take a walk.
Out the gate you go and never stop, past dollar stores and wig shops, quarter in a cup for every block.
And watch the buildings grow smaller as you go down the tracks, beautiful McMansions on a hill that. overlook a highway with riverboat casinos and you still have yet to see a soul.
Jesusland, Jesusland.
Town to town, broadcast to each house, they drop your name, but no one knows your face.
Billboards quoting things you'd never say.
You hang your head and pray for Jesusland, Jesusland.
Miles and miles, and the sun going down.
Pulses glow from their homes.
You're not alone.
Lights come on as you lay your weary head on their lawn.
Parking lots, cracked and growing grass.
you see it all from offices to farms.
Crosses flying high above the malls.
A longer walk through Jesusland, Jesusland.

#Landed

We'd hit the bottom.
I thought it was my fault and in a way I guess it was.
I'm just now finding out what it was all about.
We'd moved to the west coast, away from everyone.
She never told me that you called back when I was still, I was still in love till I opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down, and it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right, had to leave myself behind.
And I've been flying high all night, so come pick me up.
I've landed.
The daily dramas she made from nothing, so nothing ever made it right.
She liked to push me and talk me back down till I believed I was the crazy one, and in a way I guess I was.
Well I opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down, and it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
Dragging the sea of a troubled mind, had to leave myself behind.
Singing bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
If you wrote me off, I'd understand it because I've been on some other planet, so come pick me up.
I've landed.
And you will be so happy to know I've come alone.
It's over.
Well I opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down, and it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar.
It's okay to call and I will answer for myself.
Come pick me up.
Come pick me up.
I've landed.

#Gracie

You can't fool me, I saw you when you came out.
You got your mama's taste but you got my mouth.
And you will always have a part of me nobody else is ever going to see, Gracie girl, with your cards to your chest walking on your toes.
What you got in the box only Gracie knows.
And I would never try to make you be anything you didn't really want to be, Gracie girl.
Life flies by in seconds.
You're not a baby, Gracie, you're my friend.
You'll be a lady soon but until then you got to do what I say.
You nodded off in my arms watching TV.
I won't move you an inch even though my arm's asleep.
One day you're going to want to go.
I hope we taught you everything you need to know, Gracie girl.
And there will always be a part of me nobody else is ever going to see but you and me, my little girl, my Gracie girl.

#Trusted

It's funny, I know, but I'm disappointed in you.
I thought you could read my mind but I came home early and saw that a drawer had been opened.
Looks like you've been reading my diary instead.
How does it feel to realize you're all alone behind your eyes?
It seems to me if you can't trust, you can't be trusted.
Caught in a dream, picking up astral signals, some of them psychic.
you better watch what you think.
Happens to be that everybody else's dreams are Freudian clues.
you better watch what you dream.
You want to see the other side, what's going on behind the eyes.
Still it seems if you can't trust, you can't be trusted.
Didn't you know we're as close as we can be?
The sun's coming up.
She's pulled all the blankets over, curled in a ball like she's hiding from me.
And that's when I know she's going to be pissed when she wakes up for terrible things I did to her in her dreams.
You want to see the other side, what's going on behind the eyes.
Still it seems if you can't trust, you can't be trusted.
Didn't you know we're as close as we can be?
Hello.

#Give Judy My Notice

Judy, could anyone be loved anymore than I love you?
Does it hurt you too?
But Judy, I've been feeling small too long.
I love you so, but something's wrong.
And I come running when you want me here.
And when you want me to, I disappear.
Give Judy my notice.
I knew if I made it easy for you, you'd settle for me, yeah eventually.
But Judy, I won't be your bitch anymore and follow you around and hold the door.
And I can't do this any longer.
The vacuum left is so much stronger.
Give Judy my notice.
Give Judy my notice.
Judy you know I'm not mad anymore, at least most of the time, but that could take a while.
I've been living just to see you smile every once in a while.
Tears fall, but that don't mean nothing at all.
It's just because I said it first.
Yeah, that's why it hurts.
And I'm not sorry if you're not sorry.
And you're not sorry until I make you.
Give Judy my notice.

#Late

Under some dirty words on a dirty wall, eating takeout by myself, I played the shows, got back in the van and put the Walkman on and you were playing.
In some other dive a thousand miles away, I played a thousand times before, and like pathetic stars, the truck stops and the rock club walls I always knew, you saw them too, but you never will again.
It's too late.
Don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
Elliott, man, you played a fine guitar and some dirty basketball.
The songs you wrote got me through a lot.
Just want to tell you that.
But it's too late.
It's too late.
No, don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
Oh no things were looking up, at least that's what I heard.
Oh no someone came and washed away your hard-earned peace of mind when desperate static beats the silence up, a quiet truth to calm you down.
The songs you wrote got me through a lot.
Just want to tell you that.
But it's too late.
It's too late.
No, don't you know it's been too late for a long time.
It's too late.
It's too late.
No, don't you know it's been too late for a long time.

#Sentimental Guy

There's a moment in my mind I scribbled and erased a thousand times like a letter never written or sent.
These conversations with the dead.
I used to be a sentimental guy.
Now I'm haunted by the left unsaid.
I never thought so much could change.
Little things you said or did are part of me, come out from time to time.
Probably no one I know now would notice.
But I never thought so much could change.
You drifted far away, far away it seems.
Time has stopped, the clock keeps going.
People talking and I'm watching as flashes of their faces go black and white and fade to yellow in a box in an attic.
But I never thought so much could change.
Now I don't miss anyone.
I don't miss anything.
What a shame because I used to be a sentimental guy.

#Time

Think of me any way you want.
I can be the problem if that's easier.
In your head, move the pieces around, things I've said.
Turn the memory upside down and it makes it better, I know, but sometimes it's hard to swallow.
In time, I will fade away.
In time, I won't hear what you're saying.
In time, but time takes time, you know.
Tell your friends the things they want to hear and see.
Start the drums.
Band against the enemy and in time I will fade away.
In time, I won't care what you're saying.
In time, but time takes time, you know.
In your head, move the pieces around, things I've said.
Turn the memory upside down.
It might make it better, I know, but sometimes it's hard to swallow.
In time, I will fade away.
In time, I won't care what you're saying.
In time, but time takes time, you know.
Time takes time you know.

#Prison Food

You walked the earth, talked and never spoke a word.
She wonders who will be the first to go.
I said you know, the biggest things we got to face alone.
Don't want to waste time and go.
alone alone again.
alone alone again.
A trace of me, it floats in my periphery and, every time I turn to see, it goes.
Alone alone again lone alone again.
Alone alone again.
Floating by like a satellite to pass the time, you'll float by again and I can tell you about the little. things so you don't think about the big things for a while.
You walked the earth, talked and never spoke a word.
She wonders who will be the first to go.
Alone alone again.
Alone alone again.
Alone alone again.
Alone alone again alone.
