the ballad of henry & susannah , pt . 1

come all you gentle people and listen to my tale , concerning a poor convict .
from suffolk he did hail .
for fourteen years transported , as you shall understand for to lead a poor and wretched life upon van diemen 's land .
young henry cabell was his name , and in mendham he did dwell .
his poor but honest parents , they reared him right well till cruel hardship overcame them and his father in despair to feed his family did embark upon a wild career .

#us poor fellows

the times they are hard and the wages are poor .
none of us poor fellows has money in store .
so how can a good man keep the wolf from the door ?
poor fellows , we all will go down .
when work it is scarce , tell me , how can we eat ?
how can we afford to buy shoes for our feet ?
and how can we get clothing to keep off the sleet ?
poor fellows , we might as well drown .
if we could find labor we never would complain .
we 'd work well for a master , his favour to gain .
we 'd be honest and faithful with never a stain .
but , poor fellows , how will we survive ?
we could plough the good land .
we could fish the salt sea .
we could work in the woodland felling of trees .
but when only the breath of our bodies is free , poor fellows , can we stay alive ?
now a man that is single , he 's free of all care .
he can soon leave a district if no work be there .
there 's no manner of hardship that he cannot bear .
poor fellows , if he is alone .
but a man with a family , his hands they are tied .
he must look to their comfort or lose all his pride .
he ca n't wander away but must stay by their side , poor fellows , and maintain his home .
oh a man that is willing ca n't understand why he can find no employment , how hard he may try .
and it break his poor heart for to see his wife cry , so poor fellow , he 'll do what he can .
and a man that is desperate and ca n't find a job , he will not be contended to sit home and sob .
be he ever so honest , he 'll turn out and rob , poor fellow , to prove he 's a man .
if a good man goes robbing , you know it 's a shame .
he brings scorn and misfortune on his honest name .
but it pitiful straits , tell me , who is to blame ?
poor fellow , you know he must try .
so let 's hope that these hard times they soon pass away .
all unto our sweet saviour we earnestly pray that this dark , cloudy morn brings a glorious day .
poor fellows , sometime ere we die .

# the robber 's song

my name is abe carman .
my trade it is right charming , for you know there is no harm in a little burglary .
i live by taking chances , like the heroes of romances , and taking what i fancies with bold audacity !
there 's wealth all for the taking , and there is no mistaking , my fortune i am making with a little robbery .
no man shall be my master as long as i run faster than those that would me blast for taking things for free !
i 've robbed the great and wealthy in manner sly and stealthy , but it 's just to keep me healthy as you can plainly see .
no watch , no ring , no clock it is not safe within your pocket , and it will avail you naught to lock it from light-fingered gentry !

# the ballad of henry & susannah , pt . 2

so his father with a band went out when all lay sound asleep into a house in alburgh town those desperate men did creep.
young henry he went with them , having reached his nineteenth year .
his part it was to stand a watch and see the coast was clear .
but fortune was not with that band , kind favor passed them by , for the constables they soon did come and did raise the hue and cry .
they was quickly overtaken and carried to the jail for to wring their hands and curse their fate until their strength did fail .
it was at thetford assizes at the bar they soon did stand , and the sentence it was given that all three of them should hang .
but up spoke henry 's mother , crying , " spare my only son , for his years are few , and for one crime his race should not be run . "
fourteen years of transportation became henry 's punishment , and to the cells of norwich castle this young man was sent .
leaving his tender mother for to tear her hair in woe as her husband and abe carman to the gallows-tree did go .

# the leaves in the woodland

oh the grass in the meadow , the reeds by the mere , the sad boom of the bittern is all that i hear .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall sit by your loved ones no more .
when i was a young girl the world did seem gay , but these cruel hard times do drive comfort away .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall dance with your sweetheart no more .
once i gathered wild flowers in the sweet countryside , but my garlands have withered .
my posies have died .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall lie by your husband no more .
once i went a-courting , but now my man 's gone .
once i was a mother , but now i 'm alone .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall walk with your menfolk no more .
come all you young women that 's free from all care .
do n't you ever get married , all sorrows lies there .
for the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : the heart that is given no man may restore .
now the fields are all empty .
the hedgerows are bare .
only wild desolation is all i find there .
i 'll go down to the river to ease all my pain , and who knows , but i might find my dear ones again .

# the ballad of henry & susannah , pt . 3

he had not been in norwich jail nine months unto a year when a pretty norfolk serving maid , she also was sent there .
for stealing silver teaspoons , she from thurlton village came for fourteen years of transport far across the raging main .

#i once lived in service

i once lived in service to a lady so fine .
i 've served her by night and by day .
i 've carried the dishes when the lady would dine , and after , i cleared them away .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is all slavery .
i 've made up her bed , and i turned down her sheets .
i ironed the dresses she wore .
i 've peeled her potatoes .
i 've roasted her meats .
and it was i , with my broom , swept her floor .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is all misery .
i scrubbed her front doorstep.
i polished her plate .
i put coals in the pan for her bed .
i 've rose before sunlight to blacklead her grate , and at midnight i 've laid down my head .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is all drudgery .
i 've carried her water .
i 've answered her door .
i 've polished the shoes for her feet .
and when she went to church , then her prayer-book i bore behind as she marched down the street .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant 's a penance to me .
now , i met a young man in the village one day as i run to the shop for her bread .
he 's asked me my name , but i had to away lest me mistress should break me poor head .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant has no liberty .
so that night as i lay in my attic so bare , i resolved that i would run away .
and all for to honor the waggoner 's fare , some silver spoons took for me pay .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is melancholy .
now i lie in prison but i will not weep.
who knows what tomorrow may hold ?
there 's some fine lads in here for my company to keep.
there 's strong arms to keep me from cold .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a convict is all chivalry !
now i 've known confinement the most of me years .
small freedom did i ever know .
some prisons , sure , they have no cold iron bars , but some prisons , why , they have no men !
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a convict 's a pleasure to me .
dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant was never so free !

#norwich jail

so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail .
the food is foul .
the air is bad .
the company not choice .
it would make you scowl to hear that mad old turnkey 's rasping voice .
it would make you wonder would you ever live to tell the tale of the hardships and the miseries you 've known in norwich jail .
our water here is scummy-green .
our beds is heaps of straw .
there 's water running down the walls , rats running over the floor .
there 's naught to eat but rotten meat that 'd make a dog turn pale .
oh , it 's dainty board and lodging when you visit norwich jail !
so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail .
whene 'er we fancy bathing , we paddles in the drains .
and when we wants a concert , we rattles of our chains .
and when we want a banquet we drink sludge and call it ale .
if you want a good time , commit a crime and come to norwich jail !
now if you fancy gaming here , the race is run by fleas .
the stakes are perilously high : a crust of moldy cheese .
the first time that i tried my luck , i nearly lost my shirt .
but lucky for me they could n't see the bugger for the dirt .
so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail .
if they 'd sent us to america , today we would be free .
but since the revolution that land we 'll never see .
we are not for new england 's shores , three thousand miles away .
they say we 're bound for some further ground and they 've named it botany bay .
well perhaps it 's out by india , or maybe near japan .
just off the coast of canada or in the hills of spain .
but wherever that strange land may be we know it cannot fail to be a far , far better place than stinking norwich jail .
so early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell .
so early in the morning we wish his soul to hell .
so early in the morning when the night begins to pale we long for the day when we 'll sail away from stinking norwich jail .

#sweet loving friendship

if you look out from some high , high window , you will see the sun set beyond the town .
you will see the rooks to the tree-tops screaming , and the wing of evening come folding down .
between the morning and the evening , between the springtime and the winter drear , there comes a time of new beginnings , when sweet loving friendship drives away all fear .
there is many here they know naught but sorrow , and like the beasts they live from day to day .
but we can think on a bright tomorrow since sweet loving friendship drives all grief away .
all hope in prison , it soon will smother if none will with you your sorrow share .
but we cling fast to one each other and sweet loving friendship banishes despair .
just like the sailor when his ship makes harbor , just like the traveller who finds an inn , what care they if the wind blows harder when they be safe and warm within ?
no lonely convict can resist the darkness , just as no sailor can the driving rain .
but find a comrade for to share your fastness and sweet loving friendship will ease your pain .
so if you look out from some high , high window , and see the sun set beyond the sky .
you need not mourn at the coming shadow if some loving friend is standing nigh .

# the ballad of henry and susannah , pt . 4

for three long years and upward in that dark and bitter cell young henry and susannah they lovingly did dwell .
and in seventeen and eighty six , she bore him a baby boy .
who would believe that such a pit could ever hold such joy ?
but sorrow quickly followed which did pierce them to the heart for the news was to them carried that their family must part .
young henry was to stay in jail , as he did understand , while susannah she was to be sent to far van diemen 's land .
down on his knees he pleaded , all from his breaking heart , that from his own dear loved ones he would not be forced to part .
but in that dreary dungeon young henry had to stay as his sweetheart and his little son to plymouth were conveyed .

# the black and bitter night

it is cold , sad , and lonely in this dismal cell .
no solace comes up with the day .
my heart knows an anguish that no tongue can tell since they 've taken my true love away .
oh , the black and bitter night , and oh , the weary day .
my love has been snatched far , far from my sight , and the transports will bear her away .
when first in this prison so deep was my pain .
then she came and she banished dismay .
but now in despondence i 'm drowning again , for they 've taken my true love away .
though surrounded by horrors , yet we found delight , for where love is , no sorrow can stay .
but misery and squalor swim back to my sight now they 've taken my true love away
why , the grasses still grow , and the streams still down flow , and the blackbird still sings on the spray .
but in dank , deary dungeons there 's nothing but woe since they 've taken my true love away .
well , if i were a seagull , i 'd fly to her side , and it 's there that i wish i could stay .
but soon the cruel prison ships leave with the tide and they 've bearing my true love away .
if i were a herring , i 'd wait by the slip , though i waited a year and a day .
then through the wide ocean i 'd follow the ship that is bearing my true love away
so lovers , cling fast to each pleasure you find and cherish each moment of play , for all you will have is what stays in your mind once they 've taken your true love away .

# the humane turnkey ( 1 )

" come rise you up , john simpson , " the governor did say .
" these scum are chained and ready , and it 's time you was away .
three woman and a farthing child , to plymouth they are bound ,
and you must be their escort till they reach that distant town . "
when me and these poor convicts did arrive at plymouth strand , i marched them up onto the deck all chained hand to hand .
the captain saw us come aboard and he did prove unkind .
" the women come , " he did declare , " but the infant stays behind . "
this proud unfeeling seaman , captain gilbert was his name .
oh , to see a babe abandoned so , i swore it was a shame .
i wrapped it up in my great-coat , to the coach i went straightway and i started out for london town without no more delay .

# the plymouth mail

the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
when i was a lad i used to play by the roadside all the live-long day , hoping always to espy the gentry 's coaches rolling by .
when i was a youth i used to roam with a waggoner from town to town , but i longed to fly across the land on a stagecoach high with a four-in-hand .
now i am grown unto a man on the driver 's box i take my stand .
like the captain bold of a ship of sail , i 'm the man who drives the plymouth mail .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
with six on top and four inside , the post-poy and the guard beside , their bags and baggage safely stowed , it 's time to take the open road .
then the hooves do fly , and the wheels spin round and we bid adieu to plymouth town .
plympton , brent , and ashburton pass , and to exeter we comes at last .
then the horses blow , and their sides do steam , as the ostlers run to change the team .
the travellers gulp a glass of ale then back they scramble on the plymouth mail .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
we roll across the dorset downs and stage again in shaftesbury town .
then i crack my whip with might and main , and on we roll to salisbury plain .
soon over hounslow heath we fly where the gibbets loom against the sky .
and the passengers all hide their gold for fear we meet some robbers bold .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
at the sign of the standard in cornhill , at last my rumbling wheels are still .
and the passengers all stiff and sore thank god their journey 's safely over .
in a cozy parlor now i stand with a goodly bumper to my hand , and the travellers drink a glass of ale to the health of the driver of the plymouth mail .
the whip goes crack , and the horn does blow .
the turnpike calls , and i must go .
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .

# the humane turnkey ( 2 )

now when i came to london , having rode two hundred mile , to see a turnkey nurse a babe , it cause the crowd to smile .
but hearing its sad history , it made the crowd to groan , and many a worthy citizen swore justice would be done .
then up and spoke a gentleman and loudly did declare that only one man in the land could settle the affair .
so to lord sydney 's house i went , the crowd did follow on , for they swore they would see charity before the day was done .
when we came to lord sydney 's house , it was the hour of nine .
we all came bursting in on him as he sat down to dine .
he listened to my story , and his countenance was grave , then declared that ere the week was out , the family would be saved .
lord sydney wrote two letters and he signed them with his hand , one to plymouth , one to norwich , bidding them to understand that young cabell and the baby with susannah were to go as a united family unto that distant shore .
now i 'm home again in norwich but some other trade i 'll seek as a coachman or a waggoner , a shopman or a sweep .
perhaps i 'll take the shilling or go wear the jacket blue .
there 's no trade but it 's the kinder , so locks and bars , adieu !

# the green fields of england

farewell to our lovers and our kind relations .
farewell to the homes we love well .
there is never an ending to our tribulations , for they 've damned us like sinners to hell .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
from devon , from derby , from wiltshire and wales , from norwich , from newark and frome , we are herded together from verminous jails and like vermin are forced from our homes .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's cheats and cut-purses and rogues with no name .
there 's swindlers and sheep-stealers bold .
there 's poor poaching fellows took nothing but game , and there 's footpads took nothing but gold !
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's coiners and clippers and ladies of pleasure .
there 's dicers and drunkards and whores .
there 's butchers and bakers who dealt in short measures , and a few who have broken no laws .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's some who expected to go to the scaffold .
there 's others who thought to go free .
but now one and all in the hulks lie shackled , and together must plough the salt sea .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
there 's some of our number are handsome and hearty .
there 's others the voyage will mend .
but there 's never a soul of our miserable party will live to see england again .
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green fields of england .
now we 're parting from you .
the sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives .
and on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives .
so farewell to all judges so kind and forgiving .
farewell to your prisons and cells .
for though me must leave all that makes life worth living , we are leaving you bastards as well !

#roll down

sweet ladies of plymouth , we 're saying goodbye .
roll down !
but we 'll rock you and roll you again by and by .
walk her round , my brave boys and roll down !
and we will roll down !
walk her round , my brave boys and roll down !
now the anchor 's aweigh and the sails are unfurled , and we 're bound for to take her half-way round the world .
in the wide bay of biscay the seas will run high , and the poor sickly transports they 'll wish they could die .
when the wild coast of africa it do appear , the poor nervous transports they 'll tremble with fear .
when the cape of good hope it is rounded at last , the poor lonesome transports they 'll long for the past .
when the great southern whales on our quarter do spout , the poor simple transports they 'll goggle and shout .
and when we arrive off australia 's strand , the poor weary transports they 'll long for the land .
and when we set sail for old england 's shore , the poor stranded transports we 'll see them no more .
then sweet ladies of plymouth we 'll pay all your rent , and go roving no more till our money 's all spent .

# the still and silent ocean

across the still and the silent ocean our ship she finds her way alone .
the crew they make no loud commotion .
the chained transports they make no moan .
all black despair do lie behind us , and what awaits us no man may know .
of those dark days naught can remind us .
new worlds are waiting to which we go .
are we in chains ?
we do not feel them .
are we ill-quartered ?
we do n't complain .
do we have guards ?
we do not see them .
do we have sickness ?
we fell no pain .
for the night is passed .
new days are dawning .
winter is over , and spring draws nigh .
what 's done is done .
there 's no time for mourning .
what 's lost is lost , and there 's no time to sigh .
god bless those tender-hearted creatures who brought us back to our own again .
good health to all whose kind deeds did reach us .
good luck to them who did ease our pain .
glad fortune come to mrs . jackson , to bold john simpson and lord sydney too .
almighty god , do spare and keep them , and grant them peace when their days are through .
come all you poor benighted convicts .
come join us in our present joy .
come all you seamen who sail the tropics .
rejoice with us that our goal is nigh .
when we 're ashore the priest will wed us , as soon as we do reach the strand .
salute the captain who here has led us to the hopeful pastures of van diemen 's land !

# the ballad of henry and susannah , pt . 5

it was in the month of january australia 's coast drew near , and in that fair clime the sun did shine which filled their hearts with cheer .
and soon in peaceful sydney cove at anchor they did ride and admired the green and pleasant shore beyond the foaming tide .
then up spoke captain philip , for so richly dressed was he : " some man must bear me through the surf and keep me from the sea ! "
then up stepped henry cabell , being one both stout and tall , saying , " captain , i will be that man and will not let you fall . "
and so they sat them in the jolly boat , and the crew did pull for land .
and when they reached the shallows , henry o 'er the gunwale sprang .
he took the captain up on his back and he waded to the sand .
the very first of exiles in that distant part to stand .
and a fortnight later henry took susannah for his wife , the comfort of his darkest days to comfort him through life .
and when their years of sentence passed , their happiness did grow with property , prosperity and children also .
and so come all you gentle people who are lost in dark dismay , and remember that the blackest night must some time yield to day .
remember that the wildest storm eventually must pass and , like henry and susannah , may you find your joy at last .
