fisherman

between the darkness and the light , as the stars fade out of sight , i can hear his shiny boots fall on the sand .
with a basket at his side , and the morning full of pride you can see him cast his line with skillful hands .
hey , hey , fisherman , wish you luck that 's all i can .
hey , hey , fisherman , forget the world if that 's your plan .
as the morning turns to noon , he 's content to sit and croon , and he lights his twisted pipe and settles down .
onward goes the time as he tries new baited line , so he digs another worm up from the ground .
hey , hey , fisherman , wish you luck that 's all i can .
hey , hey , fisherman , forget the world if that 's your plan .
between the nightness and the light , the line is taut .
he has a bite , and he hauls the beauty in with skillful pride .
and his patient mind is blown because the fish is overgrown .
it was really worth a day for such a prize .
hey hey , fisherman .

#beautiful and blue

she looks out of her window at the people passing by .
they look so happy .
makes her cry .
she watches them laughing .
sees the lovers holding hands , and everyone each other 's friends .
beautiful and blue , they 're not as good as you .
beautiful and blue , they 're lonely too .
she feels so unhappy .
she no longer cares for life and is close to ending all her strifes .
the world does n't know her .
it 's so hard and cold and cruel .
she wonders why she 's such a fool .
beautiful and blue .
beautiful and blue .

#angelique

angelique , your name is whispered by the passing breeze .
proclaims your beauty to the tallest trees .
and you 're mine , angelique .
angelique , you stand alone because none compares with you .
so far from those who try to be with you .
and you 're mine , angelique .
angelique , your kiss is only like the morning dew .
you smile , the whole wide world , it smiles with you .
and you 're mine , angelique .
and you 're mine , angelique .
i 'll never be with you , never ever touch your hand .
so i 'll just dream of you , lonely in my wonder land .
angelique , when will i ever meet a girl like you ?
and if i do , how will i know it 's true , that you 're mine , angelique ?

#maybe tomorrow

listen to a lonely sound .
see the grey and sadness all around .
see the people go their way .
care not of me and the love i 've lost today .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've looked into her eyes .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've seen her once or twice .
and so i 'm living for a dream .
each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine .
i 'll make believe that i do n't care .
i 'll tell my friends i love my life .
i 'm happy .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've looked into her eyes .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've seen her once or twice .
wherever , whoever you may be , let the light of your love shine through the window of my heart .
then when you 've colored all my thoughts bright , do n't let me ever ever think of night , no yeah !
maybe tomorrow you will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've looked into her eyes .
maybe tomorrow you will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've seen her once or twice .
maybe tomorrow you will love again .

#money

money stole my lady .
fools have a way of making me lazy .
money buy you freedom .
rules have a way of making me crazy .
so we grow a little older with another tale to tell .
so we grow a little colder with another tale to tell .
money make you feel unhappy .
fools have a way of making me crazy .
so we grow a little older with another tale to tell .
so we grow a little colder with another tale to tell .

#it 's over

pack my bag .
i 'm going away .
it 's over .
going home .
thank you , people , but it 's too much to stay .
it 's done now .
i 'm going home .
now i feel like i 'm warm .
now i feel like i 'm tuned .
spent my time and some fun , and for that i thank you .
it 's over .
it 's over .
it 's over .
i 'm going home .
it 's over .
it 's over , and for that i thank you .
now i feel like i 'm warm .
now i feel like i 'm tuned .
spent my time and some fun , and for that i thank you .
it 's over .
it 's over .
it 's over .
i 'm going home .
it 's over .
it 's over , and for that i thank you .

# no good at all

do n't let your mother see you rock .
do n't let your mother see you roll .
do n't let your mother hear you knocking .
do n't let your mother see you go .
do n't ever let her see you out of your head .
do you no good at all .
do n't let your brother put you down .
do n't let your brother put you on .
do n't let your brother hear your barking .
do n't let your brother see you go .
do n't ever let him see you out of your head .
do you no good at all .

#sing for the song

words wo n't come together , and they 're very hard to me .
peace of mind is all i have to win .
tuning does n't matter just as long as i can sing .
get myself together for the song , and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
yes , we 'll all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
now , i get to feeling that it may be just a dream .
may be just another foolish game .
as long as we all sing it when we have no time to think .
have no time for bringing down our friends .
and we can all sing , sing for the song .
yes , we 'll all bring , bring it along .
yes , we 'll all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .

#blind owl

lies , ties , mr . cool disguise .
hang it up .
get up on your own .
pill-driven skills , weeping whip-poor-wills .
too much going around that you ca n't hide .
look out for the blind owl .
you can only find that you were wrong .
no one else around me ever loved me like you do , so i 'll be strong .
look out for the blind owl .
you can only find that you were wrong .
no one else around me ever loved me like you do , so i 'll be strong .
days , plays , interviewer 's maze .
play the role .
sell your soul .
becoming to yourself , a hero who must never lie .
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?

# when i say

what you are is what i see .
what i see is what i want it to be .
when i say i love you , what i mean is i really do .
i 'm not the one who 'll give you everything you need , but what i mean is that i 'll try .
i ca n't deny that i 've been burning inside for all the things i 'll never see .
so come on , be yourself , nothing else .
who could ask for any more ?
and you know , they all love you .
what is more , i really do .
i 'm not the one who 'll give you everything you need , but what i mean is that i 'll try .
i ca n't deny that i 've been burning inside for all the things i 'll never see .

# where do we go from here

someone gives you their heart , but you still throw it all away , knowing the past is a part , part of what you are today .
we all know you had your troubles .
we all know you had your days .
what is love ?
you can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride , telling yourself you 're a loser like someone winning who 's not , telling yourself you 're a loser .
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
someone showed you the way that you 'll be ready to see that the game had been played .
losers had lost , and the winners were free .
we all know you have your troubles .
we all know you have your ways .
what is love ?
you can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride , telling yourself you 're a loser like someone winning who 's not , telling yourself you 're a loser .
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
we all know you have your troubles .
we all know you have your days .
what is love ?
you can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride , telling yourself you 're a loser like someone winning who 's not , telling yourself you 're a loser .
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?

#king of the load

he 's the king of the road , the old man , the child .
the joker running wild , making it funny .
he 's of no fixed abode .
when he carries the load , he 'll do anything he can to make it funny .
but he 'll never say die if he 's living a lie .
pick up his hat and go .
if there 's reason to cry , he 'll just make it a sigh , and wander on down the road .
he 's a natural friend with the money to lend , or whatever it takes to turn you on , too .
he 's the father , the son .
he do n't owe anyone .
all his debts are all paid with his confection .
then he 'll wander away with no time in his way .
pick up his hat and go .
he 'll never say die if he 's living a lie .
just wander on down the road , wander on down the road .
and he 'll wander away with no time in his way .
pick up his hat and go .
he never said die .
he was living a lie .
just wandered on down the road , wandered on down the road , wandered on down the road .

#lost inside your love

what can i say ?
what can i do ?
all of my life i 've been a victim of you .
what can i say or do ?
lost inside your love .
what can it be ?
who can i see ?
all of your life you 've been the winner in me .
what can i say or do ?
lost inside your love .
is it any wonder , there 's no reason why ?
is it all because i left it open wide for your pride , to leave me one more time ?
are you leaving me one more time ?
what can i say ?
what can i do ?
all of my life i 've been a winner with you .
what can i say or do ?
lost inside your love .
lost inside your love .
lost inside your love .
