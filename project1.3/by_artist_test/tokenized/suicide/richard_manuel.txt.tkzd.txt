in a station

once i walked through the halls of a station .
someone called your name .
in the streets i heard children laughing .
they all sound the same .
wonder , could you ever know me , know the reason why i live ?
is there nothing you can show me ?
life seems so little to give .
once i climbed up the face of a mountain and ate the wild fruit there , fell asleep until the moonlight woke me and i could taste your hair .
is n't everybody dreaming ?
then the voice i hear is real .
out of all the idle scheming , ca n't we have something to feel ?
once upon a time they used me indeed .
tomorrow never comes .
i could sing the sound of your laughter .
still i do n't know your name .
must be some way to repay you out of all the good you gave .
if a rumour should delay you , love seems so little to say .

# we can talk

we can talk about it now .
it 's that same old riddle only starting from the middle .
i 'd fix it , but i do n't know how .
well , we could try to reason , but you might think it 's treason .
one voice for all , echoing along the hall .
do n't give up on father clock .
we can talk about it now .
come , let me show you how to keep the wheels turning .
you 've got to keep the engine churning .
but did you ever milk a cow ?
i had the chance one day , but i was all dressed up for sunday .
everybody , everywhere , do you really care ?
well , then , pick up your heads and walk .
we can talk about it now .
it seems to me we 've been holding something underneath our tongues .
i 'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back , it would likely burst your lungs .
stop me if i should sound kind of down in the mouth , but i 'd rather be burned in canada than to freeze here in the south .
moving that eternal plough .
we 've got to find a sharper blade or have a new one made .
rest awhile and cool your brow .
do n't you see there 's no need to slave , the whip is in the grave .
no , no trance .
it 's safe now to take a backward glance because the flames have turned to chalk .
we can talk about it now .

#lonesome suzie

lonesome suzie never got the breaks .
she 's always losing and so she sits and cries and shakes .
it 's hard just to watch her and , if i touch her , oh , poor suzie , i 'm wondering what to do .
she just sits there hoping for a friend .
i do n't fit here , but i may have a friend to lend .
maybe i mistook her , but i ca n't overlook her .
must be someone who can pull her through .
anyone who 's felt that bad could tell me what to say .
even if she just got mad she might be better off that way .
and where is all the understanding ?
her problems ca n't be that demanding .
why is it she looks my way every time she starts to cry ?
lonesome suzie , i ca n't watch you cry no longer , if you can use me until you feel a little stronger .
i guess just watching you has made me lonesome too .
why do n't we get together ?
what else can we do ?

#katie 's been gone

katie 's been gone since the spring time .
she wrote one time and sent her love .
katie 's been gone for such a long time now .
i wonder what kind of love she 's thinking of .
dear katie , if you can hear me , i ca n't wait to have you near me .
dear katie , since you caught that bus , well , i do n't know how things are with us .
i 'm still here and you 're out there .
katie laughed when i said i was lonely .
she said , " there 's no need to feel that way " .
katie said that i was her only one , but then i wonder why she did n't wanna stay .
dear katie , if i 'm the only one , how much longer will you be gone ?
oh , katie , wo n't you tell me straight , how much longer do i have to wait ?
i 'll believe you , but please come through .
i know it 's wrong to be apart this long .
you should be here , near me .
katie 's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind .
she 's gone to find some newer places , left the old life far behind .
dear katie , do n't you miss your home ?
i do n't see why you had to roam .
dear katie , since you 've been away , i lose a little something every day .
i need you here , but you 're still out there .
dear katie , please drop me a line .
just write , love , to tell me you 're fine .
oh , katie , if you can hear me , i just ca n't wait to have you near me .
i can only think , where are you , what you do , maybe there 's someone new .

#orange juice blues ( blues for breakfast )

i had a hard time waking this morning .
i got a lotta things on my mind , like those friends of yours .
they keep bringing me down , just hanging around all the time .
i 've had a hard time waking most mornings and it 's been that way for a month or more .
you 've had things your way , but now i 've got to say i 'm on my way out the door .
why do n't you get right , try to get right , baby ?
you have n't been right with me .
why do n't you get right , try and get right , baby ?
do n't you remember how it used to be ?
why do n't you get right , try to get right , baby ?
you have n't been right with me .
why do n't you get right , try and get right , baby ?
do n't you remember how it used to be ?
you had a hard time waking this morning and i can see it in your empty eyes , but there 's no need for talking or walking round the block just to figure out the reason why .
i have a hard time handing out warnings .
i 'll just slide on out the door because i 'm tired of everything being beautiful , beautiful , and i ai n't coming back no more .
why do n't you get right , try to get right , baby ?
you have n't been right with me .
why do n't you get right , try and get right , baby ?
do n't you remember how it used to be ?

# when you awake

ollie told me , i 'm a fool , so i walked on down the road a mile , went to the house that brings a smile , sat upon my grandpa 's knee and what do you think he said to me ?
when you awake , you will remember everything .
you will be hanging on a string from your...
when you believe , you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know .
ollie showed me the fork in the road .
you can take to the left or go straight to the right .
use your days and save your nights .
careful where you step and watch what you eat .
sleep with the light and you got it beat .
when you awake , you will remember everything .
you will be hanging on a string from your...
when you believe , you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know .
ollie warned me , it 's mean old world .
the street do n't greet you , yes , it 's true .
what am i supposed to do ?
read the writing on the wall .
i heard it when i was very small .
when you awake , you will remember everything .
you will be hanging on a string from your...
when you believe , you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know .
wash my hands in lye water , i got a date with the captain 's daughter .
you can go and tell your brother .
we sure gonna love one another , oh , yeah .
may be right and you might be wrong .
i ai n't gonna worry all day long .
snow 's gonna come and the frost gonna bite .
my old car froze up last night .
ai n't no reason to hang my head .
i could wake up in the morning dead .
if i thought it would do any good , i 'd stand on the rock where moses ...

# whispering pines

if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream , here inside my lonely room there is no in between .
if you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream , inside my lonely room there is no in between .
whispering pines , rising of the tide .
if only one star shines , that 's just enough to get inside .
i will wait until it all goes around .
with you in sight the lost are found .
foghorn through the night , calling out to sea .
protect my only light for she once belonged to me .
let the waves rush in , let the seagulls cry for , if i live again , these hopes will never die .
i can feel you standing there , but i do n't see you anywhere .
standing by the well , standing by the well , wishing for the rains , wishing for the rains , reaching to the clouds , reaching to the clouds for nothing else remains .
drifting in a daze when evening will be done , try looking through a haze at an empty house in the cold , cold sun .
i will wait until it all goes around .
with you in sight the lost are found .

# jawbone

oh , jawbone , when did you first go wrong ?
oh , jawbone , where is it you belong ?
three time loser , you 'll never learn , lay down your tools before you burn .
you keep on running and hiding your face , spreading your heat all over the place .
i 'm a thief and i dig it !
i 'm up on a beef , i 'm gonna rig it !
i 'm a thief and i dig it !
oh , jawbone , why do n't you sit and moan ?
oh , jawbone , you know that it 's stone for stone .
sneak through the night upon your toes .
to look in your eye , it never shows .
your name upon the post office wall put you on edge because they wrote it too small !
oh , jawbone , revenge stays on your mind .
oh , jawbone , you been doing too much time .
pull off a job with an inside man who needs the cash and likes your plan .
then you will know just who to thank when you land right back in the tank .
oh , jawbone , why do n't you go home ?
oh , jawbone , where is it you belong ?
boosting and going out on the lam .
you know that you 'll steal anything that you can .
temptation stands just behind the door , so what you want to go and open it for ?

#sleeping

for the life we chose in the evening we rose just long enough to be lovers again and for nothing more .
the world was too sore to live in .
sad old ships , a morning eclipse .
i spent my whole life guessing .
then i turned from the sun and saw everyone searching .
the hoot owl and his song will bring you along .
where else on earth would you wanna go ?
we can leave all this hate before it 's too late .
why would we wanna come back at all ?
cobwebs on my pillow , i 'm found in the willow .
i 'd spend my whole life sleeping .
to be called by noon is to be called too soon today .
the storm is passed , there is peace at last .
i 'll spend my whole life sleeping .
now there 's not a sound , no one to be found anywhere .
the shepherd and his sheep will wind you to sleep.
where else on earth would you wanna go to a land of wonder when you go under ?
why would we want to come back at all ?

# just another whistle stop

to all concerned dead or alive , the locomotive will arrive , bringing souls from all around .
they 'll be bound for higher ground .
look out , stranger , it 's coming through with plenty of room for me and you and it 's just another whistle stop .
if you do n't quit till we reach the top , i 'd be much obliged to you .
odd man out .
you know that 's the rule .
you can scream and you can shout , but they 'll only call you a crazy fool .
pay no mind to what they say .
when they 're bitter , they talk that way .
i seen a young boy on the run and i seen other children having fun .
a police siren flashing light .
i wonder who went down tonight .
people , people , where do you go before you believe in what you know ?
it 's just another whistle stop .
if you do n't quit till we reach the top , i 'd be much obliged to you .
when the trolley is clean out of reach , a certain lesson it will teach .
to grind your axe until it 's dull , you 've got to get it in your skull .
tell the people all across the sea , do n't turn your back because it 's free .
it 's just another whistle stop .
if you do n't quit till we reach the top , i 'd , i 'd be much obliged to you .
and it 's odd man out .
you know that 's the rule .
you can scream and you can shout , but they 'll only call you a crazy fool .
pay no mind to what you read .
there 's one way home that 's guaranteed .
