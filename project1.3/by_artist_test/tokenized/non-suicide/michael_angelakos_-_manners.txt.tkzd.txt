make light

so now we see .
comes burying my burnt remains .
these puddled clouds .
oh i , i understand now .
but darkness falls likes shattered pieces , dangling , shimmering , torn and tattered and crowned .
oh , i 'll not be told "no " to no more .
you must believe to hear me sing these messy morsels of my self-assuring love .
oh , it 's painful kneading .
yes , i lie and i wrangle with prospective angles that glare me down and face me with all i do wrong .
why do they all look like me ?
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh just to prove i 'm alive .
and it 's alright because tonight there 's a way i 'll make light of my treacherous life .
if i had hands , i 'd hold up high my lofty dreams , my alibi 's real name .
but i have no strength .
so i toss and i turn and i spit in the urn .
there 's a ghost in your eye .
there is someone that knows more than i .
but i 'm quick to deny .
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh just to prove i 'm alive .
and it 's alright because tonight there 's a way i 'll make light of my treacherous life .
make light !

#little secrets

when i came down , the dawn poured into me .
i shook them up , the walls came crumbling , my thin skin trembling with these salty wounds , my stolen gold inside the emperor 's tomb .
now painting rainbows on my ugly face .
i built this cardboard neighborhood 's disgrace .
but i ascend and serve my feverish need within the confines of such chemistry .
it 's the way i see everything i need .
it 's no way to be .
let this be our little secret .
no one needs to know we 're feeling higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me .
up and up we keep on climbing , higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
my face blew up at such a casual sight , the smattered colors of ecstatic fright , the rush above me to oblivion , outlining wet sidewalks in halogen .
oh , have you ever felt so goddamn strong ?
how come it takes some people so damn long ?
he turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain .
the citrus drawing out the scene in stains .
watch the basin drain as your life lines wane and you ca n't explain as your friends complain .
you 've caused all this pain and you proudly shame your whole family 's name .
let this be our little secret .
no one needs to know we 're feeling higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me .
up and up we keep on climbing , higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
mother , i can tell what you 've been thinking , staring at the stars on your ceiling , thinking once there was a power that you were wielding .
but now i 've hit the mark , stabbing at the dark , and i cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars .
let this be our little secret .
no one needs to know we 're feeling higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me .
up and up we keep on climbing , higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .

#moth 's wings

dear friend , as you know your flowers are withering , your mother 's gone insane , your leaves have drifted away , but the clouds are clearing up and i 've come reveling , burning incandescently like a bastard on the burning sea .
you 're just like your father , buried deep under the water .
you 're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes .
whose side are you on ?
what side is this anyway ?
put down your sword and crown .
come lay with me on the ground .
you come beating like moth 's wings , spastic and violently , whipping me into a storm , shaking me down to the core , but you run away from me and you left me shimmering like diamond wedding rings spinning dizzily down on the floor .
you 're just like your father , buried deep under the water .
you 're resting on your laurels and stepping on my toes .
whose side are you on ?
what side is this anyway ?
put down your sword and crown .
come lay with me on the ground .

# the reeling

we dug these holes we crawled into .
now they 're my home .
now here i cannot feel the wind , ca n't feel the rain , oh , no , and i believe in gentle harmony .
well , how i loathe all this obscenity .
is this the way my life has got to be ?
have i a single opportunity ?
look at me , oh , look at me .
is this the way i 'll always be ?
oh , no , oh , no .
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me .
oh , no , oh , no .
every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day .
oh , no , oh , no .
here i am , oh , here i am .
oh , when will someone understand ?
oh , no , oh , no .
and all at once i feel this .
oh , how it clings to me .
it reels and calls me towards it , confounding destiny .
and i can feel the madness inch by inch .
the more i run the more i am convinced .
a color all these like the branches glimpse just like the saddle in the foggy mist .
look at me , oh , look at me .
is this the way i 'll always be ?
oh , no , oh , no .
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me .
oh , no , oh , no .
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day .
oh , no , oh , no .
here i am , oh , here i am .
oh , when will someone understand ?
oh , no , oh , no .
look at me , oh , look at me .
is this the way i 'll always be ?
oh ,no , oh , no .
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me .
oh , no , oh , no .
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day .
oh , no , oh , no .
here i am , oh , here i am .
oh , when will someone understand ?
oh , no , oh , no .

#eyes as candles

my world is stirring sickly .
spits out our voices singing , "oh , no , no" .
to kingdom come so slightly .
here in the void in your place , i twitch and tweak an illusion to sit and stare so blankly until our hope is used up .
why do i always seem to need you when you 're fleeing ?
where do you go when i 'm around ?
what have i done ?
what have i lost that 's so defeating ?
and have the nerve to wear a crown ?
oh , hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
some unguarded room .
a smoky figure fills me full , makes my head swell and ruin .
the family kneels at the pew .
they nod .
' we believe in what you 're doing ' .
i feel you rise above me , the western landscape 's towering , and from my shell of a body the flowers blossom for picking .
why do i always seem to need you when you 're fleeing ?
where do you go when i 'm around ?
what have i done ?
what have i got that 's so defeating ?
and have the nerve to wear a crown ?
oh , hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
i 've waited and waited for someone to take it
do n't fight it .
do n't bother an inch for another .
do n't listen .
do n't hear them .
they 're in this together .
i 've learned well .
now hear me .
there 's much to be fearing .
i 'm used to your absence , your faceless distraction .
i 've painted your patterns , but found them attractive .
now i 've been leaning towards a life far more candid , though led through the dark with your eyes as my candles , where your life and my life 's directions can wrangle and all of a sudden you 've left me to handle the reasons that never forbid me to stand tall and somehow , oh , somehow i found out the secret to staying alive without actually breathing .

#swimming in the flood

my eyes have once again been proven wrong .
your clouds , your blanket , and my pity song , hovering on your front lawn , carry on until it 's gone .
what can i do ?
the river 's overrun .
we 're swimming in a flood , you know ?
i thought i felt your touch , but the water 's rising up .
then i lie naked in a rampage in the flesh , face to face with the onset .
i forget everything that 's ever made me .
rise again .
now slowly leave my memory .
what can i do ?
the river 's overrun .
we 're swimming in a flood , you know ?
i thought i felt your touch , but the water 's rising up .
now all my lovers raise their cups .
what can i do ?
the river 's overrun .

#folds in your hands

leave me alone , leave me alone , leave me alone .
i 'm fine .
i 'll be fine until the morning comes , then unmask me in the blistering sun .
oh , let me go , just let me go , just let me go or i 'll burst in front of your eyes , then collect myself from the ground .
and when i go , and when i go , just let me go like a light , flickering out in the skies , lost as fast as was found .
everything 's easy when you never have to choose .
with the balances shifting it refers to you .
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom .
i will crush our love , let it burn until i get to you .
lay low .
do n't let me know what is real .
we 'll be quietly following you .
will they take me as their own ?
now i will hold you .
i will keep you up and show my love until it folds in my hands , but i 'll build it back to the top .
everything 's easy when you never have to choose .
with the balances shifting it refers to you .
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom .
i will crush our love , let it burn until i get to you .
feel it rain , feel it rain , my love , feel it rain .

# to kingdom come

that 's a frosty way to speak , o tell me how to live next to your potpourri .
all this talking pulls my teeth .
i believed in you , so you believed in me .
i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
once i had a name to claim .
i scraped on the walls like an orthodox saint .
i wish for the same old things that turn me inside out .
hearing is the strain .
it 's a game .
me , i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
never have i ever been clutching at your hair to cure you of some sin , but that 's the kind of state i 'm in , swimming in a pool of godly medicine .
" come , come , " i hear it calling me , yelling like if ever there was someone who could make things heavenly again .
feel alive .
me , i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
me , i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .

#let your love grow tall

in pastures blue and green i 'll follow you and you 'll follow me , my fabric 's mystery .
i 'll wave your loyalty in the freezing breeze so desperately .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
i think i see my life .
he bows all slyly and gentle-like .
he 's never had the right .
i 've never lived without his sad and jealous eyes .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
they 'd say , "let your love grow tall , let your love grow tall" .
tall as the grass in the meadow ?
or the dunes on the shore ?
like the buildings in the city ?
and your children on the floor ?
like the darkness in the forest ?
like my frightened worried eyes ?
or the roots in the soil ?
are skies telling lies ?
but it 's the thought that counts .
quiet minds do n't know their worth .
they know what to do , so i 'll pray for them and i 'll pray for you till my face turns blue .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
they 'd say , "let your love grow tall , let your love grow tall" .
tall as the grass in the meadow ?
or the dunes on the shore ?
like the buildings in the city ?
and your children on the floor ?
like the darkness in the forest ?
like my frightened worried eyes ?
or the roots in the soil ?
are skies telling lies ?

#seaweed song

some day you 'll see , surrounded by angels , floating atop of the sea .
abandon me .
do n't go where they go .
do n't sing all the songs they sing .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do . but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
between these walls her back , strange glimpse , casts shadows frighteningly tall .
i slow to a crawl .
i jump and i yell , but she hears nothing at all .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , ut i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
stay , stay the same beause everything else will change and i 've always been to blame , so please just stay the same .
the currents pull me in .
the tide has reached my chin .
the seaweed tickles skin .
just let the water win .
i 'm freezing to the bone .
you 'll never be at home .
just watch , you 're running out .
just watch your body go .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
