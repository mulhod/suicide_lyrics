heart of gold

i want to live .
i want to give .
i 've been a miner for a heart of gold .
it 's these expressions i never give that keep me searching for a heart of gold and i 'm getting old , keeps me searching for a heart of gold and i 'm getting old .
i 've been to hollywood .
i 've been to redwood .
i crossed the ocean for a heart of gold .
i 've been in my mind .
it 's such a fine line that keeps me searching for a heart of gold and i 'm getting old , keeps me searching for a heart of gold and i 'm getting old .
keep me searching for a heart of gold .
you keep me searching for a heart of gold and i 'm growing old .
i 've been a miner for a heart of gold .

#old man

old man , look at my life i 'm a lot like you were .
old man , look at my life , i 'm a lot like you were .
old man , look at my life , twenty-four and there 's so much more .
live alone in a paradise that makes me think of two .
love lost , such a cost , give me things that do n't get lost , like a coin that wo n't get tossed rolling home to you .
old man , take a look at my life , i 'm a lot like you .
i need someone to love me the whole day through .
ah , one look in my eyes and you can tell that 's true .
lullabies , look in your eyes , run around the same old town .
does n't mean that much to me to mean that much to you .
i 've been first and last .
look at how the time goes past .
but i 'm all alone at last , rolling home to you .
old man , take a look at my life , i 'm a lot like you .
i need someone to love me the whole day through .
ah , one look in my eyes and you can tell that 's true .
old man , look at my life , i 'm a lot like you were .
old man look at my life , i 'm a lot like you were .

# the needle and the damage done

i caught you knocking at my cellar door .
i love you , baby .
can i have some more ?
ooh , ooh , the damage done .
i hit the city and i lost my band .
i watched the needle take another man .
gone , gone , the damage done .
i sing the song because i love the man .
i know that some of you do n't understand .
milk blood to keep from running out .
i 've seen the needle and the damage done , a little part of it in everyone .
but every junkie 's like a setting sun .

#going back

in a foreign land there were creatures at play , running hand in hand , needing nowhere to stay , driven to the mountains high , they were sunken in the cities deep , living in my sleep.
i feel like going back , back where there 's nowhere to stay , when fire filled the sky .
i 'll still remember that day .
these rocks i 'm climbing down have already left the ground , careening through space .
i used to build these buildings .
i used to walk next to you .
their shadows tore us apart and now we do what we do .
driven to the mountains high , sunken in the cities deep , living in our sleep.
i feel like going back , back where there 's nowhere to stay .

#comes a time

comes a time when you 're drifting , comes a time when you settle down .
comes a light , feelings lifting .
lift that baby right up off the ground .
oh , this old world keeps spinning around .
it 's a wonder tall trees ai n't laying down .
there comes a time .
you and i , we were captured .
we took our souls and we flew away .
we were right , we were giving .
that 's how we kept what we gave away .
oh , this old world keeps spinning around .
it 's a wonder tall trees ai n't laying down .
there comes a time .

#look out for my love

there 's a lot to learn for wasting time .
there 's a heart that burns .
there 's an open mind .
look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love .
you own it , you own it now .
you own it .
there 's a weight on you , but you ca n't feel it .
living like i do , it 's hard for you to see it .
was i hurt too bad ?
can i show you daylight ?
how could i be sad when i know that you might ?
look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love .
look out for my love .
it 's in your neighborhood .
i know things are going to change , but i ca n't say bad or good .
silver wings of morning shining in the gray day while the ice is forming on a lonely runway .
hydraulic wipers pumping till the window glistens .
something saying something .
no one seems to listen .
men with walkie-talkies , men with flashlights waving .
up upon the tower time reads daylight savings .
i 'm home again to you , babe .
you know it makes me wonder , sitting in the quiet slipstream in the thunder .
look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love , look out for my love .

#unknown legend

she used to work in a diner .
never saw a woman look finer .
i used to order just to watch her float across the floor .
she grew up in a small town , never put her roots down .
daddy always kept moving , so she did too .
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley-davidson , her long blonde hair flying in the wind .
she 's been running half her life , the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes , the air she breathes .
you know it ai n't easy .
you got to hold on .
she was an unknown legend in her time .
now she 's dressing two kids , looking for a magic kiss .
she gets the far-away look in her eyes .
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley-davidson , her long blonde hair flying in the wind .
she 's been running half her life , the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes , the air she breathes .

#from hank to hendrix

from hank to hendrix i walked these streets with you .
here i am with this old guitar , doing what i do .
i always expected that you would see me through .
i never believed in much , but i believed in you .
can we get it together ?
can we still stand side by side ?
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?
from marilyn to madonna i always loved your smile .
now we 're headed for the big divorce , california-style .
i found myself singing like a long-lost friend .
the same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end .
can we get it together ?
can we still stand side by side ?
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?
sometime it 's distorted , not clear to you
sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringing through .
new glass in the window , new leaf on the tree , new distance between us , you and me .
can we get it together ?
can we still walk side by side ?
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?

#harvest moon

come a little bit closer , hear what i have to say .
just like children sleepinh , we could dream this night away .
but there 's a full moon rising .
let 's go dancing in the light .
we know where the music 's playing .
let 's go out and feel the night because i 'm still in love with you .
i want to see you dance again because i 'm still in love with you on this harvest moon .
when we were strangers , i watched you from afar .
when we were lovers , i loved you with all my heart .
but now it 's getting late and the moon is climbing high .
i want to celebrate , see it shining in your eye , because i 'm still in love with you .
i want to see you dance again , because i 'm still in love with you on this harvest moon .

#dreaming man

i 'm a dreaming man , yes , that 's my problem .
i ca n't tell when i 'm not being real .
in the meadow dusk i park my aerostar with a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you .
i 'll always be a dreaming man .
i do n't have to understand .
i know it 's alright .
i see your curves and i feel your vibrations , you dressed in black and white , you lost in the mall .
i watch you disappear past club med vacations .
another sleepless night , a sun that wo n't fall .
i 'll always be a dreaming man .
i do n't have to understand .
i know it 's alright .
now the night is gone , a new day is dawning , and our homeless dreams go back to the street .
another time or place , another civilization would really make this life feel so complete .
i 'll always be a dreaming man .
i do n't have to understand .
i know it 's alright .
dreaming man , he 's got a problem .
dreaming man , dreaming man , he 's got a problem .
dreaming man .
