imagine

imagine there 's no heaven .
it 's easy if you try .
no hell below us , above us only sky .
imagine all the people living for today .
imagine there 's no countries .
it is n't hard to do .
nothing to kill or die for , and no religion too .
imagine all the people living life in peace .
you may say i 'm a dreamer , but i 'm not the only one .
i hope someday you 'll join us , and the world will be as one .
imagine no possessions .
i wonder if you can .
no need for greed or hunger , a brotherhood of man .
imagine all the people sharing all the world .
you may say i 'm a dreamer , but i 'm not the only one .
i hope someday you 'll join us , and the world will live as one .

#cold turkey

temperature 's rising , fever is high .
ca n't see no future .
ca n't see no sky .
my feet are so heavy , so is my head .
i wish i was a baby .
i wish i was dead .
cold turkey has got me on the run .
body is aching , goose pimple bone .
ca n't see no body .
leave me alone .
my eyes are wide open .
ca n't get to sleep.
one thing i 'm sure of , i 'm at the deep freeze .
cold turkey has got me on the run .
cold turkey has got me on the run .
thirty-six hours rolling in pain .
praying to someone .
free me again .
oh , i 'll be a good boy .
please make me well .
i promise you anything .
get me out of this hell .

#nobody told me

everybody 's talking , and no one says a word .
everybody 's making love , and no one really cares .
there 's nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs .
always something happening and nothing going on .
there 's always something cooking and nothing in the pot .
they 're starving back in china , so finish what you got .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
strange days indeed , strange days indeed .
everybody 's running , and no one makes a move .
everyone 's a winner , and nothing left to lose .
there 's a little yellow idol to the north of kathmandu .
everybody 's flying , and no one leaves the ground .
everybody 's crying , and no one makes a sound .
there 's a place for us in the movies you just got to lay around .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
strange days indeed , most peculiar , mama .
everybody 's smoking , and no one 's getting high .
everybody 's flying , and never touch the sky .
there 's a ufo over new york , and i ai n't too surprised .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
strange days indeed , most peculiar , mama .

#working class hero

as soon as you 're born , they make you feel small by giving you no time instead of it all till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all .
a working-class hero is something to be .
they hurt you at home , and they hit you at school .
they hate you if you 're clever , and they despise a fool till you 're so fucking crazy , you ca n't follow their rules .
a working-class hero is something to be .
when they 've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years , then they expect you to pick a career .
when you ca n't really function , you 're so full of fear , a working class hero is something to be .
keep you doped with religion and sex and tv , and you think you 're so clever and classless and free , but you 're still fucking peasants as far as i can see .
a working-class hero is something to be .
there 's room at the top , they 're telling you still , but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill .
a working-class hero is something to be .
if you want to be a hero , well , just follow me .

#crippled inside

you can shine your shoes and wear a suit .
you can comb your hair and look quite cute .
you can hide your face behind a smile .
one thing you ca n't hide is when you 're crippled inside .
you can wear a mask and paint your face .
you can call yourself the human race .
you can wear a collar and a tie .
one thing you ca n't hide is when you 're crippled inside .
well , now , you know that your cat has nine lives , nine lives to itself , but you only got one and a dog 's life ai n't fun .
mama , take a look outside .
you can go to church and sing a hymn .
you can judge me by the color of my skin .
you can live a lie until you die .
one thing you ca n't hide is when you 're crippled inside .

#how do you sleep ?

so sergeant pepper took you by surprise .
you better see right through that mother 's eyes .
those freaks was right when they said you was dead .
the one mistake you made was in your head .
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
you live with straights who tell you you was king , jump when your mama tell you anything .
the only thing you done was yesterday and , since you 're gone , you 're just another day .
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
a pretty face may last a year or two , but pretty soon they 'll see what you can do .
the sound you make is muzak to my ears .
you must have learned something in all those years .
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?

#mind games

we 're playing those mind games together , pushing the barriers , planting seeds , playing the mind guerrilla , chanting the mantra peace on earth .
we all been playing those mind games forever , some kind of druid dudes lifting the veil , doing the mind guerrilla .
some call it magic , the search for the grail .
love is the answer and you know that for sure .
love is a flower .
you got to let it grow .
so keep on playing those mind games together , faith in the future out of the now .
you just ca n't beat on those mind guerrillas , absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind .
yeah , we 're playing those mind games together , projecting our images in space and in time .
yes is the answer and you know that for sure .
yes is surrender .
you got to let it go .
so keep on playing those mind games together , doing the ritual dance in the sun , millions of mind guerrillas putting their soul power to the karmic wheel .
keep on playing those mind games together , raising the spirit of peace and love .
i want you to make love , not war .
i know you 've heard it before .

#i know ( i know )

the years have passed so quickly .
one thing i 've understood : i am only learning to tell the trees from wood .
i know what 's coming down and i know where it 's coming from and i know and i 'm sorry , yes , i am , but i never could speak my mind .
and i know just how you feel and i know now what i have done and i know and i 'm guilty , but i never could speak my mind .
i know what i was missing , but now my eyes can see .
i put myself in your place as you did for me .
today i love you more than yesterday .
right now i love you more right now .
now i know what 's coming down .
i can feel where it 's coming from and i know it 's getting better all the time as we share in each other 's minds .

#you are here

from distant lands , one woman , one man .
let the four winds blow .
three thousand miles over the ocean , three thousand light-years from the land of the rising sun .
love has opened up my eyes .
love has blown right through .
wherever you are , you are here .
wherever you are , you are here .
three thousand miles over the ocean , three thousand light-years from the land of the surprising sun .
well , now , east is east and west is west .
the twain shall meet .
east is west and west is east .
let it be complete .
three thousand miles over the ocean , three thousand light-years from the land of the morning star .

#going down on love

got to get down , down on my knees .
got to get down , down on my knees .
going down on love .
going down on love .
going down , going down , going down .
when the real thing goes wrong and you ca n't get it on and your love , she has gone and you got to carry on and you shoot out the light , ai n't coming home for the night , you know you got to , got to , got to pay the price .
somebody please , please help me .
you know i 'm drowning in the sea of hatred .
got to get down , down on my knees .
got to get down , down on my knees .
going down on love .
going down on love .
going down , going down , going down .
something precious and rare disappears in thin air and it seems so unfair .
nothing doing nowhere .
well , you burn all your boats and you sow your wild oats .
well , you know , you know , you know the price is right !

#surprise , surprise ( sweet bird of paradox )

sweet as the smell of success , her body 's warm and wet .
she gets me through this god-awful loneliness , a natural high butterfly , oh i , i need , need , need her .
just like a willow tree , a breath of spring , you see , and , oh , boy , you do n't know what she do to me .
she makes me sweat and forget who i am .
i need , need , need , need her .
well , i was wondering how long this could go on , on and on .
well , i thought i could never be surprised .
but could it be that i bit my own tongue ?
oh , yeah , it 's so hard to swallow when you 're wrong .
a bird of paradise , the sunrise in her eyes .
god only knows such a sweet surprise .
i was blind .
she blew my mind .
think that i , i love , love , love , love , love her .
i love her , i love her , i love her , i love her .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
