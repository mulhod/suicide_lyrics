i am the cosmos

every night i tell myself : "i am the cosmos , i am the wind , " but that do n't get you back again .
just when i was starting to feel okay , you 're on the phone .
i never want to be alone never want to be alone .
i hate to have to take you home .
wanted too much to say no , no .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , never want to be alone .
i hate to have to take you home .
want you too much to say no , no .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , my feeling 's always happening , something i could n't hide .
i ca n't confide .
do n't know what 's going on inside .
so every night i tell myself : "i am the cosmos , i am the wind , " but that do n't get you back again .
i 'd really like to see you again .
i really want to see you again .
i 'd really like to see you again .
i really want to see you again .
i 'd really like to see you again .
i really want to see you again .
i never want to see you again .
really want to see you again .

#better save yourself

i 'm off the street .
i 'm all alone .
i just ca n't think what i 've been doing wrong .
i know you 're mine .
he treats you nice .
it 's suicide .
i know , i tried it twice .
you should 've given your love to jesus .
it could n't do you no harm .
should 've given your love to jesus .
it would n't do you no harm .
you 've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace , but you better save yourself if you want to see his face .
i guess there are things you 'd like to know .
it 's getting late , and i know you want to go .
you should 've given your love to jesus .
it could n't do you no harm .
should 've given your love to jesus .
it would n't do you no harm .
you 've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace , but you better save yourself if you want to see his face .
i 'm off the street .
i 'm all alone .
i just ca n't think what i 've been doing wrong .

#speed of sound

i remember the first time you said you loved me .
i waited all weekend .
you never called me .
so you find him attractive .
so what if he is ?
you 'd like some excitement .
you could count his same kiss .
so it goes on and on .
my love grows and yours is gone .
a lonely existence , well it 's just a lie .
if there is a reason , i 'd like to know why .
something i want you to know : i 've told you this once before , do n't want you to see him no more .
once again you 've let me down , broke my heart , and turned me around .
there 's a light in the darkness .
it does n't seem far .
is something the matter that 's brought us ajar ?
the plane goes down , will not land .
pilot 's dead .
nowhere to be found .

#get away

i know what it is you 're thinking , but baby , it 's sacred to me .
whenever i feel like i 'm sinking , you make a beautiful scene .
you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
baby , i 'm feeling low .
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
do n't know what you 're putting me through .
once in a while you 're lonely .
if you feel lonely , cry .
i 'd love to know what is the matter , unless you 're with some other guy , because you do n't lie to me and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
baby , i 'm feeling low .
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
do you want to ?
i want you .
do you want to ?
i want you too .
do n't you know i 'm losing sleep at night , sleep at night ?
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i know what it is you 're thinking , but baby , it 's strange to me .
whenever i feel like i 'm sinking , you make a beautiful scene .
do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
and , baby , i 'm feeling low .
do n't know what i 'm going to do .
do n't know what you 're putting me through .

#you and your sister

they say my love for you ai n't real , but they do n't know how real it feels .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
your sister says that i 'm no good .
you know i 'd show her them if i could .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
love you every day .
let me hear you say your love wo n't be leaving .
your eyes ai n't deceiving .
love you every day .
let me hear you say : all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
and let me whisper in your ear : do n't you worry , they ca n't hear .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .
if you give me a little time , i will show you i ai n't lying .
all i want to do is to spend some time with you so i can hold you , hold you .

#make a scene

you hurt me yesterday .
i did n't know what to say .
you did n't have to be so mean .
you did n't have to make a scene .
you do n't have to be so cruel .
you made me feel like a fool .
i heard some things about you .
they said you was untrue .
i told them .
then why is it so ?
you hurt me yesterday .
i did n't know what to say .
you did n't have to be so mean .
you did n't have to make a scene .
you do n't have to act so cool .
i know that you 've been to school .
i started to feel unloved .
i had no place to go .
i turned on the radio .
you hurt me yesterday .
i did n't know what to say .
you did n't have to be so mean .
you did n't have to make a scene .
do n't have to be so cruel .
made me feel like a fool .
i heard some things about you .
they said you was untrue .
i told them .
then why is it so ?

#look up

look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
look up .
look up .
he 's the life waiting to love you , wanting to reach you .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
the man walking down the street keeps his head down low .
does n't look up , wants to give up .
he just keeps on looking down , staring at the ground .
standing here at the corner i 'm watching him walk away .
standing here and i do n't know why , but i 'm thinking it could be a great day .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
oh , i wish you knew him .
he 's been waiting for so long .
if you look up , you 'll see him .
you know we 're all alone .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
look up .
look up .
he 's the life waiting to love you , wanting to reach you .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .

#i got kinda lost

i got kind of lost .
i got kind of lost .
i got kind of lost in giving .
i got kind of lost .
and what can i say feeling the way i do ?
i 'm trying to get it across to you .
only wanted to be together .
all the time that it was i saw her .
things that i 'd done before are gone .
i ca n't believe i 'm on my own .
once in a while , and i see you smile , but you do n't know how it 's going .
i 'm trying to get it across to you .
only wanted to be together .
all the time that it was i saw her .
things that i 'd done before are gone .
i ca n't believe i 'm on my own .
i got kind of lost .
i got kind of lost .
i got kind of lost in giving .
i 'm trying to get it across to you .

#there was a light

there was a light so dear to me i wanted to live .
there was a time so near to me i asked you to give your life to me .
if it 's a sign sent down to me , i 'm asking you why it had to be .
spending all my time , waiting to die - what 's the use ?
there was a light so dear to me i wanted to live .
there was a time so dear to me i asked you to give your life to me .

#fight at the table

had a fight at the table .
i did n't think it would end .
i did n't think i 'd be able to go on and pretend .
i been having a good time .
i did n't want you to go , she said .
got to leave her alone .
i started dreaming about emma , and he said , "do n't interfere . "
said "what are you doing in denver ?
there no light in here " .
well , i been having a good time .
i did n't want you to go .
why ca n't they stop all this jiving ?
you do n't want to know .
it must be getting past midnight , and now i 'm staring to scream .
she really put up a good fight .
i think this must be a dream .
i been having a good time .
babe , i 'm lost in the rain .
i told them just when i 'm going .
i think i 'm going insane .

#i do n't know

whatever it is you 're thinking , sit down and let 's give it a try .
you know that i 'll always listen , but sometimes i 'm wondering why .
you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
baby i 'm feeling lost .
i do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
once in a while you 're lonely .
tell me you needed a friend .
i 'm wondering what is the matter , but you say that you ca n't explain .
but you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
but , baby , i 'm feeling lost .
i do n't know what i 'm going through .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
do you want me ?
i want you .
you do n't want me ?
i want you .
do n't you know i 'm losing sleep at night , sleep at night .
i do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
whatever it is you 're thinking , sit down and let 's give it a try .
you know that i 'll always listen , but sometimes i 'm wondering why .
you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
but , baby , i 'm feeling lost .
i do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .

# though i know she lies

when i look though your eyes , i tend to get bitter .
maybe i 'm best advised to look to myself .
i fall every time , though i know she lies .
i ca n't stay away .
stars would fall from the sky , and i wo n't forsake you .
you 've got lust in your heart .
what 's sad to me ?
i 'll use every line , anything to make you mine .
keeping me in the dark .
wondering where you are .
do n't let me fall apart .
you said take it slow , but i do n't know .
i do n't know .
lying awake in the bed trying to cope with the feelings .
i do n't know if it 's love , but what can i do ?
i fall every time , though i know she lies .
i ca n't stay away .
