the sound of silence

hello darkness , my old friend .
i 've come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping , left its seeds while i was sleeping .
and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence .
in restless dreams i walked alone , narrow streets of cobblestone .
beneath the halo of a street lamp , i turned my collar to the cold and damp .
when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence .
and in the naked light , i saw ten thousand people , maybe more .
people talking without speaking , people hearing without listening , people writing songs that voices never share .
and no one dared disturb the sound of silence .
"fools " said i ,"you do not know silence like a cancer grows .
hear my words that i might teach you .
take my arms that i might reach you " .
but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence .
and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made .
and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming .
and the signs said , 'the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whisper 'd in the sounds of silence .

#leaves that are green

i was twenty-one years when i wrote this song .
i 'm twenty-two now but i wo n't be for long .
time hurries on .
and the leaves that are green turn to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
once my heart was filled with the love of a girl .
i held her close , but she faded in the night like a poem i meant to write .
and the leaves that are green turn to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
i threw a pebble in a brook .
and watched the ripples run away .
and they never made a sound .
and the leaves that are green turn to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
hello , hello , hello , hello .
good-bye , good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
that 's all there is .
and the leaves that are green turned to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .

#blessed

blessed are the meek for they shall inherit .
blessed is the lamb whose blood flows .
blessed are the sat upon , spat upon , ratted on .
o lord , why have you forsaken me ?
i got no place to go .
i 've walked around soho for the last night or so , ah , but it does n't matter , no .
blessed is the land and the kingdom .
blessed is the man whose soul belongs to .
blessed are the meth drinkers , pot sellers , illusion dwellers .
o lord , why have you forsaken me ?
my words trickle down , from a wound that i have no intention to heal .
blessed are the stained glass , window pane glass .
blessed is the church service , makes me nervous .
blessed are the penny rookers , cheap hookers , groovy lookers .
o lord , why have you forsaken me ?
i have tended my own garden much too long .

#kathy 's song

i hear the drizzle of the rain .
like a memory it falls , soft and warm continuing , tapping on my roof and walls .
and from the shelter of my mind through the window of my eyes , i gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets to england where my heart lies .
my mind 's distracted and diffused .
my thoughts are many miles away .
they lie with you when you 're asleep and kiss you when you start your day .
and as a song i was writing is left undone , i do n't know why i spend my time writing songs i ca n't believe with words that tear and strain to rhyme .
and so you see i have come to doubt all that i once held as true .
i stand alone without beliefs .
the only truth i know is you .
and as i watch the drops of rain weave their weary paths and die .
i know that i am like the rain .
there but for the grace of you go i .

#somewhere they ca n't find me

i can hear the soft breathing of the girl that i love as she lies here beside me , asleep with the night .
her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow , reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight .
but i 've got to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway .
before they come to catch me , i 'll be gone somewhere they ca n't find me .
oh baby , you do n't know what i 've done .
i 've committed a crime , i 've broken the law .
while you were here sleeping and just dreaming of me , i held up and robbed a liquor store .
but i 've got to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway .
before they come to catch me , i 'll be gone somewhere they ca n't find me .
oh my life seems unreal , my crime an illusion , a scene badly written in which i must play .
and though it puts me uptight to leave you , i know it 's not right to leave you when morning is just a few hours away .
but i 've got to creep down the alley way , fly down the highway .
before they come to catch me , i 'll be gone somewhere they ca n't find me .

#richard cory

they say that richard cory owns one half of this whole town , with political connections to spread his wealth around .
born into society , a banker 's only child , he had everything a man could want : power , grace , and style .
but i work in his factory .
and i curse the life i 'm living .
and i curse my poverty .
and i wish that i could be , oh , i wish that i could be , oh , i wish that i could be richard cory .
the papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes : richard cory at the opera , richard cory at a show .
and the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht !
oh , he surely must be happy with everything he 's got .
but i work in his factory .
and i curse the life i 'm living .
and i curse my poverty .
and i wish that i could be , oh , i wish that i could be , oh , i wish that i could be richard cory .
he freely gave to charity .
he had the common touch .
and they were grateful for his patronage and thanked him very much .
so my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read : "richard cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head . "
but i work in his factory .
and i curse the life i 'm living .
and i curse my poverty .
and i wish that i could be , oh , i wish that i could be , oh , i wish that i could be richard cory .

# a most peculiar man

he was a most peculiar man .
that 's what mrs . riordan said and she should know ; she lived upstairs from him .
she said he was a most peculiar man .
he was a most peculiar man .
he lived all alone within a house , within a room , within himself .
a most peculiar man .
he had no friends ; he seldom spoke .
and no one in turn ever spoke to him because he was n't friendly and he did n't care , and he was n't like them .
oh , no!
he was a most peculiar man .
he died last saturday .
he turned on the gas and he went to sleep with the windows closed so he 'd never wake up to his silent world and his tiny room .
and mrs . riordan says he has a brother somewhere who should be notified soon .
and all the people said , "what a shame that he 's dead , but was n't he a most peculiar man ? "

#april come she will

april come she will when streams are ripe and swelled with rain .
may she will stay resting in my arms again .
june she 'll change her tune .
in restless walks she 'll prowl the night .
july she will fly and give no warning to her flight .
august die she must .
the autumn winds blow chilly and cold .
september i remember a love once new has now grown old .

#we 've got a groovy thing going

#i am a rock

a winter 's day in a deep and dark december , i am alone , gazing from my window to the streets below on a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow .
i am a rock .
i am an island .
i 've built walls , a fortress deep and mighty , that none may penetrate .
i have no need of friendship ; friendship causes pain .
it 's laughter and it 's loving i disdain .
i am a rock .
i am an island .
do n't talk of love , but i 've heard the word before .
it 's sleeping in my memory .
i wo n't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died .
if i never loved i never would have cried .
i am a rock .
i am an island .
i have my books and my poetry to protect me .
i am shielded in my armor , hiding in my room , safe within my womb .
i touch no one and no one touches me .
i am a rock ,
i am an island .
and a rock feels no pain .
and an island never cries .
