#Lonesome Suzie

Lonesome Suzie never got the breaks.
She's always losing and so she sits and cries and shakes.
It's hard just to watch her and, if I touch her , oh, poor Suzie, I'm wondering what to do .
She just sits there hoping for a friend  .
I don't fit here, but I may have a friend to lend  .
Maybe I mistook her, but I can't overlook her  .
Must be someone who can pull her through.
Anyone who's felt that bad could tell me what to say . 
Even if she just got mad she might be better off that way .
And where is all the understanding?
Her problems can't be that demanding  .
Why is it she looks my way every time she starts to cry?
Lonesome Suzie, I can't watch you cry no longer , if you can use me until you feel a little stronger  .
I guess just watching you has made me lonesome too  .
Why don't we get together?
what else can we do?
