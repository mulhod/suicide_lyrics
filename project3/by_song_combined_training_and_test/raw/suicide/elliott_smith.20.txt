#Alphabet Town

alphabet city is haunted.
constantina feels right at home.
she probably won't say you're wrong, but you're already wrong, you're already wrong, and you threw up whatever she shot down, said show me around this alphabet town, said show me around.
there's a name you keep repeating.
you got nothing better to do and you're with someone who'll hear you say it and just not mind.
her hand on your arm, her hand on your arm, she put her hand on your arm and told you her name.
you can't pronounce it.
i'll show you around this alphabet town.
i'll show you around this alphabet town.
i know what you are.
i just don't mind.
i won't say you're wrong.
i know what you want and it's what i want.
so let's go out.
i'm ready to go out.
i'll show you around this alphabet town.
i'll show you around this alphabet town.
