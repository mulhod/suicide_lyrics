#Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid.
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking wherever you get your way.
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me.
this is starting to sound the same.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
In her false witness, we hope you're still with us to see if they float or drown.
Our favorite patient, a display of patience, disease-covered Puget Sound.
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars and leave a blanket of ash on the ground.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid.
It's so relaxing to know that you're asking wherever you get your way.
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me.
this is starting to sound the same.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
