#Big Decision

pick me up in an hour or so.
i don't really recommend it, no.
they'll probably just put you down.
i believe you.
i want to be you.
i believe you.
i want to be you.
i know you're not through with it yet.
it's a big decision.
you can't kick when you're down.
got a feeling kind of like a cough.
be not nothing going to shake it off, be not nothing going to shake it off until you talk out loud.
i believe you.
i want to be you.
i believe you.
i want to be you.
i know you're not through with it yet.
it's a big decision.
you can't kick when you're down.
the chromium car reflects you are.
taking you home, i'm under your spell.
can't you tell?
don't you know?
god, people wonder if you're sick, spilled out on the city slick, buffed up like a macho jerk.
don't even try it.
it'll never work.
why, you wonder?
what, you wonder, for me?
why, you wonder?
what, you wonder, for me?
why you want what i can not be?
you know i won't stay sober.
i believe you.
i want to be you.
i believe you.
i want to be you.
i know you're not through with it yet.
it's a big decision.
i know you're not through with it yet.
it's a big decision.
i know you're not through with it yet.
it's a big decision.
you can't kick when you're down.
