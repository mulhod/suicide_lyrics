#Talking Vietnam

Sailing over to Vietnam, Southeast Asian Birmingham.
Well, training is the word we use.
Nice word to have in case we lose.
Training a million Vietnamese to fight for the wrong government and the American Way.
Well, they put me in a barracks house just across the way from Laos.
They said you're pretty safe when the troops deploy, but don't turn your back on your house, boy.
When they ring the gong, watch out for the Viet-Cong.
Well, the sergeant said it's time to train, so I climbed aboard my helicopter plane.
We flew above the battle-ground.
A sniper tried to shoot us down.
He must have forgotten we're only trainees.
Them Commies never fight fair.
Friends, the very next day we trained some more.
We burned some villages down to the floor.
Yes, we burned out the jungles far and wide.
Made sure those red apes had no place left to hide.
Threw all the people in relocation camps under lock and key.
made damn sure they're free.
Well, I walked through the jungle and around the bend.
Who should I meet but President Diem.
Said you're fighting to keep Vietnam free for good old Diem-ocracy.
That means rule by one family and 15,000 American troops, give or take a few.
Thousand American troops.
