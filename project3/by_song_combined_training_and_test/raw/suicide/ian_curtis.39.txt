#Interzone

I walked through the city limits.
Someone talked me in to do it.
attracted by some force within it, fad to close my eyes to get close to it.
Around a corner where a prophet lay, saw the place where she had a room to stay, a wire fence where the children played.
Saw the bed where the body lay and I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.
The cars screeched.
hear the sound on dust.
Heard a noise. just a car outside, metallic blue turned red with rust.
Pulled in close by the building's side in a group, all forgotten youth.
Had to think, collect.
my senses now are turned onto a knife-edged view.
Find some places where my friends don't know.
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.
Down the dark streets the houses looked the same.
Getting darker now.
faces look the same.
And I walked around and around.
No stomach.
torn apart.
Nail me to a train.
Had to think again.
Trying to find a clue.
trying to find a way to get out!
Trying to move away.
had to move away and keep out.
Four, twelve windows, ten in a row, behind a wall.
well, I looked down low.
The lights shined like a neon show.
inserted deep.
felt a warmer glow.
No place to stop.
no place to go.
no time to lose.
had to keep on going.
I guessed they died some time ago.
I guessed they died some time ago.
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.
