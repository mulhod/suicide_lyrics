#In the Lost and Found (Honky Bach)

he held his breath to hold your hand, to walk the stairsteps in pairs, climbing up a slippery slope.
i'm in love, love i hope.
don't go home, angelina.
stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found.
kissed you quick, feeling weird, lonely, leered, and disappeared.
this is such a simple place passing time can't erase.
don't go home, angelina.
paint tomorrow blue.
day breaks and every morning, when he wakes, he thinks of you.
i'm alone.
that's okay.
i don't mind.
most of the time i don't feel afraid to die.
she was here passing by.
don't go home, angelina.
stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found.
stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found.
