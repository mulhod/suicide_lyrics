#The Ballad of Henry & Susannah, Pt. 2

So his father with a band went out when all lay sound asleep into a house in Alburgh town those desperate men did creep.
Young Henry he went with them, having reached his nineteenth year.
His part it was to stand a watch and see the coast was clear.
But fortune was not with that band, kind favor passed them by, for the constables they soon did come and did raise the hue and cry.
They was quickly overtaken and carried to the jail for to wring their hands and curse their fate until their strength did fail.
It was at Thetford assizes at the bar they soon did stand, and the sentence it was given that all three of them should hang.
But up spoke Henry's mother, crying, "Spare my only son, for his years are few, and for one crime his race should not be run."
Fourteen years of transportation became Henry's punishment, and to the cells of Norwich Castle this young man was sent.
Leaving his tender mother for to tear her hair in woe as her husband and Abe Carman to the gallows-tree did go.
