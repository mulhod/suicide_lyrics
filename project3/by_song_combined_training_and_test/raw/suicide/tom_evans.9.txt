#Blind Owl 

Lies, ties, Mr. Cool disguise.
Hang it up.
Get up on your own.
Pill-driven skills, weeping Whip-poor-wills.
Too much going around that you can't hide.
Look out for the blind owl.
You can only find that you were wrong.
No one else around me ever loved me like you do, so I'll be strong.
Look out for the blind owl.
You can only find that you were wrong.
No one else around me ever loved me like you do, so I'll be strong.
Days, plays, interviewer's maze.
Play the role.
Sell your soul.
Becoming to yourself, a hero who must never lie.
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
