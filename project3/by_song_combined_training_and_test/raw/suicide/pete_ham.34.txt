#Meanwhile Back at the Ranch

Why do you think me so hard to get?
Is there something they might regret?
Is it better to just forget, just forget?
If they only would let us know, then we'd know just how far to go, but instead they just tell us "no", tell us "no".
You, you always played the fool.
you always played the fool.
You always break the rule at every single school, you know.
you always break the rule.
It always pulled you down.
They could always pull you down.
You, you never stayed the same.
you never stayed the same and now you take the blame for all the little games they play.
you always take the blame and let it bring you down.
Why'd you let it bring you down?
