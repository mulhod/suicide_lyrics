I feel a change coming on.
a frame of mind that's held me down for too long, tried to imprison my soul, locked me outside of my own Rock-n-Roll.
Can you feel it?
Oh, yeah.
Can you feel the change?
It's coming.
Feel it, oh, yeah.
Feel the change.
it's coming my way, yeah.
I see a light from a night, a distant star, but it's shining so bright, guiding me out of myself.
This newfound love has got me under its spell.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah.
Can you see the light?
It's coming.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah.
Can you see the light?
It's coming today.
For years and years I've waited so long.
I almost lost control.
The days and nights all seemed to be wrong without you, little Miss Rock-N-Roll.
You know I tell you no lie.
My little lady, lift me up to the sky.
She put the stomp on my blues.
She blow the dust off my old blue suede shoes.
Feel it, oh, yeah.
Can you feel the change?
It's coming.
Can you feel it?
Yeah.
Can you feel the change?
It's coming my way, yeah.
