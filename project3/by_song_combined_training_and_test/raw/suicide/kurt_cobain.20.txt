#Very Ape

I am buried up to my neck in contradictionary flies.
I take pride as the king of illiterature.
I'm very ape and very nice.
If you ever need anything, please don't desitate to ask someone else first.
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive.
I've seen it all.
I was here first.
Out of the ground, into the sky.
out of the sky, into the dirt.
