#Endless, Nameless

Silence, here I am, here I am, silent.
Bright and clear, it's what I am.
I have died.
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
Mother.
Death with violence.
Excitement right here.
Died.
Go to hell.
Here I am, right here.
Ow!
Death is what I am.
Go to hell.
Go to jail.
In back of that crime.
Here I am.
Take a chance.
Dead!
Die!
