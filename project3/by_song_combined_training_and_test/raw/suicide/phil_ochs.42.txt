#In the Heat of the Summer

In the heat of the summer, when the pavements were burning, the soul of a city was ravaged in the night after the city sun was sinking.
Why, the windows were shattered, but deep in the dark someone set the spark and then it no longer mattered.
All the tempers were raging.
Oh, where, oh, where are the white silver tongues who forgot to listen to the warnings?
No longer following reason and all the stores were the target now where just the other day they were buying.
Drunk with the lure of the looting and the memory of the uniforms shoving with their sticks, asking, "Are you looking for trouble?"
"It's not the way of the order.
Oh, stay in your homes.
please leave us alone.
We'll be glad to talk in the morning."
"Why the hurry to your hunger?
Now the rubble's resting on your broken streets, so you see what your rage has unraveled".
Bricks were heavily flying and the loudspeaker drowned like a whispering sound when compared to the angered emotions.
And the shame was replacing the anger, so wrong, so wrong, but we've been down so long and we had to make somebody listen in the heat of the summer.
