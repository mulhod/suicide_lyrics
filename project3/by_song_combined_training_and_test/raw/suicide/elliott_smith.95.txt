#Oh Well Okay

here's the silhouette, the face always turned away, the bleeding color gone to black, dying like a day.
couldn't figure out what made you so unhappy.
shook your head to say no, no, no and stopped for a spell and stayed that way.
oh, well, okay.
i got pictures.
i just don't see it anymore.
climbing hour upon hour through a total bore with the one i keep where it never fades in the safety of a pitch-black mind, an airless cell that blocks the day.
oh, well, okay.
if you a get a feeling the next time you see me, do me a favor and let me know because it's hard to tell, it's hard to say.
oh, well, okay.
oh, well, okay.
oh, well, okay.
