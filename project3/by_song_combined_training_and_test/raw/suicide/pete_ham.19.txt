#Midnight Caller

Beneath the midnight caller she thinks of paper green.
You never hear them calling her name.
They just know where they've been.
You never hear her holler.
The tears no longer come.
She reads her daily book of the past that shows of everyone.
Grey years that show in her hair.
Can't be, but don't seem to care.
She unlocks the door and there's no one there.
She sees a daytime stroller walk from the night before and, though she paints a smile on her face, he won't be back no more.
She's got no saint to follow.
She's got no place to go.
Too proud to ask an old friend for help.
Too proud to let him know.
Grey years that show in her hair.
Can't be, but don't seem to care.
She knocks the door and there's no one there.
nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody's going to help you now.
