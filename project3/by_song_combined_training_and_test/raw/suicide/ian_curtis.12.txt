#Something Must Break

Someone take these dreams away that point me to another day, a duel of personalities that stretch all true realities, that keep calling me.
they keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me.
Where figures from the past stand tall and mocking voices ring the halls, imperialistic house of prayer, conquistadors who took their share that keep calling me, they keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me.
They keep calling me.
Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me.
They keep calling me.
