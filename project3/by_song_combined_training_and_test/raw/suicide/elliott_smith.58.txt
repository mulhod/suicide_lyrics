#Looking over My Shoulder

wiped out in the city slick, another sick rock 'n roller acting like a dick, needing cash, burning through the trash that piles up in this place and fills up behind my empty face full of things that i'm not to do.
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i don't want to know and i'm looking over my shoulder, booking away with nowhere to go.
i run down to the corner lot.
it's forty-five past two.
i almost forgot to show.
got a date to make with mr. so-and-so, after which i won't care when you all start to bitch and moan about being alone.
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i don't want to know and i'm looking over my shoulder, booking away with nowhere to go.
well, can't you just leave me alone?
you've already thrown all the sticks and stones you had to send my way.
well, can't you just leave it at that and spare us both the bother because i just bounce back, anyway?
i got nothing that i want to do more than make another sonnet fuck-you to play whenever you make my life cliche so to fit in some little box with all the labelled shit you would say to keep confusion away.
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i don't want to know and i'm looking over my shoulder, booking away with nowhere to go.
you come over with all of your friends and all their opinions i don't want to know and i'm looking over my shoulder, booking away.
