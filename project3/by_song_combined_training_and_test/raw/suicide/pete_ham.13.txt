#Walk Out in the Rain

So I just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me.
And, if the rain should go away, then in my lonely room I'll stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away.
So I just live a life of hope, pretending that I couldn't care, but, if you find you cannot cope, just call my name and I'll be there.
If I could live my life again, I still relive those precious times.
Although I know there would be pain, it felt so good while you were mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
Be mine.
So I Just walk out in the rain, so I Just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain, so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me, thousand tears you gave.
And, if the rain should go away, and if the rain should go away, then in my lonely room I stay, then in my lonely room I stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go.
And, if you ever change your mind, you know, baby, you will find all my sorrow and my pain.
You'll find me walking in the rain.
