#A Distorted Reality Is Now a Neccessity to Be Free

i'm floating in a black balloon, o.d. on easter afternoon.
my mama told me, baby, stay clean.
there's no in-between.
and, all you ladies and you gentlemen, between is all you've ever seen or been.
fit poorly and arrange the sight.
doll it up in virgin white.
you disappoint me, you people raking in on the world.
the devil's script sells you the heart of a blackbird.
shine on me, baby, because it's raining in my heart.
sun is rising on a chopping glare.
rain dropping acid blotter in the air.
a distorted reality's now a necessity to be free.
so disappointing.
so, first i put it all down to luck.
god knows why my country don't give a fuck.
fuck.
shine on me, baby, because it's raining in my heart.
shine on me, baby, because it's raining in my heart.
