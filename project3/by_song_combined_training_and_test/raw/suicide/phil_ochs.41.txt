#I Ain't Marching Anymore

Oh, I marched to the battle of New Orleans at the end of the early British war 
The young land started growing.
The young blood started flowing.
but I be not marching anymore for I've killed my share of Indians in a thousand different fights.
I was there at the Little Big Horn.
I heard many men lying.
I saw many more dying.
But I be not marching anymore.
It's always the old to lead us to the war.
It's always the young to fall.
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun.
Tell me, is it worth it all? for I stole California from the Mexican land, fought in the bloody Civil War.
Yes, I even killed my brothers and so many others.
But I be not marching anymore for I marched to the battles of the German trench in a war that was bound to end all wars.
Oh, I must have killed a million men and now they want me back again.
But I be not marching anymore.
It's always the old to lead us to the war.
It's always the young to fall.
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun.
Tell me, is it worth it all? for I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky, set off the mighty mushroom roar.
When I saw the cities burning, I knew that I was learning that I be not marching anymore.
Now the labor leader's screaming when they close the missile plants.
United Fruit screams at the Cuban shore.
call it Peace or call it Treason, call it Love or call it Reason, but I be not marching anymore, no, I be not marching anymore.
