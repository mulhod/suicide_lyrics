#Son of Sam

something's happening.
don't speak too soon.
i told the boss off and made my move.
got nowhere to go.
son of sam, son of the shining path, the clouded mind, the couple killer each and every time.
i'm not uncomfortable, feeling weird, lonely, leered, options disappear, but i know what to do.
son of sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love, acting under orders from above.
king for a day, son of sam, son of the shining path, the clouded mind, the couple killer running out of time.
shiva opens her arms now to make sure i don't get too far.
i may talk in my sleep tonight because i don't know what i am.
i'm a little like you, more like son of sam.
