#And Her Daddy's a Millionaire

Priscilla Bagshot lives in a house with a hundred and twenty rooms, with butlers and bakers and candlestick vapors and horses and horsesgrooms.
People don't like her.
they say she's a fool, but I know I disagree.
I know her better.
she`ll lend me ten-bob and I know she's in love with me.
Oh, oh, she's a beautiful girl.
she doesn't have a care.
Oh, oh, she's a wonderful girl and her daddy's a millionaire.
I meet her on Sundays.
we go for a ride and it means the world to me.
She lets me take her out to the woods, then back to her house for tea.
People don't like her.
they say she's a fool, but I know I disagree.
I know her better.
she'll lend me ten-bob and I know she's in love with me.
Daddy's a millionaire.
Daddy's a millionaire.
Daddy's a millionaire.
