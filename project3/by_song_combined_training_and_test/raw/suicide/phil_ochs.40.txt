#No More Songs

Hello, hello, hello, is there anybody home?
I've only called to say, I'm sorry.
The drums are in the dawn and all the voices gone and it seems that there are no more songs.
Once I knew a girl.
she was a flower in a flame.
I loved her as the sea sings sadly.
Now the ashes of the dream can be found in the magazines and it seems that there are no more songs.
Once I knew a sage who sang upon the stage.
He told about the world, his lover, a ghost without a name, stands ragged in the rain and it seems that there are no more songs.
The rebels, they were here.
they came beside the door.
They told me that the moon was bleeding.
Then all to my surprise they took away my eyes and it seems that there are no more songs.
A star is in the sky.
it's time to say goodbye.
A whale is on the beach.
he's dying.
A white flag in my hand and a white bone in the sand and it seems that there are no more songs.
Hello, hello, hello, is there anybody home?
I've only called to say, I'm sorry.
The drums are in the dawn and all the voices gone and it seems that there are no more songs.
It seems that there are no more songs.
It seems that there are no more songs.
