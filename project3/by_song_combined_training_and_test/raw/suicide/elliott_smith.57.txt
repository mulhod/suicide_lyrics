#New Monkey

here comes the sidewalk-boss again, telling me how i can't cave in, that i'm a study in black, need a pat on the back.
i looked up and smiled, a picture of dissatisfaction that he can only see as a junkie.
though i might be straight as an arrow, he's busy shaking hands with my monkey, busy shaking hands with my monkey.
i go in my car straight to the bar where my sweetie pours the beer for the millions of fans ignoring the bands.
he's in my ear, wants me to live in denial, says you've got to settle for something.
though it might not be really living, anything is better than nothing, anything is better than nothing.
no happy action-man going to move in to take my place.
i'll be pumping out the product, just a total waste.
look at your hands unoccupied.
look at the lengths you'll go to hide.
you're under the veil, pretending to fail, got a whole lot of empty time left to go.
now you've got to fill it with something.
i know what you can do.
don't you know anything is better than nothing?
no happy action-man going to move in to take my place.
i'll be pumping out the product, just a total waste.
i'm here with my cup, afraid to look up.
this is how i spend my time, lazing around, head hanging down, stuck inside my imagination, busy making something from nothing, pictures of hope and depression.
anything is better than nothing.
anything is better than nothing.
anything is better than nothing.
anything is better than nothing.
