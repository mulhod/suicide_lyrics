#Last Call

last call, he was sick of it all, asleep at home.
told you off and goodbye.
well, you know one day it'll come to haunt you, that you didn't tell him quite the truth.
you're a crisis.
you're a icicle.
you're a tongueless talker.
you don't care what you say.
you're a jaywalker and you just just walk away and that's all you do.
the clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes made him wonder who he thought that he knew.
last call, he was sick of it all.
the endless stream of reminders made him so sick of you, sick of you, sick of you, sick of your sound, sick of you coming around trying to crawl under my skin when I already shed my best defense.
it comes out all around that you won and I think I'm all done.
you can switch me off safely while I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me.
yeah, yeah, you're still here, but just check to make sure.
all you aspired to do was endure.
you can't ask for more, ask for none, knowing you'll never get that which you ask for, so you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon.
you start to drink.
you just want to continue.
it'll all be yesteryear soon.
you start to drink.
you just want to continue.
it'll all be yesteryear soon.
church bells and now I'm awake and I guess it must be some kind of holiday.
I can't be seen to join in the celebration, but I'll go to the service and I'll go to pray and I'll sing the praises of my maker's name like I was as good as she made me and I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me, I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me,
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me, I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me, I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me, I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me, I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me, I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me.
I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me.
