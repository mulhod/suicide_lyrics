#Whatever (Folk Song in C)

they come here alone and they leave in twos, except for you and me who just came to you as if you're all done like you said you'd be.
what are you doing hanging out with me?
why you tell me stuff that's so plainly untrue?
if you'll be straight with me, i'll be straighter with you.
if you're all done like you said you'd be, what are you doing hanging out with me?
i haven't wanted to do anything for a long time, but whatever you got right now would probably suit me fine.
