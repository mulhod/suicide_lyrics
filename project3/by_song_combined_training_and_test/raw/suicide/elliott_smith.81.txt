#No Name #2

concrete hands picked up the telephone-ring.
do you know who you're talking to?
no, and i don't care who, she whispered quiet terror news.
he didn't give a hoot, said do what you have to do.
all she had to do was speak, mouthpiece to cheek.
please say no more.
i'm lying here on the ground, a strip of wet concrete.
her name was just a broken sound, a struffle step you hear when you're falling down.
killing time won't stop this crying.
killing time won't stop this crying.
killing time won't stop this crying.
you better start watching what message that you send now, no more situations i only go in to be kicked out.
he got knocked down leaning like he ran into a clothesline and remembered a couple of words that hid a crime.
you're just fine.
you'll be just fine, but i'm on the other line.
killing time won't stop this crying.
killing time won't stop this crying.
killing time won't stop this crying.
