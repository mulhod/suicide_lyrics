#Norwich Jail 

So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale, we wonder if we'll ever see the last of Norwich Jail.
The food is foul.
The air is bad.
The company not choice.
It would make you scowl to hear that mad old turnkey's rasping voice.
It would make you wonder would you ever live to tell the tale Of the hardships and the miseries you've known in Norwich Jail.
Our water here is scummy-green.
Our beds is heaps of straw.
There's water running down the walls, rats running over the floor.
There's naught to eat but rotten meat that'd make a dog turn pale.
Oh, it's dainty board and lodging when you visit Norwich Jail!
So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale, we wonder if we'll ever see the last of Norwich Jail.
Whene'er we fancy bathing, we paddles in the drains.
And when we wants a concert, we rattles of our chains.
And when we want a banquet we drink sludge and call it ale.
If you want a good time, commit a crime and come to Norwich Jail!
Now if you fancy gaming here, the race is run by fleas.
The stakes are perilously high: a crust of moldy cheese.
The first time that I tried my luck, I nearly lost my shirt.
But lucky for me they couldn't see the bugger for the dirt.
So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale, we wonder if we'll ever see the last of Norwich Jail.
If they'd sent us to America, today we would be free.
But since the Revolution that land we'll never see.
We are not for New England's shores, three thousand miles away.
They say we're bound for some further ground and they've named it Botany Bay.
Well perhaps it's out by India, or maybe near Japan.
Just off the coast of Canada or in the hills of Spain.
But wherever that strange land may be we know it cannot fail to be a far, far better place than stinking Norwich Jail.
So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale we long for the day when we'll sail away from stinking Norwich Jail.
