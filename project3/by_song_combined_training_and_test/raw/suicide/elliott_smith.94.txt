#Amity

amity, amity, amity, amity, amity, amity, amity caught stars in her arms.
hello, hello, kitty, happy in new york city.
amity walking like a lucky charm.
i'm a neon sign and i stay open all the time.
so let's go, go, go, go.
amity, amity, god don't make no junk, but it's plain to see he still made me.
he told me so.
i'm good to go.
i'm ready to go because you laugh and talk and because you make my world rock.
i'm so, so, so, so, amity, amity, amity, amity, amity, amity, amity, good to go.
