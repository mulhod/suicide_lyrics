#The Sound of Music

See my true reflection.
Cut off my own connections.
I can see life getting harder.
so sad is this sensation.
Reverse the situation.
I can't see it getting better.
I'll walk you through the heartbreak, show you all the outtakes.
I can't see it getting higher, systematically degraded, emotionally a scapegoat.
I can't see it getting better.
Perverse and unrealistic.
Try to make it all sick.
I can't see it getting better.
Hollow now, I'm burned out.
all I need to break out.
I can't see life getting higher.
Love of life makes you feel higher.
Love of life makes you feel higher, higher, higher, higher, higher,, higher, higher, higher, higher.
Love of life makes you feel higher.
