#Too Many Martyrs

In the state of Mississippi many years ago, a boy of 14 years got a taste of southern law.
He saw his friend hanging and his color was his crime and the blood upon his jacket left a brand upon his mind.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
His name was Medgar Evers and he walked his road alone like Emmett Till and thousands more whose names we'll never know.
They tried to burn his home and they beat him to the ground, but deep inside they both knew what it took to bring him down.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
The killer waited by his home hidden by the night as Evers stepped out from his car into the rifle sight.
he slowly squeezed the trigger.
the bullet left his side.
It struck the heart of every man when Evers fell and died.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
And they laid him in his grave while the bugle sounded clear, laid him in his grave when the victory was near, while we waited for the future for freedom through the land.
The country gained a killer and the country lost a man.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
