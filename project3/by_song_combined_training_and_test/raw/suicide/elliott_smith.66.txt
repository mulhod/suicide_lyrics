#Georgia Georgia

georgia, georgia, it's been many miles since i've seen your fallen smile close up and personal, your arsenal of excuses.
you never told her when you walked out on this vanished shoulder with your veins all full of beer, thinking, well, at least now everything is clear.
oh, man, what plan, suicide.
it's just not that much different from my own affair, always cussing and crying.
how about if you tell me something new, tell me what will make you happy?
oh, you so deserve to be.
there were protests and contests, actions to cop.
i want it all to stop.
three weeks ago you were all grace and charm and now i know it was just a false alarm.
georgia, georgia, i can't understand your sins.
you have no forgiveness, no attention left to pay.
the quiet way you leave and just forget it all just takes my breath away.
how's that supposed to make me feel?
yeah, well, how am I suppossed to feel?
