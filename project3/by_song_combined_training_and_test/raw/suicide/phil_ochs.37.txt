#Ten Cents a Coup

It was a used car dealer's election and the choice was rather small.
The boys agreed, "It's the war we need, so there's no president at all."
Here's to Nixon and Agnew.
They are the stars of the stage and screen.
Not since Laurel and Hardy have I laughed so hard I screamed.
I thought that Johnson was the devil.
I thought we couldn't do no worse.
Now the White House stands in Disneyland.
This country must be under a curse.
Here's to Nixon and Agnew.
They are the stars of the stage and screen.
Not since Laurel and Hardy have I laughed so hard I screamed.
I dreamed that Nixon died of a sun-tan.
There was only Spiro left.
at his swearing-in, he fell on his chin.
He assassinated himself.
Here's to Nixon and Agnew.
They are the stars of the stage and screen.
Not since Laurel and Hardy have I laughed so hard I screamed.
