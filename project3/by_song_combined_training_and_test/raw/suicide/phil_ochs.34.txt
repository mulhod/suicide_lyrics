#Boy in Ohio

Creek was running by the road and the Buckeye sun was shining.
I rode my bike down Alum Creek Drive when I was a boy in Ohio.
The English teacher, he didn't care.
He challenged us to checkers and once in a while we'd swap a joke.
When I was a boy in Ohio, once I was caught playing hooky from school.
They found me home in the evening.
I confessed I had been to the movie show when I was a boy in Ohio.
We would wait for the summer to come, for swimming and picking berries, but now a freeway covers the field where I used to be so happy.
I remember the Burger Boy, where the girls would shine like the engines and the radio was always loud when I was a boy in Ohio.
Spanish teacher, she tried to help.
She was much too pretty, so I just stared at the back of her legs when I was a boy in Ohio.
It was beer at the honkytonk bar where they said the girls were easy, but somehow I never found me one when I was a boy in Ohio.
Soon I was grown and I had to leave and I've been all over the country, but I don't believe I've had more fun than when I was a boy in Ohio.
