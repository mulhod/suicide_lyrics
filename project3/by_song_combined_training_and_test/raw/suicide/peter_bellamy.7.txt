#I Once Lived in Service 

I once lived in service to a lady so fine.
I've served her by night and by day.
I've carried the dishes when the lady would dine, and after, I cleared them away.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is all slavery.
I've made up her bed, and I turned down her sheets.
I ironed the dresses she wore.
I've peeled her potatoes.
I've roasted her meats.
And it was I, with my broom, swept her floor.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is all misery.
I scrubbed her front doorstep.
I polished her plate.
I put coals in the pan for her bed.
I've rose before sunlight to blacklead her grate, and at midnight I've laid down my head.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is all drudgery.
I've carried her water.
I've answered her door.
I've polished the shoes for her feet.
And when she went to church, then her prayer-book I bore behind as she marched down the street.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant's a penance to me.
Now, I met a young man in the village one day as I run to the shop for her bread.
He's asked me my name, but I had to away lest me mistress should break me poor head.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant has no liberty.
So that night as I lay in my attic so bare, I resolved that I would run away.
And all for to honor the waggoner's fare, some silver spoons took for me pay.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is melancholy.
Now I lie in prison but I will not weep.
Who knows what tomorrow may hold?
There's some fine lads in here for my company to keep.
There's strong arms to keep me from cold.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a convict is all chivalry!
Now I've known confinement the most of me years.
Small freedom did I ever know.
Some prisons, sure, they have no cold iron bars, but some prisons, why, they have no men!
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a convict's a pleasure to me.
Dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant was never so free!
