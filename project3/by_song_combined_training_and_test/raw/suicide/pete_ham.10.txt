#Rock of All Ages

Well, you're taking all my money and I guess you think it's funny, but I don't.
my, my.
You always want it right now and you know it brings me down, but I don't.
why, why?
Guess you think it's funny that you're taking all my money, but I don't.
You know you should believe me, baby.
every night you leave me on my own.
my, my.
We got to get together, baby, try to make it better, but you won't.
why, why?
Every night you're leaving, but you know you should believe me, but I don't.
My, my, my, my.
you know you take me down the line.
My, my, my, my.
baby, don't you know you're mine?
You're taking all my money and I guess you think it's funny, but I don't.
my, my.
You always want it right now and you know it brings me down, but I don't.
why, why?
Guess you think it's funny that you're taking all my money, but I don't.
My, my, my, my.
you know you take me down the line.
My, my, my, my.
baby, don't you know you're mine?
You're taking all my money and I guess you think it's funny, but I don't.
my, my.
You always want it right now and you know it brings me down, but I don't.
why, why?
Guess you think it's funny that you're taking all my money, but I don't.
You know you should believe me, baby.
every night you leave me on my own.
my, my.
We got to get together, baby, try to make it better, but you won't.

Every night you're leaving, but you know you should believe me, but I don't.
