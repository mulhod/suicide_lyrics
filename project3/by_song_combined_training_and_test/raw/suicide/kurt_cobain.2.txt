#Floyd the Barber

Bell on door clanks.
come on in.
Floyd observes my hairy chin.
Sit down in the chair.
don't be afraid.
Steamed hot towel on my face.
I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed.
Barney ties me to the chair.
I can't see.
I'm really scared.
Floyd breathes hard.
I hear a zip.
Pee-pee pressed against my lips.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
I sense others in the room.
Opie Aunt Bee, I presume.
They take turns and cut me up.
I die smothered in Andy's clutch.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
