#Scentless Apprentice

Like most babies smell like butter, his smell smelled like no other.
He was born scentless and senseless.
He was born a scentless apprentice.
Go away.
get away.
get away.
Every wet nurse refused to feed him.
Electrolytes smell like semen.
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets.
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers.
Go away.
get away.
get away.
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms.
Leaking-out gas fumes are made into perfume.
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit.
Go away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
