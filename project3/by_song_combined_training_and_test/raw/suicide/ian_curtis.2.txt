#Isolation

In fear every day, every evening, he calls her aloud from above, carefully watched for a reason, painstaking devotion and love, surrendered to self-preservation from others who care for themselves, a blindness that touches perfection,, but hurts just like anything else.
Isolation, isolation, isolation.
Mother, I tried.
please believe me.
I'm doing the best that I can.
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through.
I'm ashamed of the person I am.
Isolation, isolation, isolation.
But if you could just see the beauty, these things I could never describe, these pleasures a wayward distraction.
This is my one lucky prize.
Isolation, isolation, isolation.
