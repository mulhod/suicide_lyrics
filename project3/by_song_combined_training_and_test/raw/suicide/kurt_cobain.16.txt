#Heart-Shaped Box

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak.
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks.
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap.
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice.
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet.
Cut myself on angel's hair and baby's breath.
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black.
Throw down your umbilical noose, so I can climb right back.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.
