#Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands

everybody cares, everybody understands.
yes, everybody cares about you, yeah, and whether or not you want them to.
it's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head to a pure synthetic sympathy that infuriates you totally and a quiet lie that makes you want to scream and shout.
so here i lay dreaming, looking at the brilliant sun raining its guiding light upon everyone.
for a moment's rest you can lean against the banister after running upstairs again and again from wherever they came to fix you in, but always fear city's finest follow right behind.
you got a pretty vision in your head, a pencil full of poison lead, and a sickened smile illegal in every town.
so here i lay dreaming, looking at the brilliant sun raining its guiding light upon everyone.
here i lay dreaming, looking at the brilliant sun raining its guiding light upon everyone.
you say you mean well.
you don't know what you mean.
fucking ought to stay the hell away from things you know nothing about.
