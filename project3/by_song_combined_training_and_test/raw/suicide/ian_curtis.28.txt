#The Only Mistake

Made the fatal mistake, like I did once before, a tendency just to take till the purpose turned sour.
Strain.
take the strain.
these days we love.
Strain.
take the strain.
these days we love.
Yeah, the only mistake was that you ran away, avenues lined with trees, strangled words for the day.
Yeah, the only mistake, like I made once before.
Yeah, the only mistake.
could have made it before.
Strain.
take the strain.
these days we love.
Strain.
take the strain.
these days we love.
And the only mistake led to rumours unfound, led to pressures unknown, different feelings and sounds.
Yeah, the only mistake, like I made once before.
Yeah, the only mistake.
could have made it before.
