#Watford John

You show me all your loving.
Then you turn and tell me no!
Open up your arms and let it go.
You give me all your kissing.
Then you freeze and stop the flow.
Open up your knees and let it go.
I don't want a Cinderella.
I just want my teddy bear.
I don't want a backstage Bella.
I just want to take you there.
Baby, won't you think it over?
Try and see my point of view.
Let it go.
You show me all your loving.
Then you turn and tell me no!
Open up your arms and let it go, let it go, let it go.
I don't want a Cinderella.
I just want my teddy bear.
I don't want a backstage Bella.
I just want to take you there.
Baby, won't you think it over?
Try and see my point of view.
Come on, baby, won't you tell me no!
Bop bop-a-lop do-wop.
Let it go, let it go, let it go.
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.
Let it go, let it go.
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go.
