#A Means to an End

A legacy so far removed one day will be improved. 
Eternal rights we left behind.
We were the better kind. 
Two the same.
set free, too.
I always looked to you.
I always looked to you.
I always looked to you. 
We fought for good, stood side by side, our friendship never died. 
On stranger waves, the lows and highs, our vision touched the sky.
Immortalists with points to prove.
I put my trust in you. 
I put my trust in you. 
I put my trust in you. 
A house somewhere on foreign soil, where ageless lovers call.
Is this your goal, your final needs, where dogs and vultures eat?
Committed still, I turn to go. 
I put my trust in you. 
I put my trust in you. 
I put my trust in you. 
I put my trust in you, in you, in you, in you. 
Put my trust in you, in you.
