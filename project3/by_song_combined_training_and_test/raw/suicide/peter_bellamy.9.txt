#Sweet Loving Friendship

If you look out from some high, high window, You will see the sun set beyond the town.
You will see the rooks to the tree-tops screaming, and the wing of evening come folding down.
Between the morning and the evening, between the Springtime and the Winter drear, there comes a time of new beginnings, when sweet loving friendship drives away all fear.
There is many here they know naught but sorrow, and like the beasts they live from day to day.
But we can think on a bright tomorrow since sweet loving friendship drives all grief away.
All hope in prison, it soon will smother if none will with you your sorrow share.
But we cling fast to one each other and sweet loving friendship banishes despair.
Just like the sailor when his ship makes harbor, just like the traveller who finds an inn, what care they if the wind blows harder when they be safe and warm within?
No lonely convict can resist the darkness, just as no sailor can the driving rain.
But find a comrade for to share your fastness and sweet loving friendship will ease your pain.
So if you look out from some high, high window, and see the sun set beyond the sky.
You need not mourn at the coming shadow if some loving friend is standing nigh.
