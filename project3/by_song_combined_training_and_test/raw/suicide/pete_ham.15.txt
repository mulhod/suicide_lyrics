#Give It a Try

Give it a try and we can make it so high.
You'll never feel this way again.
Wipe off your sorrow and pain.
come into my heart.
Just give it the time.
should work out fine.
We can make it.
we can break it.
It's not a command.
just give me your hand.
We can break it.
whoa, oh, We can take it, take it.
Give it a try and then change your desire.
You'll never make love on your own now that the love seed is sown.
Don't put out the fire.
Give it the time.
we can work out fine.
We can make it.
we can break it.
It's not a command.

We can break it.
we can take it.
Give it a try and we can make it so high.
You'll never feel this way again.
Wipe off your sorrow and pain.

Give it a try and then change your desire.
You'll never make love on your own now that the love seed is sown.
Don't put out the fire, yea!
