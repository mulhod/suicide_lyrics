#Turnaround

Take a step outside yourself and you turn around.
Take a look at who you are.
It's pretty scary, so silly.
It's Revolting.
You're not much.
You can't do anything.
Take a step outside the city and you turn around.
Take a look at what you are.
It is revolting.
You're really nowhere, so wasteful, so foolish, poppycock!
Who said don't look back?
Don't believe them.
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant because they're going to try and get behind you.
Don't you let them do it.
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking?
It's pretty scary.
it's so revolting.
It's pretty scary.
it's so revolting.
It's pretty scary.
it's so revolting.
It's pretty scary.
it's so revolting.
Take a step outside the country and you turn around.
Take a look at what you are.
It is amazing.
Take a good look.
You're no big deal.
You're so petty.
It's a laugh.
Take a step outside the planet.
Turn around and around.
Take a look at where you are.
It's pretty scary.
