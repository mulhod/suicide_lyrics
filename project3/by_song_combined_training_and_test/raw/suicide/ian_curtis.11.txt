#Atmosphere

Walk in silence.
Don't walk away in silence.
See the danger, always danger.
Endless talking.
Life rebuilding.
Don't walk away.
Walk in silence.
Don't turn away in silence.
Your confusion, my illusion, worn like a mask of self-hate, confronts and then dies.
Don't walk away.
People like you find it easy, naked to see.
walking on air.
hunting by the rivers, through the streets.
Every corner abandoned too soon, set down with due care.
Don't walk away in silence.
Don't walk away.
