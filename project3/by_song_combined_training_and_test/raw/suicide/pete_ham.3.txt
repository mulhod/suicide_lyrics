#I Miss You

Though you've been gone for just a week, it makes me feel so sad to speak.
Lady, come back.
I miss you.
And, though before I didn't cry, now my eyes are never dry and a thousand jesters couldn't make me smile.
I miss you.
I miss you.
And now I know that I was wrong, but it's too late for now you've gone.
Lady, come back.
I miss you.
And, though our times were good and bad, now you're gone, I'm always sad and a thousand jesters couldn't make me smile.
I miss you.
I miss you.
I miss you.
