#When I Say 

What you are is what I see.
What I see is what I want it to be.
When I say I love you, what I mean is I really do.
I'm not the one who'll give you everything you need, but what I mean is that I'll try.
I can't deny that I've been burning inside for all the things I'll never see.
So come on, be yourself, nothing else.
Who could ask for any more?
And you know, they all love you.
What is more, I really do.
I'm not the one who'll give you everything you need, but what I mean is that I'll try.
I can't deny that I've been burning inside for all the things I'll never see.
