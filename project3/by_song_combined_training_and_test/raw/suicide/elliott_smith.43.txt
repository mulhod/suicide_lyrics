#Don't Go Down

i met a girl, snowball, in hell.
she was hard and as cracked as the liberty bell.
i got her to come on and move in with me and i said i'd find a better place.
we could spend eternity.
don't go down.
don't go down.
stay with me, baby, stay.
her mama called me a thief and her dad called himself commander in chief.
i fought him off with my love, but i knew the sense of worthlessness she would have to raise above.
don't go down.
don't go down.
stay with me, baby, stay.
don't go down.
don't go down.
stay with me, baby, stay.
she had a dream, woke up in shock.
she had seen her own body outlined in chalk.
i split the scene, the globe been spun, and her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun.
don't go down.
don't go down.
stay with me, baby, stay.
don't go down.
stay with me, baby, stay.
don't go down.
stay with me, baby, stay.
