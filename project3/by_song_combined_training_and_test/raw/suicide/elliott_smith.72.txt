#Fear City

dragged down into lowercase, trying to get your cops to talk right, but they can't put the paper in your face.
you're just trying to walk by, so now i got a new game, baby.
no one's going to recognize it, your broken english over their flat, tired remarks still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life.
isn't it pretty?
yeah.
i'm going to see my city dead.
i can do everything that your man does, except for better, got no interest now in undressing your kids.
with cheap angst love letters you write your name in all of the places no one goes.
some can't be satisfied until everybody knows.
isn't it pretty?
yeah.
i'm going to see my city dead.
isn't it pretty?
yeah.
i'm going to see my city dead.
come on.
isn't it pretty?
yeah.
i'm going to see my city dead.
