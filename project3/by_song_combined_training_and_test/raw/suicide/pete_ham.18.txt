#I Can't Take It

Just give me five so I can step outside
Or even give me three and I'll be satisfied
But if you give me none at all
You're going to see me climb that wall
And you know you're going to see me fall
And I can't take it

Take all the nights that a man can give and make all the days so a man can live, but, if you take up every hour, you're going to take up all my power and you know you're going to turn me sour and I can't take it, no.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
Give me all your money in your dark brown vase.
You've even got my soul in your dark brown case, but, baby, can't you see outside?
You know you've got my fingers tied and you know you're going to hurt my pride and I can't take it.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
Give me all your money in your dark brown vase.
You've even got my soul in your dark brown case, but, baby, can't you see outside when you know you've got my fingers tied and you know you're going to hurt my pride and I can't take it?
I can't take it, oh, no.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
I can't take it, oh, no.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it.
Place a lock upon my door.
