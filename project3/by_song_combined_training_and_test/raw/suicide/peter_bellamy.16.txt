#Roll Down

Sweet ladies of Plymouth, we're saying goodbye.
Roll down!
But we'll rock you and roll you again by and by.
Walk her round, my brave boys and roll down!
And we will roll down!
Walk her round, my brave boys and roll down!
Now the anchor's aweigh and the sails are unfurled, and we're bound for to take her half-way round the world.
In the wide Bay of Biscay the seas will run high, and the poor sickly transports they'll wish they could die.
When the wild coast of Africa it do appear, the poor nervous transports they'll tremble with fear.
When the Cape of Good Hope it is rounded at last, the poor lonesome transports they'll long for the past.
When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout, the poor simple transports they'll goggle and shout.
And when we arrive off Australia's strand, the poor weary transports they'll long for the land.
And when we set sail for old England's shore, the poor stranded transports we'll see them no more.
Then sweet ladies of Plymouth we'll pay all your rent, and go roving no more till our money's all spent.
