The Ballad of Henry & Susannah, Pt. 1

Come all you gentle people and listen to my tale, concerning a poor convict.
From Suffolk he did hail.
For fourteen years transported, as you shall understand for to lead a poor and wretched life upon Van Diemen's Land.
Young Henry Cabell was his name, and in Mendham he did dwell.
His poor but honest parents, they reared him right well till cruel hardship overcame them and his father in despair to feed his family did embark upon a wild career.
