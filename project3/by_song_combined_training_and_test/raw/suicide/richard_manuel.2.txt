#We Can Talk

We can talk about it now.
It's that same old riddle only starting from the middle.
I'd fix it, but I don't know how.
Well, we could try to reason, but you might think it's treason.
One voice for all, echoing along the hall.
Don't give up on father clock.
We can talk about it now.
Come, let me show you how to keep the wheels turning.
you've got to keep the engine churning. 
But did you ever milk a cow?  
I had the chance one day, but I was all dressed up for Sunday.
Everybody, everywhere, do you really care?  
Well, then, pick up your heads and walk.
We can talk about it now.
It seems to me we've been holding something underneath our tongues.
I'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back, it would likely burst your lungs  .
Stop me if I should sound kind of down in the mouth, but I'd rather be burned in Canada than to freeze here in the south.
Moving that eternal plough.
We've got to find a sharper blade or have a new one made.
Rest awhile and cool your brow.
Don't you see there's no need to slave, the whip is in the grave.
No, no trance.
It's safe now to take a backward glance because the flames have turned to chalk.
We can talk about it now.
