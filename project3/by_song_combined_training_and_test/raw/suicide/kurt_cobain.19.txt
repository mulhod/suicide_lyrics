#Dumb

I'm not like them, but I can pretend.
The sun is gone, but I have a light.
The day is done, but I'm having fun.
I think I'm dumb or maybe just happy, think I'm just happy, think I'm just happy, think I'm just happy.
My heart is broke, but I have some glue.
Help me inhale and mend it with you.
We'll float around and hang out on clouds.
Then we'll come down and have a hangover, have a hangover, have a hangover, have a hangover.
Skin the sun.
Fall asleep.
Wish away.
The soul is cheap.
Lesson learned.
Wish me luck.
Soothe the burn.
Wake me up.
I'm not like them, but I can pretend.
The sun is gone, but I have a light.
My day is done, but I'm having fun.
I think I'm dumb, maybe just happy, think I'm just happy, think I'm just happy, think I'm just happy.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
I think I'm dumb.
