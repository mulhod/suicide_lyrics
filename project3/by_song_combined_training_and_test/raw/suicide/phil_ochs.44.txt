#That's What I Want to Hear

Oh, you tell me that your last good dollar is gone and you say that your pockets are bare.
And you tell me that your clothes are tattered and torn and nobody seems to care.
Now, don't tell me your troubles.
No, I don't have the time to spare.
But, if you want to get together and fight, good buddy, that's what I want to hear.
And you tell me that your job was taken away by a big old greasy machine.
And you tell me that you don't collect no more pay and your belly is growing lean.
Now, if I had the jobs to give, you know I'd give them all away.
But don't waste your breath calling out my name if you don't have nothing to say.
And you tell me that you don't have nothing to do and you keep on wasting your time.
And you say when you want to get your family some food, you got to stand in a relief line.
Now, it's a sin and a bloody shame about the way they're pushing you around, but, when you decide not to take no more, you know I'll put my money down because I've seen your kind many times before and I'll see them many times again.
Oh, but every bad thing that's happened to you has happened to better men, so don't explain that you've lost your way, that you've got no place to go.
You've got a hand and a voice and you're not alone.
Brother, that's all you need to know.
And, if you're still wondering what I'm trying to say, let me tell you what it's all about.
Now, nobody listens to a single man when he's walking around down and out, so, if you're looking for an answer, he's standing there by your side and you'll never really know how far you'll go till you join together and try.
So, you tell me that your last good dollar is gone and you say that your pockets are bare.
And you tell me that your clothes are tattered and torn and nobody seems to care.
Now, don't tell me your troubles.
No, I don't have the time to spare.
But, if you want to get together and fight, good buddy, that's what I want to hear.
