#Beeswax

Why doesn't she need him for a father?
Not only maidens can occupy my shack.
Goring my manhood turns a man off.
Like Pepe LePew would say, Hey, hey, hey! and then we clash!
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly.
She laughs about it, shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right, jacking themselves off polyester.
I want to jump.
this isn't right! 
Hey, when am I getting it back?
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly.
I don't know why.
I've got a joke too silly to say.
Don't touch the balls.
I got a dick, Dick.
hear my fucking hate!
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly.
If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly.
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy.
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate.
Feeling can't help me romp.
Bill, just fuck me.
take me anal.
Billy's slit reminds me of someone.
I'm sick of paying for the love boat.
Tony and Tenille say, want to jump rope?
And I say look!
I got my penis spayed. 
I got a little tail.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got to be around pussy.
Don't let me fall.
I got a heh-heh.
well, you can't live.
We got my dingaling spayed.
We got my dingaling spayed.
We got my dingaling spayed.
We got my dingaling spayed.
We got my dingaling spayed.
We got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my diddly.
