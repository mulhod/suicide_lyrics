#Pretty Mary K (Other Version)

pretty mary k walks along the docks with some sailor's pay shoved down in her sock.
pretty mary k with some little boy in blue who can't stay away from you.
pretty mary k, take him back to town.
i'm down here by the bay where the water pounds up against the wall, crying black and blue.
it keeps me away from you.
pretty words that you whisper.
maybe i misunderstood.
somebody's not paying attention to what they promised and their word isn't good.
oh, mary k, i can see her face down there in the waves, painted and erased, but i know it's just the reflection of the moon, a big fake resembling you.
going to go down in the water, fill my mouth up full of sand.
i'll be waiting, still impatient, with my dead imagination while you're with some other man.
pretty mary k is off in somebody's room.
i'm down here by the bay with my arm around the moon, but i'll be with you soon.
just as soon as i pay, i walk across the water with pretty mary k, walk on the water, pretty mary k.
