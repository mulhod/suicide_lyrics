#Whispering Pines

If you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream, here inside my lonely room there is no in between.
If you find me in a gloom or catch me in a dream, inside my lonely room there is no in between.
Whispering pines, rising of the tide.
If only one star shines, that's just enough to get inside.
I will wait until it all goes around.
With you in sight the lost are found.
Foghorn through the night, calling out to sea.
Protect my only light for she once belonged to me.
Let the waves rush in, let the seagulls cry for, if I live again, these hopes will never die.
I can feel you standing there, but I don't see you anywhere.
Standing by the well, standing by the well, wishing for the rains, wishing for the rains, reaching to the clouds, reaching to the clouds for nothing else remains.
Drifting in a daze when evening will be done, try looking through a haze at an empty house in the cold, cold sun.
I will wait until it all goes around.
With you in sight the lost are found.
