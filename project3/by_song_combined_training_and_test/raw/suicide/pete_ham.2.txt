#Timeless

We are yesterday.
we are today.
We are tomorrow.
we are timeless.
We are then.
we are now.
We are the future.
we are timeless.
We are the sorrow.
we are the pain.
We are the sunshine.
we are rain.
We are love.
we are hate.
We are the future.
we are timeless.
Whatever we see, wherever we go shows perfectly clear how little we know.
How can we look and not even see?
How can we live and not even be free?
We are the comfort.
we are the shame.
We are forgiveness.
we are blame.
We are kind.
we are kill.
Are we the future?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we timeless?
are we?
Are we timeless?
are we?
