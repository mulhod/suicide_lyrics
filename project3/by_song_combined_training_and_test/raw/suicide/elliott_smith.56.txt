#High Times

Coma kid taught me how he'd come to follow you around wherever you go, said I don't go where I'm supposed to go, and I don't go really anywhere, you know?
Told me how he's driven by a curse till he kicked out into reverse, said I don't go where I'm supposed to go, and I don't go really anywhere, you know?
I made up my mind and I don't mind saying so.
I went to meet you at central square and, when I couldn't find you there, I went walking around the city some more, people-watching with a cold, blank stare, and I saw your face in everyone, I swear.
Seems I never get your kick quite right.
I was walking slow to a dirty dive.
I'm so sick and tired trying to change your mind when it's so easy to disconnect mine.
High times, high times, high times.
Yeah, I feel fine.
High times, high times, high times.
Man, I feel fine.
Don't pick me up .
I'm fine right where I am.
I don't go where I'm supposed to go, where I'm supposed to go.
