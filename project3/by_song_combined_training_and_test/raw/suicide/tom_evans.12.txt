#King of the Load 

He's the king of the road, the old man, the child.
The joker running wild, making it funny.
He's of no fixed abode .
When he carries the load, he'll do anything he can to make it funny.
But he'll never say die if he's living a lie.
Pick up his hat and go. 
If there's reason to cry, he'll just make it a sigh, and wander on down the road.
He's a natural friend with the money to lend, or whatever it takes to turn you on, too. 
He's the father, the son. 
He don't owe anyone. 
All his debts are all paid with his confection.
Then he'll wander away with no time in his way.
Pick up his hat and go. 
He'll never say die if he's living a lie. 
Just wander on down the road, wander on down the road. 
And he'll wander away with no time in his way.
Pick up his hat and go. 
He never said die. 
He was living a lie. 
Just wandered on down the road, wandered on down the road, wandered on down the road.
