#2:45 AM

i'm going out sleepwalking where mute memories start talking.
the boss that couldn't help but hurt you and the pretty thing he made desert you.
i'm going out now like a baby, a naive unsatisfiable baby, grabbing onto whatever's around for the soaring high or the crushing down with hidden cracks that don't show but that constantly just grow.
i'm looking for the man that attacked me while everybody was laughing at me.
you beat it in me, that part of you, but i'm going to split us back in two.
tired of living in a cloud.
if you're going to say shit now, you'll do it out loud,
it's 2:45 in the morning and i'm putting myself on warning for waking up in an unknown place with a recollection you've half erased, looking for somebody's arms to wave away past harms.
i'm walking out on center circle.
the both of you can just fade to black.
i'm walking out on center circle, been pushed away and i'll never go back.
