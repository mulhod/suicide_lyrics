#Love Will Tear Us Apart

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low and resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow and we're changing our ways, taking different roads, love, love will tear us apart again. 
Love, love will tear us apart again. 
Why is the bedroom so cold? 
Turned away on your side. 
Is my timing that flawed? 
Our respect run so dry? 
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives. 
Love, love will tear us apart again. 
Love, love will tear us apart again. 
Do you cry out in your sleep? 
All my failings exposed.
Gets a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold. 
Why is it something so good just can't function no more? 
Love, love will tear us apart again. 
Love, love will tear us apart again. 
Love, love will tear us apart again. 
Love, love will tear up apart again.
