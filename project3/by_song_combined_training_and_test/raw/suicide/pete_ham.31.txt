#Just a Chance

Doesn't matter what you think I do.
All I want to do is see it through.
You may say it's not a great romance, but all I want from you is just a chance to try, any way at all.
Don't you think we know it has to hurt?
Are minds that small?
I won't tell you if it's short or long.
All I know is that it don't feel wrong.
You may say it's not a great romance, but all we want from you is just a chance to try any way we can.
Don't you think we know it has to hurt?
Won't you understand?
Doesn't matter what you think I do.

You may say it's not a great romance, but all I want from you is just a chance to try any way we can.
Don't you think we know it has to hurt?
Won't you understand?
