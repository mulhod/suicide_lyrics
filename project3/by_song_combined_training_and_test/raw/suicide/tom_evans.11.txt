#Where Do We Go From Here

Someone gives you their heart, but you still throw it all away, knowing the past is a part, part of what you are today.
We all know you had your troubles.
We all know you had your days.
What is love?
You can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride, telling yourself you're a loser like someone winning who's not, telling yourself you're a loser.
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Someone showed you the way that you'll be ready to see that the game had been played.
Losers had lost, and the winners were free.
We all know you have your troubles.
We all know you have your ways.
What is love?
You can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride, telling yourself you're a loser like someone winning who's not, telling yourself you're a loser.
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
We all know you have your troubles.
We all know you have your days.
What is love?
You can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride, telling yourself you're a loser like someone winning who's not, telling yourself you're a loser.
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
