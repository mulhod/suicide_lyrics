#The White Lady Loves You More

keep your things in a place meant to hide, but i know they're there somewhere and i know that's where you'll go tonight.
i'll be thrown over just like before.
the white lady loves you more.
need a medal, man, just to pick up your feet.
it's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreet.
i know what this medal is for.
the white lady loves you more.
i'm looking at a hand full of broken plans and i'm tired of playing it down.
you just want her to do anything to you.
there be not nothing that you won't allow.
you wake up in the middle of the night from a dream you won't remember, flashing on like a cop's light.
you say she's waiting and i know what for.
the white lady loves you more, the white lady.
