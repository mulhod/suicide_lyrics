#Faithless

I know a girl who warns of the dangers of love, all the pain and the anguish, the sorrow that it brings.
She keeps herself in a world that's protected.
Her outsides are tough, but inside her heart longs to sing.
Don't let your walls down, you might fall in love, you might fall in love.
He's going to get his girlfriend's name tattooed on his neck and hope he never, never lives to regret.
He's going to walk down that long, dark alley and what he finds there you know he'll never forget.
Don't let your walls down, you might fall in love, you might fall in love.
They're crashing down now.
You might fall in love.
I remember a time I believed that the words love and pain were both one in the same.
I'm going to trade in my old ways for a new shot at life.
I'm going to change, change my direction.
I'm going to change my ways.
Don't let your walls down, you might fall in love, you might fall in love.
They're crashing down now.
It's you I'm thinking of, it's you I'm thinking of.
Let's fall in love.
