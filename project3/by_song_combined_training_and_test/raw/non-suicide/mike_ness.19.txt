#Let it be Me

I've been in love, but now I'm waiting.
Don't ever want to worry about a thing.
I sit at home and I wonder: will I rise or will I go under.
Let it be me, let it be me, if you're lonely.
Let it be me, let it be me, your one and only.
Let it be me, let it be me, to satify you.
Let it be me, if your feeling blue.
I've seen you aroud, but you don't know me.
I've watched your life, but can't always see.
I'll try and I'll try girl to love you.
And when we die,  you will have loved too.
Let it be me, let it be me, if you're lonely.
Let it be me, let it be me, your one and only.
Let it be me, let it be me, to satify you.
Let it be me, if your feeling blue.
You know your friends talk bad about me.
Your folks say it's not suppose to be.
You know girl your life is going by fast, try to make it last.
Let it be me, let it be me, if you're lonely.
Let it be me, let it be me, your one and only.
Let it be me, let it be me, to satify you.
Let it be me, if your feeling blue.
