#New Morning

Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Rabbit running down across the road, underneath the bridge where the water flowed through.
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue on this new morning, new morning, on this new morning with you.
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style, coming down the road for a country mile or two.
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue on this new morning, new morning, on this new morning with you.
The night passed away so quickly.
It always does when you're with me.
Can't you feel that sun shining?
Groundhog running by the country stream.
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true.
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue on this new morning, new morning, on this new morning with you.
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue on this new morning, new morning, on this new morning with you.
New morning, new morning, new morning, new morning, new morning, new morning, new morning, new morning.
