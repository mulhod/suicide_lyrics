Let them all pass all their dirty remarks.

There is one question I'd really love to ask. 
One Heart!
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner, who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?
One Love! 
What about the one heart?

One more thing!
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armagiddyon. 
One Love!
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom. 
One Song!
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner.
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation.
Saying one Love! 
What about the One Heart? 
One Heart!
