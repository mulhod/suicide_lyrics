#Burn

This world rejects me.
This world threw me away.
This world never gave me a chance.
This world going to have to pay.
Well I don't believe in your institutions.
I did what you wanted me to.
And like the cancer in your system.
I've got a little surprise for you.
Something inside of me has opened up its eyes.
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realise?
This thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound.
Sometimes I think I could.
Burn.
Burn.
I look down there where you're standing.
Flock of sheep all on display.
With all your lies piled up around you.
I can take it all away.
Something inside of me has opened up its eyes.
Why did you put it there?
Did you not realise?
This thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound.
Sometimes I think I could.
I'm going to burn this whole world down.
I'm going to burn this whole world down.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I never was a part of you
Burn.
I am your savior.
I am corruption.
I am the angel of your destruction.
I am perversion, secret desire.
I am your future swallowed up in fire.
