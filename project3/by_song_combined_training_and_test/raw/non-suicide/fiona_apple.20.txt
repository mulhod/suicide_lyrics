#The Child Is Gone

Darling, give me your absence tonight.
Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white.
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside, and don't bother leaving the light on because I suddenly feel like a different person.
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion, and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion, a vacancy that just did not belong.
The child is gone.
Honey help me out of this mess.
I'm a stranger to myself but don't reach for me.
I'm too far away.
I don't want to talk because there's nothing left to say.
So my darling, give me your absence tonight.
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside because there's no kind Of loving that can make this all right.
I'm trying to find a place I belong, and I suddenly feel like a different person.
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coersion, and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion.
As the darkness turns into the dawn, the child is gone, the child is gone.
