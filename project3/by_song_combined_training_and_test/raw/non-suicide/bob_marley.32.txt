#Waiting in vain

One, two, three.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl, my heart says follow through.
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line, but the waiting feel is fine.
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string, because I know I have to do my thing.
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb.
I wanna know when you're gonna come, soon.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
because if summer is here, I'm still waiting there.
Winter is here, and I'm still waiting there.
Like I said: it's been three years since I'm knocking on your door, and I still can knock some more.
Ooh, girl, ooh, girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more.
you see, in life I know there's lots of grief, but your love is my relief.
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn, while I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn.
See!
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love.
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh!
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
No I, no I, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
No, no, no, I, no, I, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
It's your love that I'm waiting on.
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
It's me love that you're running from.
It's Jah love that I'm waiting on.
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain.
It's me love that you're running from.
