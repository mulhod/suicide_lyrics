#I Don't Know	   

Whatever it is you're thinking, sit down and let's give it a try.
You know that I'll always listen, but sometimes I'm wondering why.
You don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
Baby I'm feeling lost.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
Once in a while you're lonely.
Tell me you needed a friend.
I'm wondering what is the matter, but you say that you can't explain.
But you don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
But, baby, I'm feeling lost.
I don't know what I'm going through.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
Do you want me?
I want you.
You don't want me?
I want you.
Don't you know I'm losing sleep at night, sleep at night.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
Whatever it is you're thinking, sit down and let's give it a try.
You know that I'll always listen, but sometimes I'm wondering why.
You don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
But, baby, I'm feeling lost.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
I got to get away from you.
