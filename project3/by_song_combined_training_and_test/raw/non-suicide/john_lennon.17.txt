#You Are Here

From Liverpool to Tokyo, what a way to go.
From distant lands, one woman, one man.
Let the four winds blow.
Three thousand miles over the ocean, three thousand light-years from the land of the rising sun.
Love has opened up my eyes.
Love has blown right through.
Wherever you are, you are here.
Wherever you are, you are here.
Three thousand miles over the ocean, three thousand light-years from the land of the surprising sun.
Well, now, east is east and west is west.
The twain shall meet.
East is west and west is east.
Let it be complete.
Three thousand miles over the ocean, three thousand light-years from the land of the morning star.
