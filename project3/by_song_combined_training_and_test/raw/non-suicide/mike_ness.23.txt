#It Could 've Been Me

I got friends who are in prison, friends who are dead.
I'm going to tell ya something that I've often said.
You know these things that happen, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't ya know it could 've been me.
I had me a good girl, her kisses sweeter than wine.
And I had always hoped that someday I'd make her mine.
But she ran off and married, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't ya know it could 've been me.
Well the junkie cops on First Street, sticks a needle in his arm.
No, he never meant to do anyone no harm.
But he's buried six feet deep, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't ya know it could 've been me.
I had me a good girl, her kisses sweeter than wine.
And I had always hoped that someday I'd make her mine.
Bus she ran off and married, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't you know it could 've been me.
Could 've been me, could 've been me, could been me, could 've been me, could 've been me,
could 've been me, could 've been me, could 've been me.
Could 've been, should 've been me.
