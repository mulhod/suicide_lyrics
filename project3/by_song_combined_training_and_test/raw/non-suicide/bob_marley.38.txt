#She's gone

My woman is gone, woman is gone.
My woman is gone, woman is gone.
She had left me a note hanging on my door.
She say she couldn't take it, she couldn't take any more.
The pressure around me, just couldn't see.
She felt like a prisoner who needs to be free.
Fools have tried, yeah, wisemen have failed.
Oh, listen to me, honey.
Life could never be another jail.
Still we know now.
we'll never see smoke without fire, and everyone you see has a heart desire.
She's gone, she's gone.
She's gone, she's gone.
She's gone, she's gone. 
She's gone, ye-ah!
Oh, mockingbird, have you ever heard words that I never heard?
Oh, mockingbird, have you ever heard words that I never heard?
She made it through the exit.
She just couldn't take it.
She made it through the exit.
She just couldn't make it.
And, oh, my children, if you see me crying my woman is gone.
If you see me, if you see me, if you see me, if you see me crying, if you see me, if you see me, if you see me, if you see me crying she's gone, she's gone.
She's gone, she's gone. 
She's gone, ye-ah!
Oh, mockingbird, have you ever heard words that I never heard?
Oh, mockingbird, have you ever heard words that I never heard?
She's gone, she's gone.
She's gone, she's gone. 
She's gone, she's gone.
