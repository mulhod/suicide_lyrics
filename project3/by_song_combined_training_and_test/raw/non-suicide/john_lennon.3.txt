#Mother

Mother, you had me, but I never had you.
I wanted you , but you didn't want me.
So I've got to tell you goodbye, goodbye.
Father, you left me, but I never left you.
I needed you, but you didn't need me.
So I just got to tell you goodbye, goodbye.
Children, don't do what I have done.
I couldn't walk, and I tried to run.
So I got to tell you goodbye, goodbye.
Mama, don't go.
Daddy, come home.
Mama, don't go.
Daddy, come home.
Mama, don't go.
Daddy, come home.
Mama, don't go.
Daddy, come home.
