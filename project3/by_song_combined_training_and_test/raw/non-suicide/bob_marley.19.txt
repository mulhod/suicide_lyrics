#Small axe

Why boasteth thyself, oh, evil men?
Playing smart and not being clever, oh, no!
I say you're working iniquity to achieve vanity, yeah, if a-so a-so.
But the goodness of Jah, Jah, endureth for ever.
If you are the big tree, we are the small axe sharpened to cut you down, ready to cut you down, oh, yeah!
These are the words of my master. 
Keep on telling me, oh, oh, no weak heart shall prosper.
Oh, no, they can't, eh!
And whosoever diggeth a pit, Lord, shall fall in it, shall fall in it.
Whosoever diggeth a pit shall bury in it, shall bury in it.
If you are the big tree, we are the small axe sharpened to cut you down, ready to cut you down.
Whosoever diggeth the pit shall fall in it, fall in it, eh!
Whosoever diggeth the pit shall bury in it, shall bury in it.
If you are the big tree, we have a small axe ready to cut you down, sharpened to cut you down.
If you are the big tree, let me tell you this: We are the small axe ready to cut you down, sharpened to cut you down.
If you have a big tree, we are the small axe.
