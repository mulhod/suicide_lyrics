#Closer

You let me violate you.
You let me desecrate you.
You let me penetrate you.
You let me complicate you.
Help me I broke apart my insides. 
Help me I’ve got no soul to sell.
Help me the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
I want to feel you from the inside.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
my whole existence is flawed.
You get me closer to god.
You can have my isolation. 
You can have the hate that it brings.
You can have my absence of faith.
You can have my everything.
Help me tear down my reason. 
Help me it's your sex I can smell.
Help me you make me perfect. 
Help me become somebody else.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
I want to feel you from the inside.
I want to fuck you like an animal.
My whole existence is flawed.
You get me closer to god.
Through every forest, above the trees, within my stomach, scraped off my knees. 
I drink the honey inside your hive. 
You are the reason I stay alive.
