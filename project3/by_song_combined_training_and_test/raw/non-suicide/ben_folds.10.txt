#Time

Think of me any way you want.
I can be the problem if that's easier.
In your head, move the pieces around, things I've said.
Turn the memory upside down and it makes it better, I know, but sometimes it's hard to swallow.
In time, I will fade away.
In time, I won't hear what you're saying.
In time, but time takes time, you know.
Tell your friends the things they want to hear and see.
Start the drums.
Band against the enemy and in time I will fade away.
In time, I won't care what you're saying.
In time, but time takes time, you know.
In your head, move the pieces around, things I've said.
Turn the memory upside down.
It might make it better, I know, but sometimes it's hard to swallow.
In time, I will fade away.
In time, I won't care what you're saying.
In time, but time takes time, you know.
Time takes time you know.
