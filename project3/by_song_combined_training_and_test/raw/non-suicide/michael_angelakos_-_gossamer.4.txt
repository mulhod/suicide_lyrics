#Constant Conversations

Well, you're wrapped up in a blanket and you're staring at the floor.
The conversation's moderated by the noisy streets below.
I never want to hurt you, baby.
I'm just a mess with a name and a price and now I'm drunker than before.
They told me drinking doesn't make me nice.
You never know where some people will go.
Yeah, some people been hurting me.
You can tell by a look, by the slightest crook in the neck or the blink of an eye.
Well, then, they'll see what they see, and they'll do what they'll do, but that doesn't mean a goddamn thing.
You can listen if you want.
You can listen if you don't.
Yeah, they'll talk.
Yeah, they'll even sing.
Everybody now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, they come singing through the window, singing through the trees.
Yeah, they're singing trough the bright spring leaves.
Everybody now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, they love you when they need you, but someday you're going to need to find some other kind of place to go, oh.
Now you're standing in the kitchen, and you're pouring out my drink.
Well, there's a very obvious difference, and it's that one of us can think.
If there's a bump in the road, yeah, you fix it, but for me I'll just run off the road.
But tonight you've got me cornered, and I haven't got a place to go.
You never know where some people will go.
Yeah, some people been hurting me.
You can tell by a look, by the slightest crook in the neck or the blink of an eye.
Well, then, they'll see what they see, and they'll do what they'll do, but that doesn't mean a goddamn thing.
You can listen if you want.
You can listen if you don't.
Yeah, they'll talk.
Yeah, they'll even sing.
Everybody now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, they come singing through the window, singing through the trees.
Yeah, they're singing through the bright spring leaves.
Everybody now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sing it loud, sing it loud.
Yeah, they love you when they need you, but someday you're going to need to find some other kind of place to go, don't you know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh?
