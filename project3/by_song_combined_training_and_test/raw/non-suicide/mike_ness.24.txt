#She's a Knockout

Everywhere she goes, people turn their heads, she's a knockout.
Everyone wishes she was sleeping in their beds, she's a knockout.
When guys see her coming they start spending their money, she's a knockout.
But don't you know I'm the only one who can call her honey, she's a knockout.
She's a knockout, She's a knockout, she's a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, she's a knockout.
She's exotic but not foreign, built like an old Cadillac, she's a knockout.
Once she's left your life she be not never coming back, she's a knockout.
With her black silk stockings and her high-heeled shoes, she's a knockout.
Once she's left your life, you'll surely sing the blues, she's a knockout.
he's a knockout, She's a knockout, she's a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, she's a knockout.
Some friends were telling me, just the other day,
They walk right up to her, they don't know what to say.
And when she calls me, hear a ring on the telephone,
I'll be there waiting for her, sitting at home all alone, all alone.
In the nightclubs baby when the lights shine down, she's a knockout.
If the feeling be not right she don't even come around, she's a knockout.
When she walks down the aisle ya know her hips begin to sway, she's a knockout.
come on little baby I'll show you the way, she's a knockout.
She's a knockout, She's a knockout, she's a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, she's a knockout.
