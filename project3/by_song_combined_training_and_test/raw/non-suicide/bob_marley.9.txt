#Concrete Jungle

No sun will shine in my day today.
No sun will shine.
The high yellow moon won't come out to play.
That high yellow moon won't come out to play.
I said darkness has covered my light.
And the stage my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found? 
Won't someone tell me because my sweet life must be somewhere to be found instead of concrete jungle where the living is harder, concrete jungle!
Man, you got to do your best, oh, yeah.
No chains around my feet, but I'm not free, oh ooh!
I know I am bound here in captivity.
G'yeah, I've never known happiness.
I've never known what sweet caress is.
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown.
Won't someone help me because I I've got to pick myself from off the ground.
Must be somewhere for me, eh, yeah, in this a concrete jungle!
I said, what do you cry for me now, oh!
Concrete jungle, ah, won't you let me be, now, hey, oh, now!
I said that life, sweet life, it must be somewhere to be found, must be somewhere for me.
Oh, instead, concrete jungle, confusion, confusion, confusion, eh!
Concrete jungle, baby, you've got it in.
Concrete jungle, now, eh, concrete jungle, what do you got for me now?
