#It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry

Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Well, I've been up all night, leaning on the windowsill.
Well, if I die on top of the hill and if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Now, the wintertime is coming.
the windows are filled with frost.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Well, I want to be your lover, baby.
I don't want to be your boss.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
