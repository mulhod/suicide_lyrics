#March of The Pigs

Step right up, march, push, crawl right up on your knees, please, greed, feed (no time to hesitate).
I want a little bit. 
I want a piece of it. 
I think he's losing it.
I want to watch it come down.
Don't like the look of it. 
Don't like the taste of it.
Don't like the smell of it.
I want to watch it come down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you all that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
Shove it up inside, surprise! 
Lies.
Stains like the blood on your teeth.
Bite, chew, suck, away the tender parts.
I want to break it up.
I want to smash it up.
I want to fuck it up.
I want to watch it come down.
Maybe afraid of it.
Let's discredit it. 
Let's pick away at it.
I want to watch it come down.
All the pigs are all lined up.
I give you al that you want.
Take the skin and peel it back.
Now doesn't that make you feel better?
The pigs have won tonight.
Now they can all sleep soundly.
And everything is all right.
