#Harvest Moon

Come a little bit closer, hear what I have to say.
Just like children sleepinh, we could dream this night away.
But there's a full moon rising.
Let's go dancing in the light.
We know where the music's playing.
Let's go out and feel the night because I'm still in love with you.
I want to see you dance again because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon.
When we were strangers, I watched you from afar.
When we were lovers, I loved you with all my heart.
But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high.
I want to celebrate, see it shining in your eye, because I'm still in love with you.
I want to see you dance again, because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon.
