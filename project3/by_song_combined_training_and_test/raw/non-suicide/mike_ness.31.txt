#99 to Life

I'm broken hearted, I'm a broken man. 
Driven by anger, on that night I ran. 
I had me a woman.
I thought that she'd be true.
Now she's gone and left me, you know her life is through.
Lonely weekends, baby lonely nights. 
The judge he gave me, ninety nine to life.
I wish she could be here, Lord if She only could. 
Instead she's laying in a puddle of blood.
She was my baby, thought she'd be my wife. 
I killed my baby, I killed her with my knife.
Lonely weekends, baby lonely nights. 
The judge he gave me, ninety nine to life.
So alone I'm sitting in my prison cell Lord only knows now, I'm in a living hell.
The rest of my life, in this penitentiary, the good Lord above now, please have mercy on me.
Lonely weekends, baby lonely nights. 
The judge he gave me, ninety nine to life.
