#Gimmie The Sweet and Lowdown

It was a moonlight mishap, you lost your party hat.
Seems your lifestyle be not so worthwhile after all.
A heavy-hearted taxi ride then a walk on the wild side.
Did your guardian angel let you down?
Gonna lay low and play it straight.
It's time to rejuvenate.
Gonna kick start your heart until you come around.
I can tell you now: you've really gotten the blues.
I can tell you now that I've walked in your shoes.
Gimme the sweet and lowdown.
You better get outta the way.
It's history made the hard way.
From a hero to a zero once again.
Aing. no time for vanity or this insanity.
You're maladjusted, and now you're busted once again.
I can tell you now it comes as no surprise.
I can tell you now by that look in your eyes.
Gimme the sweet and lowdown.
You're looking kinda punch drunk because that's the way you strut your stuff, with a swing and a swagger down the road you go.
You should've made a better choice and listened to your inner voice.
You got to get right or get left, don't ya know.
I can tell you now: it's the peak of bad news.
I can tell you now that I've walked in your shoes.
Gimme the sweet and lowdown, the sweet and lowdown, gimme the sweet - the sweet and lowdown.
