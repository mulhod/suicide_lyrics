#I was Wrong

Oh, when I was young I was so full of fear.
I hid behind anger, held back the tears.
It was me against the world.
I was sure that I'd win, but the world fought back, punished me for my sins.
I felt so alone, so insecure.
I blamed you instead, made sure I was heard, and they tried to warn me of my evil ways but I wouldn't hear what they had to say.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
I realize now that I was wrong.
And I think about my loves, well, I've had a few.
Well, I'm sorry that I hurt them.
Did I hurt you too?
I took what I wanted, put my heart on the shelf, but how can you love me when you don't love yourself?
It was me against the world.
I was sure that I'd win.
The world fought back, punished me for my sins and they tried to warn me of my evil ways, but I couldn't hear what they had to say.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
I realize now that I was wrong.
I was wrong, yeah, I was wrong.
I grew up fast, and I grew up hard.
Something was wrong from the very start.
I was fighting everybody, I was fighting everything, But the only one that I hurt was me.
I got society's blood running down my face.
Somebody help me get outta this place.
How could someone's bad luck last so long?
Until I realized that I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
I realize now that I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
The only moment that I was me, I was wrong.
