#Temporary Like Achilles

Standing on your window, honey, yes, I've been here before.
feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
How come you don't send me no regards?
You know I want your loving.
honey, why are you so hard?
Kneeling beneath your ceiling, yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your loving.
honey, why are you so hard?
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk, but is your heart made out of stone or is it lime or is it just solid rock?
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your loving.
honey, but you're so hard.
Achilles is in your alleyway.
he don't want me here, he does brag.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your loving.
honey, but you're so hard.
