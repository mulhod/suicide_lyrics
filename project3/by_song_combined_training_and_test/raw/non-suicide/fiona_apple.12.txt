#Waltz (Better Than Fine)

If you don't have a song to sing, you're okay.
You know how to get along humming, hmmm.
If you don't have a date, celebrate.
Go out and sit on the lawn and do nothing.
'Cause it's just what you must do.
Nobody does it anymore.
No I don't believe in the wasting of time, but I don't believe that I'm wasting mine.
If you don't have a point to make, don't sweat it.
You'll make a sharp one being so kind.
And I'd sure appreciate it.
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed.
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm better than fine?
