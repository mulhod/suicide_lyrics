#Unknown Legend

She used to work in a diner.
Never saw a woman look finer.
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor.
She grew up in a small town, never put her roots down.
Daddy always kept moving, so she did too.
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a Harley-Davidson, her long blonde hair flying in the wind.
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes, the air she breathes.
You know it ain't easy.
You got to hold on.
She was an unknown legend in her time.
Now she's dressing two kids, looking for a magic kiss.
She gets the far-away look in her eyes.
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a Harley-Davidson, her long blonde hair flying in the wind.
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes, the air she breathes.
