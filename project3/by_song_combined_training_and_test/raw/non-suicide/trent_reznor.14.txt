#That's What I Get

Just when everything was making sense, you took away all my self-confidence.
Now all that I've been hearing must be true.
I guess I'm not the only boy for you.
But that's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
How could you turn us into this, after you just taught me how to kiss you.
I told you I'd never say goodbye.
Now I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.
But's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
Why does it come as a surprise to think that I was so naive.
Maybe didn't mean so much.
but it meant everything to me.
But's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
That's what I get.
