#I'll Be Alright

Can you remember ever having any fun? because, when it's all said and done, I always believed we were, but now I'm not so sure oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I drink a gin and take a couple of my pills and my parade will give you chills.
Oh, honey, don't give me up, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know we've had enough.
You should go if you want to.
Yeah, go if you want to.
I'll be alright, be alright.
Well, I've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless.
Your whole life's been nothing but this.
I won't let you go unless I'll be alright.
I'll be alright.
I'm so self-loathing that it's hard for me to see reality from what I dream. 
No, no one believes me - no, not a single thing.
My brain is racing and I feel like I'll explode.
You're looking at me from below. 
This world wasn't made for you.
Just go find someone new.
You should go if you want to.
Yeah, go if you want to.
I'll be alright, be alright.
Well, I've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless.
Your whole life's been nothing but this.
I won't let you go unless I'll be alright.
I'll be alright.
Why do I keep holding onto suffering?
Heads gone on now, walls, my thoughts are stumbling
This party is over now.
It isn't happening
The wind in the sails could tell I'm only recovering.
You should go if you want to.
Yeah, go if you want to.
I'll be alright, be alright.
Well, I've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless.
Your whole life's been nothing but this.
I won't let you go unless I'll be alright.
I'll be alright.
