#Please Please Please

Please, please, please, no more melodies.
They lack impact; they're petty.
They've been made up already.
Please, please, please, no more maladies.
I'm so tired of crying; you'd think I was a siren.
But me and everybody's on the sad same team and you can hear our sad brain screaming: Give us something familiar, something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady, steady, steady going nowhere.
Please, please, please, no apologies.
At best they buy you time till you next step out of line.
Please, please, please, no more remedies.
My method is uncertain; it's a mess but it's working.
And maybe if you tried it out, you won't like it when you're crying out: Give us something familiar something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady, steady, steady, steady going nowhere.

You won't like it when you're crying out: Give me something familiar, something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady, steady, steady, steady going nowhere.
