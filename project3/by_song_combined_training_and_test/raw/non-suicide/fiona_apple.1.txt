Extraordinary Machine

I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes, and I certainly haven't been spreading myself around.
I still only travel by foot, and by foot it's a slow climb, but I'm good at being uncomfortable, so I can't stop changing all the time.
I notice that my opponent is always on the go, and won't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice he'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as they go fast from whence he came, but he's no good at being uncomfortable, so he can't stop staying exactly the same.
If there was a better way to go then it would find me.
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me.
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine.
I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day.
You deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay.
I mean to prove, I mean to move in my own way, and say I've been getting along for long before you came into the play.
I am the baby of the family, it happens, so everybody cares and wears the sheeps' clothes while they chaperone.  
Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease courteous, to try and help, but let me set your mind at ease.
If there was a better way to go then it would find me.
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me.
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine.
Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?
It's very kind, but it's to no avail; I don't want the bail.
I promise you, everything will be just fine.
If there was a better way to go then it would find me.
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me.
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine.
