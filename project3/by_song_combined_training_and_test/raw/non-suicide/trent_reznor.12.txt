#Kinda I Want To

I can't shake this feeling from my head.
There's a devil sleeping in my bed.
He's watching you from across the way.
I cannot make this feeling go away.
I know it's not the right thing, and I know it's not the good thing but kinda I want to.
I'm not sure of what I should do when everything I'm think of is you.
All of my excuses turn to lies.
Maybe God will cover up his eyes
I know it's not the right thing, and I know it's not the good thing but kinda I
want to.
And I want to, maybe just for tonight.
We can pretend it's alright.
What's the price I pay?
I don't care what they say.
I want to.
I want to.
