#On the Bound

All my life is on me now.
Hail the pages turning.
And the future is on the bound.
Hell don't know my fury.
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need you're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need youre all I need - and maybe some faith would do me good.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Don't know, should I Change my mind?
I can't decide.
There's too many variations to consider.
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do.
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself.
I make it bitter.
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time.
Tell me you belong to me.
Baby say that it's all going to be alright.
I believe that it isn't. 
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need you're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need youre all I need - and maybe some faith would do me good, and maybe some faith would do me good, and maybe some faith would do me good.
