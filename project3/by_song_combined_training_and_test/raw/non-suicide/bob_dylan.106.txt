#A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains.
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways.
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests.
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans.
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard.
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard rain's going to fall.
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it.
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it.
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping.
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding.
I saw a white ladder all covered with water.
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken.
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children.
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard it's a hard rain's going to fall.
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning.
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world.
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing.
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening.
I heard one person starve.
I heard many people laughing.
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter.
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley.
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard rain's going to fall.
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony.
I met a white man who walked a black dog.
I met a young woman whose body was burning.
I met a young girl.
she gave me a rainbow.
I met one man who was wounded in love.
I met another man who was wounded in hatred.
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard rain's going to fall.
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm going back out before the rain starts falling.
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest, where the people are many and their hands are all empty, where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters, where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison and the executioner's face is always well hidden, where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten, where black is the color, where none is the number.
and I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it and reflect from the mountain, so all souls can see it.
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking, but I'll know my song well before I start singing.
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard rain's going to fall.
