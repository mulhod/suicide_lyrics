#Highway 101

Take a drive baby up the coast, yea highway 101.
I'll pass Ventura and Santa Barbara too, just as fast as my motor runs.
Gotta pocket full of memories, some happy and some are sad.
Gotta girl standing by my side through the good times and the bad.
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain.
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains.
Sick boy, sick girl, looking nice dressed up on a Saturday night.
Take a walk downtown for a while and chase the pale moonlight.
I can still hear the mission bells and the train rolling through your town.
Gonna leave this world behind, we're Southern California bound.
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain.
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains.
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain.
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains.
Follow the palm trees under the California sun.
I believe in love now, I believe in love again.
