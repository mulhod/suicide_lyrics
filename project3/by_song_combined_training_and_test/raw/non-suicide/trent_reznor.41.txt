#Meet Your Master

Bow down in position against the polished steel.
This is something different.
You'll like this way this feels.
No time for asking questions.
No time for wondering.
We've heard enough from you now.
We've heard everything.
We're going to play a new game.
You'll put on this blindfold.
You'll do what we tell you.
You'll do as your told.
Used to be the leader.
Now comes the time to serve.
Maybe we show some mercy.
Maybe you get what you deserve.
Count down to the end, got to make it come faster, faster.
Right around the bend is a coming disaster.
Count down to the end, and we're headed there faster.
Come on down, my friend.
It's time to meet your master.
You've left quite a mess here under your stewardship.
You thought you'd figured it out, but you'll learn your place in this.
Might take some convincing for you to see the truth.
There are so many things that we've got in store for you.
Count down to the end, got to make it come faster, faster.
Right around the bend, is a coming disaster.
Count down to the end, and we're headed there faster, faster.
Come on down, my friend.
It's time to meet your master.
