#Speed of Sound	  

I remember the first time you said you loved me. 
I waited all weekend. 
You never called me. 
So you find him attractive. 
So what if he is? 
You'd like some excitement. 
You could count his same kiss. 
So it goes on and on. 
My love grows and yours is gone. 
A lonely existence, well it's just a lie. 
If there is a reason, I'd like to know why. 
Something I want you to know: I've told you this once before, don't want you to see him no more. 
Once again you've let me down, broke my heart, and turned me around. 
There's a light in the darkness. 
It doesn't seem far. 
Is something the matter that's brought us ajar? 
The plane goes down, will not land. 
Pilot's dead. 
Nowhere to be found.
