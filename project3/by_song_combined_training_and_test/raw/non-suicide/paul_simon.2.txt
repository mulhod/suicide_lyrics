#Leaves That Are Green

I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song.
I'm twenty-two now but I won't be for long.
Time hurries on.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown.
And they wither with the wind.
And they crumble in your hand.
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl.
I held her close, but she faded in the night like a poem I meant to write.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown.
And they wither with the wind.
And they crumble in your hand.
I threw a pebble in a brook.
And watched the ripples run away.
And they never made a sound.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown.
And they wither with the wind.
And they crumble in your hand.
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello.
Good-bye, Good-bye, Good-bye, Good-bye.
That's all there is.
And the leaves that are green turned to brown.
And they wither with the wind.
And they crumble in your hand.
