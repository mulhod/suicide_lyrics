#I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine

I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine alive as you or me, tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery with a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold, searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
"Arise, Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
but, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine alive with fiery breath and I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
