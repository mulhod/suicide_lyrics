#Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)

You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
You say you told me that you want to hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
I just can't do what I done before.
I just can't beg you anymore.
I'm going to let you pass and I'll go last.
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind when you go your way and I go mine.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
It can't be this way everywhere.
And I'm going to let you pass.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind when you go your way and I go mine.
Well, the judge, he holds a grudge.
he's going to call on you.
but he's badly-built and he walks on stilts.
watch out he don't fall on you.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
You say you got some other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You say my kisses are not like his, but this time I'm not going to tell you why that is.
I'm just going to let you pass.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind when you go your way and I go mine.
