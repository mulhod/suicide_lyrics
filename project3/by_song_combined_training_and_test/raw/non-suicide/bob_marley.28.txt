#Guiltiness

Guiltiness, talking about guiltiness, pressed on their conscience, oh, yeah.
And they live their lives, they live their lives, on false pretence every day, each and every day, yeah.
These are the big fish who always try to eat down the small fish, just the small fish.
I tell you what: They would do anything to materialize their every wish, oh, yeah.
Say woe to the downpressors.
They'll eat the bread of sorrow!
Woe to the downpressors.
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!
Woe to the downpressors.
They'll eat the bread of sorrow, oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
Guiltiness pressed on their conscience, oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
These are the big fish who always try to eat down the small fish, just the small fish.
I tell you what: They would do anything to materialize their every wish, oh, yeah.
But woe to the downpressors.
They'll eat the bread of sorrow!
Woe to the downpressors.
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!
Woe to the downpressors.
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow, oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
Guiltiness, oh, yeah, ah!
They'll eat the bread of sorrow every day.
