#Bend down low

Bend down low.
Let me tell you what I know now.
Bend down low.
Let me tell you what I know.
Oh, fisherman row to reap what you sow now.
Oh, tell you all I know, ooh, oh!
You've got to let me go now, ooh, oh!
And all you've got to do: Bend down low, oh, yeah! 
Let me tell you what I know.
Bend down low.
Let me tell you what I know, oh, yeah!
You keep on knocking, but you can't come in.
I get to understand you been living in sin.
But if you love me, woman, walk right in.
I've got a notch for your safety-pin, but bend down low.
Keep on knocking, but you can't come in.
I get to understand you been living in sin.
But walk right in, woman.
Sit right down.
I will keep on loving you.
I play the clown.
But bend down low, baby.
Let me tell you what I know.
Bend down low.
Let me tell you what I know, yeah!
Let me tell you, baby! 
Let me tell you.
Knock on, babe! 
Just won't let you in!
You been living in sin. 
Knock on!
