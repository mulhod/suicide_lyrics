#Give Judy My Notice

Judy, could anyone be loved anymore than I love you?
Does it hurt you too?
But Judy, I've been feeling small too long.
I love you so, but something's wrong.
And I come running when you want me here.
And when you want me to, I disappear.
Give Judy my notice.
I knew if I made it easy for you, you'd settle for me, yeah eventually.
But Judy, I won't be your bitch anymore and follow you around and hold the door.
And I can't do this any longer.
The vacuum left is so much stronger.
Give Judy my notice.
Give Judy my notice.
Judy you know I'm not mad anymore, at least most of the time, but that could take a while.
I've been living just to see you smile every once in a while.
Tears fall, but that don't mean nothing at all.
It's just because I said it first.
Yeah, that's why it hurts.
And I'm not sorry if you're not sorry.
And you're not sorry until I make you.
Give Judy my notice.
