#Subterranean Homesick Blues

Johnny's in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
I'm on the pavement, thinking about the government.
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off, says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off.
Look out, kid, it's something you did.
God knows when, but you're doing it again.
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend.
The man in the coon-skin cap in the pigpen wants eleven dollar bills.
You only got ten.
Maggie comes fleet-foot, face full of black soot, talking that the heat put plants in the bed, but the phone's tapped, anyway.
Maggie says that many say they must bust in early May, orders from the D.A.
Look out, kid, don't matter what you did.
Don't walk on your tip-toes, don't try No Doz, better stay away from those that carry around a fire-hose, keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes.
You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
Ah, get sick, get well, hang around the ink-well, ring bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell, try hard, get barred, get back, write Braille, get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail.
Look out, kid, you're going to get hit by losers, cheaters, six-time users hanging around the theaters.
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool.
Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters.
Oh, get born, keep warm, short pants, romance, learn to dance, get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success, please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Look out, kid, they keep it all hid.
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle, don't wear sandals, and try to avoid the scandals.
Don't want to be a bum?
you better chew gum,
The pump don't work because the vandals took the handles.
