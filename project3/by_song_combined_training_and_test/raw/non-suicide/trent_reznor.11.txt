#Something I Can Never Have

I still recall the taste of my tears.
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just to thing, and I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go away.
You make it all go away.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have.
You always were the one to show me how.
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now.
This thing is slowly take me apart.
Grey would be the color if I had a heart.
Come on, tell me.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just to thing, and I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go away.
You make it all go away.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have.
In this place it seems like such a same.
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same.
Everywhere I look you're all I see.
Just a fading, fucking reminder of who I used to be.
You make this all go away.
You make this all go away.
I'm down to just to thing, and I'm starting to scare myself.
You make this all go away.
You make it all go away.
I just want something.
I just want something I can never have.
I just want something I can never have.
