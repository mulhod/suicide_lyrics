#Revolution

Revelation reveals the truth, revelation.
revolution, revolution, revolution.
It takes a revolution to make a solution.
Too much confusion, so much frustration, eh!
I don't wanna live in the park.
Can't trust no shadows after dark, yeah-eh!
So, my friend, I wish that you could see, like a bird in the tree, the prisoners must be free, yeah! 
Never make a politician grant you a favour.
They will always want to control you forever, eh!
So if a fire make it burn, make it burn, make it burn, and if a blood make you run, make you run, run, run, rasta de 'pon top. 
Can't you see?
So you can't predict the flop, eh, eh!
We got lightning, thunder, brimstone, and fire, fire, fire, fire.
Lightning, thunder, brimstone and fire, fire, fire, fire!
Kill, cramp, and paralyze all weak at conception.
Wipe them out of creation, yeah!
Oh! Let i'es is i'es, in i'es is black,
In i'es is red, in i'es is dread.
Let righteousness cover the earth.
Like the water cover the sea, yeah, yeah!
Lightning, thunder, brimstone, fire, fire.
A lightning, thunder, brimstone, and fire.
