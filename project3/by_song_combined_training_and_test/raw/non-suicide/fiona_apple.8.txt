#Oh Well

What you did to me made me see myself something different.
Though I try to talk sense to myself, but I just won't listen.
Won't you go away, Turn yourself in.
You're no good at confession.
Before the image that you burned me in tries to teach you a lesson.
What you did to me made me see myself something awful.
A voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled.
It took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it.
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems I've been outbidded.
My peace and quiet was stolen from me.
When I was looking with calm affection, you were searching out my imperfections.
What wasted unconditional love on somebody who doesn't believe in the stuff.
You came upon me like a hypnic jerk when I was just about settled.
And when it counts you recoil with a cryptic word and leave a love belittled.
Oh what a cold and common old way to go.
I was feeding on the need for you to know me; devastated at the rate you fell below me.
What wasted unconditional love on somebody who doesn't believe in the stuff.
Oh, well.
