#Last

Gave up trying to figure out when my head got lost along the way.
Worn out from giving it up, and my soul I pissed it all away.
Still stings these shattered nerves, pigs we get what pigs deserve.
I'm going all the way down I'm leaving today.
Come, come, come on you've got to fill me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Come, come, come on, you're got to fix me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Still feel it all slipping away, but it doesn't matter anymore.
Everybody's still chipping away, but it doesn't matter anymore.
Look through these blackened eyes; you'll see ten thousand lies.
Come, come, come on you've got to fill me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Come, come, come on, you're got to fix me up.
Come, come, got to let me get through to you.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
I know it's all getting away, and it comes to me as no surprise.
I know what's coming to me, and is never going to arrive.
Fresh blood through tired skin, new sweat to drown me in.
Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive.
Come, come, come on you've got to fill me up.
Come, come, got to let me inside of you.
Come, come, come on, you're got to fix me up.
Come, come, got to let me get through to you.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
This isn't meant to last.
This is for right now.
I wish I could put the blame on you.
I want you to make me, I want you to take me, I want you to break me, then I want you to throw me away.
I want you to make me, I want you to take me, I want you to break me, then I want you to throw me away.
