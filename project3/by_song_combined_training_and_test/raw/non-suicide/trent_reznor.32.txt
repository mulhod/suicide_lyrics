#Beginning Of The End

Down on your knees you'll be left behind.
This is the beginning.
Watch what you think they can read your mind.
This is the beginning.
I got my mark; see it in my eyes.
This is the beginning.
My reflection I don't recognize.
This is the beginning.
We think we climb so high all up the backs we've condemned.
We face our consequence.
This is the beginning of the end.
You wait your turn, you'll be last in line.
This is the beginning.
Get out the way cause I'm getting mine.
This is the beginning.
God helps the ones that help themselves.
This is the beginning.
May be too late as far as I can tell.
This is the beginning.
We think we've come so far.
On all our lies we depend.
We face our consequence.
This is the beginning of the end.
