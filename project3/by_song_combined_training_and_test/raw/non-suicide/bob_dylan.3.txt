#Spanish Harlem Incident

Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me to the reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune down along my restless palms.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing, and your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch black, come and make my pale face fit into place, oh, please.
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning - if it's you my lifelines trace.
I been wondering all about me ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I know I'm around you, but I don't know where.
You have slayed me.
you have made me.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe, will you surround me, so I can know if I'm really real?
