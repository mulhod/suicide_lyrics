#When She Begins

I was feeling kinda beat, I decided to hit the streets. 
I was looking for a place for this heart of mine. 
Well I said to myself, oh God this must be hell.
I think I was slowly losing my mind.
Well round and round she goes where she'll stop nobody knows.
Y'know that woman put a spell on me. 
But if you start me, start me, start me, you can't stop me, stop me, stop me. 
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll.
I was hanging by the phone, tired of sleeping alone.
Baby tell me where did I go wrong? 
When minutes seem like hours and days seem like weeks, how could a year last so fucking long?
Well round and round she goes where she'll stop nobody knows.
Y'know that woman put a spell on me. 
But if you start me, start me, start me, you can't stop me, stop me, stop me. 
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll.
I was hanging with a couple of chicks, man I was just looking for kicks.
I was looking for a place for this raggedy ol' heart of mine.
Well I said to myself, oh God this must be hell.
I think I was slowly losing my mind.
Well round and round she goes where she'll stop nobody knows.
Y'know that woman put a spell on me. 
But if you start me, start me, start me, you can't stop me, stop me, stop me. 
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll.
