#Love Is Greed

You want a love, a love for us.
You want a selfless love that we can always say we trust.
Love has always been a mockery of those in love and scared to be in your need.
Don't want to love.
don't want to hurt.
If all that loneliness requires just another's comfort, better off being all on your own. 
There's a beauty in being alone.
Today we're arguing, it's not worth making another person that's just yours for the taking.
All your hoping and praying won't do more than saying that love is just greed.
It's almost taken me, but now I can see love is just greed, a selfish little need.
You follow or you lead.
If we really love ourselves, how do you love somebody else?
A love to us, a love to them.
It's just the history repeating itself time and time again.
Love is not a veil to hide your voice. 
All this talk of love just turns to noise.
So you want love, a love so tough that even all these truths don't seem as though they're adding up.
Haven't you already had enough? 
What's this suffering remind you of?
Someday we'll all agree it's not worth making another person that's just yours for the taking
All your hoping and praying won't do more than saying that love is just greed.
It's almost taken me, but now I can see love is just greed, a selfish little need.
You follow or you lead.
If we really love ourselves, how do you love somebody else?
A love all gone is just another story.
What's gone sour once was glory.
It's romance you want
well, ask for it, then.
Honey, could you put your arms around me so?
Tell me things about you that I wouldn't know and tell me that you love me like you do and maybe I will too.
Love is just greed.
It's almost taken me, but now I can see love is just greed, a selfish little need.
You follow or you lead.
If we really love ourselves, how do you love somebody else?
