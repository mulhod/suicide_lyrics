#Prison Food

You walked the earth, talked and never spoke a word.
She wonders who will be the first to go.
I said you know, the biggest things we got to face alone.
Don't want to waste time and go.
alone alone again.
alone alone again.
A trace of me, it floats in my periphery and, every time I turn to see, it goes.
Alone alone again lone alone again.
Alone alone again.
Floating by like a satellite to pass the time, you'll float by again and I can tell you about the little. things so you don't think about the big things for a while.
You walked the earth, talked and never spoke a word.
She wonders who will be the first to go.
Alone alone again.
Alone alone again.
Alone alone again.
Alone alone again alone.
