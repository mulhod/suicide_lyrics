#Gracie

You can't fool me, I saw you when you came out.
You got your mama's taste but you got my mouth.
And you will always have a part of me nobody else is ever going to see, Gracie girl, with your cards to your chest walking on your toes.
What you got in the box only Gracie knows.
And I would never try to make you be anything you didn't really want to be, Gracie girl.
Life flies by in seconds.
You're not a baby, Gracie, you're my friend.
You'll be a lady soon but until then you got to do what I say.
You nodded off in my arms watching TV.
I won't move you an inch even though my arm's asleep.
One day you're going to want to go.
I hope we taught you everything you need to know, Gracie girl.
And there will always be a part of me nobody else is ever going to see but you and me, my little girl, my Gracie girl.
