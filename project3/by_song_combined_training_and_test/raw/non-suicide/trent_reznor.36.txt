#Me, I'm Not

Well it's happening.
Never planned on this.
You've got something I need, kind of dangerous.
And I'm losing control.
I'm not used to this.
What you want from me.
I'm not used to this.
I can't shut it off this thing I've begun.
And it's hard to tell just where it's coming from.
And it's hard to see what I'm capable of.
And it's hard to believe just what I've become.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not
I can swallow it down, keep it all inside.
I define myself by how well I hide.
I feel it coming apart.
Well, at least I tried.
I can win this war by knowing not to fight.
If I take it all back, someway, somehow.
If I knew back then what I know right now.
Hey can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
Hey, can we stop...
Me, I'm not.
