#With God on Our Side

Oh, my name, it be not nothing.
my age, it means less.
The country I come from is called the Midwest.
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide and that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Oh, the history books tell it.
they tell it so well.
The cavalries charged.
the Indians fell.
The cavalries charged.
the Indians died.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
The Spanish-American War had its day and the Civil War, too, was soon laid away and the names of the heroes I's made to memorize with guns in their hands and God on their side.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
The reason for fighting I never did get, but I learned to accept it, accept it with pride for you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
The Second World War came to an end.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried, the Germans now, too, have God on their side.
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life.
If another war comes it's them we must fight, to hate them and fear them, to run and to hide, and accept it all bravely with God on my side.
But now we got weapons of chemical dust.
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must.
One push of the button and a shot the world wide and you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this, that Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss, but I can't think for you.
you'll have to decide whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
So now, as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell.
The confusion I'm feeling be not no tongue can tell.
The words fill my head and fall to the floor, that, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
