#O' Sailor

I'm undecided about you again.
Mightn't be right that you're not here.
It's double-sided, cause I ruined it all, but also saved myself, by never believing you, Dear.
Everything good, I deem too good to be true.
Everything else is just a bore.
Everything I have to look forward to has a pretty painful and very imposing before.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
I have too been playing with fifty-two cards. 
Just cause I play so far from my vest.
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard.
What could I do, but spend my best?
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees.
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me.
And in its wake, appeared the touch and call of a different breed, one who set to get me wise, and got me there, and then got me.
And what a thing, to know what could be instead.
Oh, what a blessed curse to see.
It took the agenda from its place in my bed, made a merry paramour of me.
O' Sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Saying there's nothing to it, and then letting it go by the boards.
O' sailor, why'd you do it?
What'd you do that for?
Giving me eyes to view it, as it goes by the boards.
