#Never Say Goodbye

Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break on footprints in the snow and silence down below.
You're beautiful beyond words.
You're beautiful to me.
You could make me cry.
never say goodbye because my dreams are made of iron and steel with a big bouquet of the roses hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
The crashing waves roll over me as I stand upon the sand and wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue, you'll change your last name too.
You've turned your hair to brown.
love to see it hanging down.
