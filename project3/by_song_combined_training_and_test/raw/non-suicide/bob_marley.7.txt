#Riding High

You've been riding.
You've been riding quite a while, child.
Keep on riding.
Keep on riding.
You've been jiving like a peacock.
That's your style.
keep on jiving.
ooh, keep on jiving.
Now I remember the days in school.
There wasn't a time when you didn't treat me cruel.
Ooh, wait till I get my hooks on you.
I'll show you what a fisherman can do.
You're riding.
Been riding quite a while, child.
Keep on riding.
Keep on riding.
You've been jiving like a peacock.
That's your style.
Keep on jiving.
Ooh-wee, keep on jiving.
You always try to hurt me in the end, in the presence of all our good, good friends, but the patient man always win.
Now I'll just wait till you give in.
You've been riding.
You've been riding quite a while.
Keep on riding.
Keep on, ride.
keep on riding.
You've been jiving like a peacock.
That's your style.
Keep on jiving.
Ooh-wee, alright. 
Keep on jiving.
At Christmas, more like an Easter bunny.
Just like a rabbit, you're always on the run, but wait till I get my trap on you.
I'll see where you gonna run to.
Wait till I get my trap on you, then I'll see where you gonna run to.
You've been riding.
You've been riding quite a while.
keep on riding.
Keep on, ride.
Keep on riding.
You've been jiving like a peacock.
That's your style.
Keep on jiving.
Ooh-wee, keep on jiving.
Riding on my own.
I need your love tonight.
Riding on my own.
When you hold me right.
