#Jealous Guy

I was dreaming of the past, and my heart was beating fast.
I began to lose control. 
I began to lose control.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh, no, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.
I was feeling insecure. 
You might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside.
I was shivering inside.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh, my, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh, my, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.
I was trying to catch your eye.
I thought that you were trying to hide.
I was swallowing my pain.
I was swallowing my pain.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh, my, I didn't want to hurt you.
I'm just a jealous guy.
watch out, baby, I'm just a jealous guy.
Look out, baby, I'm just a jealous guy.
