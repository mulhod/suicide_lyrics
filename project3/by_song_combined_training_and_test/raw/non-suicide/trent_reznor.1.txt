Wish

This is the first day of my last days.
I built it up, now I take it apart. 
Climbed up real high now fall down real far.
No need for me to stay. 
The last thing left, I just threw it away.
I put my faith in God and my trust in you, now there's nothing more fucked up I could do.
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true.
Wish there was something real in this world full of you.
I'm the one without a soul. 
I'm the one with this big fucking hole.
No new tale to tell. 
Twenty-six years on my way to hell.
Gotta listen to your big time, hard line, bad luck, fist fuck.
Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me I hate everyone.
Wish there was something real, wish there was something true.
Wish there was something real in this world full of you.
I want to but I can't turn back, but I want to.
