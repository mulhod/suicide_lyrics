#Red Red Red

I don't understand about complementary colors and what they say.
Side by side they both get bright.
Together they both get gray.
But he's been pretty much yellow, and I've been kinda blue, but all I can see is red, red, red, red, red now.
What am I going to do?
I don't understand about diamonds and why men buy them.
What's so impressive about a diamond except the mining?
And it's dangerous work trying to get to you too.
And I think if I didn't have to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it maybe I wouldn't think so much of you.
I've been watching all the time, and I still can't find the tack.
And I want to know: Is it okay?
Is it just fine?
Or is it my fault?
Is it my lack?
I don't understand about the weather outside, or the harmony in a tune, or why somebody lied.
There's solace a bit for submitting to the fitfully cryptically true.
What's happened has happened.
What's coming is already on its way with a role for me to play.
I don't understand.
I'll never understand, but I'll try to understand.
There's nothing else I can do.
