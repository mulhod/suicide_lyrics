#So Far Away

I've sung the blues, for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you.
I've paid my dues, working hard-sweat, blood, and tears for you.
So far away, So far away, So far away!
So far away, So far away, So far away! 
I've had it all, and lost it all in one blackout summer night.
I want it back, but I just can't seem to get it right.
So far away, So far away, So far away!
So far away, So far away, So far away! 
I've sung the blues, for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you.
I've paid my dues, working hard-sweat, blood and tears for you.
So far away, So far away, So far away! 
So far away, So far away, So far away!
