#Footprints on my Ceiling

Everybody wants a lover, nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past.
Long ago, without a care, pull Gardenias from her hair.
I think of a time we didn't have a care in the world.
Captivated by her beauty, I knew it was my life long duty.
She had all the grace and charm of a radiant queen.
How do you talk without speaking?
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling?
How do you take without giving?
And keep it all inside?
There are footprints on my ceiling.
I can't help this fucked up feeling.
Something's wrong, you be not coming round here no more.
Try to get my thoughts together, I think of a time when things were better this miscommunication is breaking me down.
How do you talk without speaking? 
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling?
How do you take without giving?
How you treat your new best friend?
Everybody wants a lover.
Nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past.
My heart is heavy, slowly sinking.
I redirect my desperate thinking, and kiss her red full lips like I did the very first time.
How do you talk without speaking? 
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling?
How do you take without giving?
There are footprints on my ceiling.
And I kept it bottled up inside all my life.
