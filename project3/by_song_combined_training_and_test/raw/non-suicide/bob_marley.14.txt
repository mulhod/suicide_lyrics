#No more trouble

We don't need no, we don't need no more trouble, no more trouble!
We don't need no more trouble, whoa, oh, oh, oh!
We don't need, we don't need no, no more trouble!
We don't need no trouble!
We don't need no more trouble.
Make love and not war because we don't need no trouble.
What we need is love, love to guide and protect us on, on.
If you hope good down from above, love.
Help the weak if you are strong now, love.
We don't need no trouble.
What we need is love, oh, no!
We don't need, we don't need, no more trouble!
Lord knows, we don't need no trouble!
We don't need, we don't need trouble, no more trouble, no more trouble, no more trouble!
Seek happiness, oh!
Come on you all, and speak of love, oh, yeah!
We don't need no trouble.
What we need is love, now. 
What we need is love!
We don't need, oh, we don't need no more trouble!
We don't need, no, we don't need no trouble!
We don't need, no, brothers and sisters, no more trouble!
We don't need no trouble!
We don't need no trouble!
We don't need no trouble!
What we need is love!
We don't need, we don't need no more, we don't need no more trouble.
We don't need no more trouble!
Trouble we don't need, we don't need.
We don't need Lord knows!
we don't need no more war, no more trouble.
No more trouble, we don't need no more, more trouble!
