#Pleasure Seeker

Well, here I come.
I'm on a run.
Who wants to fight temptation, that's no fun.
C'mon and play the games.
Don't you feel no shame.
That's what Eve said to Adam before she came.
You can smile now, cry later on.
You know that it might be wrong, but it feels so good, lIke you knew it would.
There's damnation and disgrace.
And guilt rears its ugly face, yet you beg for more, just a little more.
Stand in line.
Don't you lose your mind.
Try like me to seek your pleasure, three at a time.
There's souls for sale.
You're going to burn in Hell.
And if tomorrow never comes, it's just as well.
You can smile now, cry later on.
You know that it must be wrong, but it feels so good, like you knew it would.
There's damnation and disgrace.
And guilt rears its ugly face, yet you beg for more, just a little more.
Uah.
Feel the pain.
I feel it too.
Have your hedonistic ways, got the best of you?
Playing the games.
Don't feel no shame.
That's what Eve said to Adam before she came
You can smile now, cry later on.
You know that it's definitely wrong, but it feels so good, like you know it would.
There's damnation and disgrace.
And guilt rears its ugly face, yet you beg for more, jUst a little more.
Come on and beg for more, just a little more.
