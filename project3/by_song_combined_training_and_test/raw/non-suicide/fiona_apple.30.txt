#The Way Things Are

I wouldn't know what to do with another chance if you gave it to me.
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance.
It'd race right through me.
I'm much better off the way things are.
Much, much better off, better by far, by far.
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice.
It'd roll right past me.
And if you chalk it up you'll see I don't really have a choice so don't even ask me.
I'm much better off the way things are.
Much, much better off, better by far.
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on, and I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle, and as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be able to move on.
How can I fight, when we're on the same side?
How can I fight beside you?
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep on kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle, and as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be able to move on.
So keep on callng me names, keep on, keep on.
And I'll keep kicking the crap till it's gone.
If you keep on killing, you could get me to settle, and as soon as I settle, I bet I'll be able to move on.
