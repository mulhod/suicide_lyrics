#You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go

I've seen love go by my door.
it's never been this close before.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I been shooting in the dark too long.
when something's not right, it's wrong.
You're going to make me lonesome when you go.
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love.
It always has hit me from below, but this time around it's more correct, right on target, so direct.
You're going to make me lonesome when you go.
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face, you could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinking of.
you might be spoiling me too much, love.
You're going to make me lonesome when you go.
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy, crickets talking back and forth in rhyme, blue river running slow and lazy, I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Situations have ended sad.
relationships have all been bad.
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's, but there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair.
You're going to make me lonesome when you go.
You're going to make me wonder what I'm doing, staying far behind without you.
You're going to make me wonder what I'm saying.
You're going to make me give myself a good talking-to.
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula.
You're going to have to leave me now, I know.
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love.
You're going to make me lonesome when you go.
