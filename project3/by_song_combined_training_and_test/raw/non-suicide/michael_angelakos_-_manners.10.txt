#Seaweed Song

Some day you'll see, surrounded by angels, floating atop of the sea.
Abandon me.
Don't go where they go.
Don't sing all the songs they sing.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do. but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Between these walls her back, strange glimpse, casts shadows frighteningly tall.
I slow to a crawl.
I jump and I yell, but she hears nothing at all.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, ut I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Stay, stay the same beause everything else will change and I've always been to blame, so please just stay the same.
The currents pull me in.
The tide has reached my chin.
The seaweed tickles skin.
Just let the water win.
I'm freezing to the bone.
You'll never be at home.
Just watch, you're running out.
Just watch your body go.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
Nobody knows you the way you know you, but I think I do, but I thought I knew.
Yeah, I thought I knew.
