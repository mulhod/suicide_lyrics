#Kaya

Wake up and, wake up and, wake up and turn I loose, for the rain is falling.
Got to have kaya now.
Got to have kaya now.
Got to have kaya now, for the rain is falling.
I'm so high, I even touch the sky above the falling rain.
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so here I come again.
Got to have kaya now.
Got to have kaya now.
Got to have kaya now, for the rain is falling.
Feeling irie I.
Feeling irie I.
Feeling irie I because I have some kaya now.
I feel so high, I even touch the sky above the falling rain.
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so here I come again.
Got to have kaya now.
Got to have kaya now.
Got to have kaya now, for the rain is falling.
Wake up and turn I loose.
Wake up and turn I loose.
Wake up and turn I loose, for the rain is falling.
Kaya now, kaya, kaya.
Kaya now, kaya, kaya.
Kaya now, kaya, kaya.
