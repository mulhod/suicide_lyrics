#We've Got a Groovy Thing Going

Bad news, bad news!
I heard you're packing to leave!
I come a-running right over.
I just couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.
Oh, baby, baby, you must be out of your mind.
Do you know what you're kicking away?
We've got a groovy thing going, baby.
We've got a groovy thing.
I never done you no wrong.
I never hit you when you're down.
I always gave you good loving.
I never ran around.
I never ran around.
Oh, baby, baby, you must be out of your mind.
Do you know what you're kicking away?
We've got a groovy thing going, baby.
We've got a groovy thing.
There's something you ought to know if you're fixing to go.
I can't make it without you.
No no no no, no, no, no, no.
No no no no, no, no, no.
Oh, baby, baby, you must be out of your mind.
Do you know what you're kicking away?
We've got a groovy thing going, baby.
We've got a groovy thing.
We've got a groovy thing going, baby.
We've got a groovy thing.
