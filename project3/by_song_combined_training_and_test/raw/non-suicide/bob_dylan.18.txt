We'll go out and see it sometime.

Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you.
"It's bad for your health," he said.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders.
I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head, your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend.
no, I never seen him before.
Well, I saw you making love with him.
you forgot to close the garage door.
