#Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)

Sweet as the smell of success, her body's warm and wet.
She gets me through this god-awful loneliness, a natural high butterfly, Oh I, I need, need, need her.
Just like a willow tree, a breath of spring, you see, and, oh, boy, you don't know what she do to me.
She makes me sweat and forget who I am.
I need, need, need, need her .
Well, I was wondering how long this could go on, on and on.
Well, I thought I could never be surprised.
But could it be that I bit my own tongue?
Oh, yeah, it's so hard to swallow when you're wrong.
A bird of paradise, the sunrise in her eyes.
God only knows such a sweet surprise.
I was blind.
she blew my mind.
think that I, I love, love, love, love, love her.
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her .
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love.
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love.
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love.
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love.
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love.
