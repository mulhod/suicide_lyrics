#blodwyn i put away the knife , the chisel , and the see . 
i 've lock away me life behind this old oak door to make a simple spoon , a token of me love in hope this maybe soon it 's me you 're think of . 
so take me spoon , blodwyn . 
make it soon , blodwyn . 
the valley know the way i feel today . 
so take me spoon , blodwyn . 
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon take you away . 
me life may not be long , be work down below for so much can go wrong , but what else do i know ? 
so take this precious year and make they precious too and say you 'll take from me what i will give to you . 
take me spoon , blodwyn . 
make it soon , blodwyn . 
the valley know the way i feel today . 
take me spoon , blodwyn . 
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon take you away . 
take me spoon , blodwyn . 
make it soon , blodwyn . 
valley know the way i feel today . 
take me spoon , blodwyn . 
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon take you away .
