# no name # 5th get bite fingernail and a head full of the past and everybody 's go at last . 
a sweet , sweet smile this 's fade fast because everybody 's go at last . 
and you do n't get upset about it , no not anymore . 
there 's nothing wrong this be n't wrong before . 
have a second alone with a chance let pass and everybody 's go at last . 
well , i hope you 're not wait , wait around for me because i 'm not go anywhere , obviously . 
get a break heart and you name on me cast and everybody 's go at last . 
everybody 's go at last .
