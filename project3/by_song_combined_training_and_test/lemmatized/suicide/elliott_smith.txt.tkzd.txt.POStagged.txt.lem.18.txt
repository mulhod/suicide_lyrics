#coming up rose i 'm a junkyard full of false start and i do n't need you permission to bury me love under this bare lightbulb . 
the moon be a sickle cell . 
it 'll kill you in time . 
you cold , white brother ride you blood like spin glass in sore eye while the moon do it division . 
you 're bury below and you 're come up rose . 
everywhere you go red rose follow . 
the thing this you tell you , they 'll kill you in time . 
you cold white brother alive in you blood , spin in the night sky while the moon do it division . 
you 're bury below and you 're come up rose . 
everywhere you go red rose . 
so you get in a kind of trouble this nobody know and you 're come up rose . 
everywhere you go red rose .
