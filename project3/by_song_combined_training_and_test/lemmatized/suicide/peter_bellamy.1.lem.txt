the ballad of henry & susannah , pt . 
1st come all you gentle people and listen to me tale , concern a poor convict . 
from suffolk he do hail . 
for fourteen year transport , as you shall understand for to lead a poor and wretched life upon van diemen 's land . 
young henry cabell be he name , and in mendham he do dwell . 
he poor but honest parent , they rear he right well till cruel hardship overcome they and he father in despair to fee he family do embark upon a wild career .
