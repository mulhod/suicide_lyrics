#wilderness i travel far and wide throguh many different time . 
what do you see there ? 
i see the saint with they toy . 
what do you see there ? 
i see all knowledge destroy . 
i travel far and wide through many different time . 
i travel far and wide through prison of the cross . 
what do you see there ? 
the power and glory of sin . 
what do you see there ? 
the blood of christ on they skin . 
i travel far and wide through many different time . 
i travel far and wide and unknown martyr die . 
what do you see there ? 
i see the one-sided trial . 
what do you see there ? 
i see the tear as they cry . 
they have tear in they eye , tear in they eye , tear in they eye , tear in they eye .
