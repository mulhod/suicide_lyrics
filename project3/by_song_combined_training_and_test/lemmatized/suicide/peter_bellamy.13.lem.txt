# the plymouth mail the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
when i be a lad i use to play by the roadside all the live-long day , hope always to espy the gentry 's coach roll by . 
when i be a youth i use to roam with a waggoner from town to town , but i long to fly across the land on a stagecoach high with a four-in-hand . 
now i be grow unto a man on the driver 's box i take me stand . 
like the captain bold of a ship of sail , i 'm the man who drive the plymouth mail . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
with six on top and four inside , the post-poy and the guard beside , they bag and baggage safely stow , it 's time to take the open road . 
then the hooves do fly , and the wheel spin round and we bid adieu to plymouth town . 
plympton , brent , and ashburton pass , and to exeter we come at last . 
then the horse blow , and they side do steam , as the ostler run to change the team . 
the traveller gulp a glass of ale then back they scramble on the plymouth mail . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
we roll across the dorset down and stage again in shaftesbury town . 
then i crack me whip with may and main , and on we roll to salisbury plain . 
soon over hounslow heath we fly where the gibbet loom against the sky . 
and the passenger all hide they gold for fear we meet some robber bold . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
at the sign of the standard in cornhill , at last me rumble wheel be still . 
and the passenger all stiff and sore thank god they journey 's safely over . 
in a cozy parlor now i stand with a goodly bumper to me hand , and the traveller drink a glass of ale to the health of the driver of the plymouth mail . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail .
