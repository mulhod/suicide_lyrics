#paper cut when i 'm feel tire , he push food through the door and i crawl toward the crack of light . 
sometime i ca n't find me way . 
newspaper spread around , soak all this they can . 
a clean be due again , a good hose down . 
the lady who i feel maternal love for can look me in the eye , but i see he and they be blue and they cock and twitch and masturbate ! 
i say so . 
i say so . 
i say so . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
black window of paint i scratch with me nail . 
i see others just like me . 
why do they not try to escape ? 
they bring out the old one . 
they point in me way . 
they come with a flash of light and take me family away . 
and very late i have learn to accept some friend of ridicule . 
me whole existence be for you amusement and this be why i 'm here with you , to take me with . 
you 're right . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana . 
nirvana .
