# the ballad of the carpenter jesus be a work man and a hero you will hear , bear in the town of bethlehem at the turn of the year , at the turn of the year . 
when jesus be a little lad , street ring with he name for he argue with the old man and put they all to shame . 
he put they all to shame . 
he become a wander journeyman and he travel far and wide and he notice how wealth and poverty live always side by side , live always side by side . 
so he say , " come , all you work man , farmer and weaver , too . 
if you will only stand as one , this world belong to you . 
this world belong to you " when the rich man hear what the carpenter have do , to the roman troop they run , say put this rebel jesus down . 
he 's a menace to god and man . 
he 's a menace to god and man . 
the commander of the occupy troop just laugh and then he say , " there 's a cross to spare on calvary hill . 
by the weekend he 'll be dead . 
by the weekend he 'll be dead . 
" now , jesus walk among the poor for the poor be he own kind and they 'd never let they get near enough to take he from behind , to take he from behind . 
so they hire one of the trader ' trade and an informer be he and he sell he brother to the butcher 's man for a fistful of silver money , for a fistful of silver money . 
and jesus sit in the prison cell and they beat he and offer he bribe to desert the cause of he fellow man and work for the rich man 's tribe , to work for the rich man 's tribe . 
and the sweat stand out on jesus 's brow and the blood be in he eye when they nail he body to the roman cross and they laugh as they watch he die . 
they laugh as they watch he die . 
two thousand year have pass and go , many a hero , too , but the dream of this poor carpenter remain in the hand of you , remain in the hand of you .
