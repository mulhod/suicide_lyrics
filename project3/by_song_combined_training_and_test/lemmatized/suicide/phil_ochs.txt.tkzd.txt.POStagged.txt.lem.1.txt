do what i have to do all around this country , trouble in the air and i hear the voice call me , ask , "do you know and do you care ? 
do you know and do you care ? 
" so i 'm go to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm go to be what i have to be . 
now , wo n't you come on along with me ? 
wo n't you come along with me ? 
do n't want to cause no sorrow . 
do n't want to cause no pain . 
i 'm only go to cause what i have to cause until this land be free of shame , till this land be free of shame . 
so i 'm go to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm go to be what i have to be . 
now , wo n't you come on along with me ? 
wo n't you come along with me ? 
only one thing i know , i know we 're not alone . 
be a million here before we come . 
be a million when we 're go , we 're go , million when we 're go . 
so i 'm go to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm go to be what i have to be . 
now , wo n't you come on along with me ? 
wo n't you come along with me ? 
oh , i 'm afraid of trouble . 
yes , i 'm afraid of jail . 
but i 'm more afraid , lord , not to try , more afraid of what happen now if we fail , what happen now if we fail . 
so i 'm go to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm go to be what i have to be . 
now , wo n't you come on along with me ? 
wo n't you come along with me ?
