#let 's get lose i 've be outside , invite in , but i can n't abide , will n't miss it again . 
burn every bridge this i cross to find some beautiful place to get lose . 
i have true love . 
i make it die . 
i push he away . 
he say , please stay . 
burn every bridge this i cross to find some beautiful place to get lose , to find some beautiful place to get lose . 
well , i do n't know where i 'll go now and i do n't really care who follow me there , but i 'll burn every bridge this i cross and find some beautiful place to get lose and find some beautiful place to get lose .
