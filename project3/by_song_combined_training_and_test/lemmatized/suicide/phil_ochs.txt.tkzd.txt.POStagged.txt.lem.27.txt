#bound for glory he walk all over he own grow land from the new york island to the california sand .

and now he 's bind for a glory all he own and now he be bind for glory . 
he write and he sing and he ride upon the rail and he get on board when the sailor have to sail . 
he say all the word this need to be say . 
he feed all the hungry soul this need to be feed . 
and now he 's bind for a glory all he own and now he be bind for glory .

and now he 's bind for a glory all he own and now he be bind for glory . 
and it 's "pastures of plenty" , write the dustbowl balladeer . 
and " this land be you land " he want we to hear . 
and the rise of the union will be sing about again and the deportee live on through the power of he pen . 
and now he 's bind for a glory all he own and now he be bind for glory . 
now they sing out he praise on every distant shear , but so few remember what he be fight for .

he write they for a reason . 
why not sing they for the same ? 
and now he 's bind for a glory all he own and now he be bind for glory .
