# first timer i 'm a first timer , wish i be someone else when i see you by you in a corridor where you find you now block by a door you lock . 
you wo n't do what the doctor order . 
you wo n't see someone else . 
come on back to me , me bright tomorrow . 
you say you feel hollow and you know it 's because you be , well , at less so far . 
i think of you with hesitation . 
i think of you too hard . 
come on back to me , but do n't make me sorry . 
i 'm a first timer , wish i 'd be someone else , see you by you , see you by you .
