# no matter what no matter what you be i will always be with you . 
do n't matter what you do , girl . 
oh , girl , with you . 
no matter what you do i will always be around . 
wo n't you tell me what you find , girl ? 
oh , girl , wo n't you ? 
knock down the old gray wall and be a part of it all . 
nothing to say . 
nothing to see . 
nothing to do . 
if you will give me all as i will give it to you , nothing will be , nothing will be , nothing will be . 
no matter where you go there will always be a place . 
ca n't you see it in me face , girl ? 
oh , girl , want you . 
knock down the old gray wall . 
be a part of it all . 
nothing to say . 
nothing to see . 
nothing to do . 
if you will give me all as i will give it to you , nothing will be , nothing will be , nothing will be . 
no matter what you be i will always be with you .
