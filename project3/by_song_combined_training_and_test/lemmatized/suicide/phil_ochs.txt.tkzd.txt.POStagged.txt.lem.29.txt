# what 's this i hear what 's this i hear now ring in me ear ? 
i 've hear this sound before . 
what 's this i hear now ring in me ear ? 
i hear it more and more . 
it 's the sound of freedom call , ring up to the sky . 
it 's the sound of the old way fall . 
you can hear it if you try . 
you can hear it if you try . 
what 's this i see now shine in me eye ? 
i 've see this light before . 
what 's this i see now shine in me eye ? 
i see it more and more . 
it 's the light of freedom shine , shine up to the sky . 
it 's the light of the old way dying . 
you can see it if you try what 's this i feel now beat in me heart ? 
i 've feel this beat before . 
what 's this i feel now beat in me heart ? 
i feel it more and more . 
it 's the rumble of freedom call , climb up to the sky . 
it 's the rumble of the old way fall . 
you can feel it if you try .
