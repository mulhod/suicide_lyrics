#ballad of big nothing throw candy out to the crowd drag down the main , the helpless little thing with the dirty mouth who 's always get something to say . 
you 're sit at home now wait for you brother to call . 
i see he down at the alley have have enough of it all . 
say you can do what you want to whenever you want to . 
you can do what you want to . 
there 's no one to stop you . 
all spit and spite , you 're up all night and down every day , a tire man with only hour to go just wait to be take away , get in to the back of a car for candy from some stranger , watch the parade with pinpoint eye full of smolder anger . 
you can do what you want to whenever you want to . 
you can do what you want to . 
there 's no one to stop you . 
now you can do what you want to whenever you want to , do what you want to whenever you want to , do what you want to whenever you want to though it do n't mean a thing , big nothing .
