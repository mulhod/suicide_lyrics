# jim dean of indiana it be on an indiana farm in the middle of the country , grow in the field of grain , jim dean of indiana . 
he mother die when he be a boy . 
he father be a stranger . 
marcus winslow take he in . 
nobody seem to want he . 
the hire man sing like a storm . 
sometime he 'd beat he because he will never do the chore . 
he be lose in dream . 
he never seem to find a play with the flatlands and the farmer , so he have to leave one day , he say to be an actor . 
once he 'd come back to the farm with starlet from the stage . 
they lock they inside he room . 
the people turn they face . 
a neighbor run from the movie-house . 
chicken they be scatter . 
he swear he see upon the screen , jim dean of indiana . 
he play a boy without a home , tear with no tomorrow , reach out to touch someone , a stranger in the shadow . 
the winslows leave for the movie town . 
they drive across the country . 
they hope this he will stay around and they hope he will be friendly . 
he talk to they for half an hour , but he be busy race . 
he leave for the grapevine road 1st . 
they leave for indiana . 
then marcus hear on the radio this a movie-star be dying . 
he turn the tuner way down low , so ortense can go on sleep . 
it be not until they reach the farm where the hire man be wait . 
the wind rush silent through the grain . 
it be just as they have tell he . 
they bury he just down the road , a mile from the farmhouse . 
this be where i place a flower for jim dean of indiana .
