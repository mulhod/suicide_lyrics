#decades here be the young man , the weight on they shoulder . 
here be the young man . 
well , where have they be ? 
we knock on the door of hell 's dark chamber . 
push to the limit , we drag we in . 
watch from the wing as the scene be replay . 
we see we now as we never have see . 
portrayal of the trauma and degeneration , the sorrow we suffer and never be free . 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
weary inside , now we heart 's lose forever . 
ca n't replace the fear or the thrill of the chase . 
each ritual show up . 
the door for we wandering open , then shut , then slam in we face . 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ?
