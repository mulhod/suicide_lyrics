#blind owl lie , tie , mr . 
cool disguise . 
hang it up . 
get up on you own . 
pill-driven skill , weep whip-poor-wills . 
too much go around this you ca n't hide . 
look out for the blind owl . 
you can only find this you be wrong . 
no one else around me ever love me like you do , so i 'll be strong . 
look out for the blind owl . 
you can only find this you be wrong . 
no one else around me ever love me like you do , so i 'll be strong . 
day , play , interviewer 's maze . 
play the role . 
sell you soul . 
become to you , a hero who must never lie . 
who must never lie ? 
who must never lie ? 
who must never lie ? 
who must never lie ? 
who must never lie ? 
who must never lie ?
