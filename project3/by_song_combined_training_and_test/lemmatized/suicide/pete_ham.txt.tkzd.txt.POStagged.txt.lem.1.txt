apple of me eye oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to move away though inside me heart , i really want to stay . 
believe the love we have be so sincere . 
you know , the gift you have will always be . 
you 're the apple of me eye . 
you 're the apple of me heart , but now the time have come to part . 
oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to make a stand though we never mean to bite the love hand . 
and now the time have come to walk alone . 
we be the child . 
now we 've overgrow . 
you 're the apple of me eye . 
you 're the apple of me heart , but now the time have come to part . 
oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to move away though inside me heart , i really want to stay . 
believe the love we have be so sincere . 
you know , the gift you have will always be . 
you 're the apple of me eye . 
you 're the apple of me heart , but now the time have come to part . 
now the time have come to part . 
now the time have come to part .
