#day of the lord this be the room , the start of it all , no portrait so fine , only sheet on the wall . 
i 've see the night fill with blood-sport and pain and the body obtain , the body obtain . 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
this be you friend from childhood , through youth , who goad you on , demand more proof . 
withdrawal pain be hard . 
it can do you right in , so distort and thin , distort and thin . 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
this be the car at the edge of the road . 
there 's nothing disturb . 
all the window be close . 
i guess you be right when we talk in the heat . 
there 's no room for the weak , no room for the weak . 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
this be the room , the start of it all . 
through childhood , thrugh youth , i remember it all . 
oh , i 've see the night fill with blood-sport and pain and the body obtain , the body obtain , the body obtain . 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ? 
where will it end ?
