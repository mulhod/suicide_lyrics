#floyd the barber bell on door clank . 
come on in . 
floyd observe me hairy chin . 
sit down in the chair . 
do n't be afraid . 
steam hot towel on me face . 
i 'm ashamed . 
i 'm ashamed . 
i 'm ashamed . 
barney tie me to the chair . 
i ca n't see . 
i 'm really scare . 
floyd breathe hard . 
i hear a zip . 
pee-pee press against me lip . 
i be shame . 
i be shame . 
i be shame . 
i sense others in the room . 
opie aunt bee , i presume . 
they take turn and cut me up . 
i die smother in andy 's clutch . 
i be shame . 
i be shame . 
i be shame .
