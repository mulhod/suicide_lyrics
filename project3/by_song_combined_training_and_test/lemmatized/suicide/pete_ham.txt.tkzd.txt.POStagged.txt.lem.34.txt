#meanwhile back at the ranch why do you think me so hard to get ? 
be there something they may regret ? 
be it well to just forget , just forget ? 
if they only will let we know , then we 'd know just how far to go , but instead they just tell we "no" , tell we "no" . 
you , you always play the fool . 
you always play the fool . 
you always break the rule at every single school , you know . 
you always break the rule . 
it always pull you down . 
they can always pull you down . 
you , you never stay the same . 
you never stay the same and now you take the blame for all the little game they play . 
you always take the blame and let it bring you down . 
why 'd you let it bring you down ?
