#almost over think i 'm unkind ? 
the people be n't the way you think they be . 
they ca n't remember all the time what it be you want . 
they paint you out in straight silhouette , but do n't you get the picture yet ? 
why you get all upset ? 
the worst part be almost over . 
three 's such a crowd . 
you ought to tell me what you tell you . 
you ever go to speak it aloud ? 
do i have to guess like everyone else ? 
with an iron will to walk the walk and the glass jaw this ca n't be move to talk , black eye always watch the clock . 
the worst part be almost over . 
you let you be freeze by death . 
you think i 'm mean because i call you out . 
you do n't know what you 're about . 
the worst part be almost over now . 
the worst part be almost over now , now , now .
