# the eternal procession move on . 
the shout be over . 
praise to the glory of love one now go . 
talk aloud as they sit around they table , scatter flower wash down by the rain . 
stand by the gate at the foot of the garden , watch they pass like cloud in the sky . 
try to cry out in the heat of the moment , possess by a fury this burn from inside . 
cry like a child , though this year make me old . 
with child me time be so wastefully spend , a burden to keep , though they inner communion . 
accept like a curse , an unlucky deal . 
play by the gate at the foot of the garden . 
me view stretch out from the fence to the wall . 
no word can explain . 
no action determine . 
just watch the tree and the leave as they fall .
