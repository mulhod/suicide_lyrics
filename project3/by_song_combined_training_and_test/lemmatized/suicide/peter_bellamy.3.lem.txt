# the robber 's song me name be abe carman . 
me trade it be right charm , for you know there be no harm in a little burglary . 
i live by take chance , like the hero of romance , and take what i fancy with bold audacity ! 
there 's wealth all for the take , and there be no mistake , me fortune i be make with a little robbery . 
no man shall be me master as long as i run fast than this this will me blast for take thing for free ! 
i 've rob the great and wealthy in manner sly and stealthy , but it 's just to keep me healthy as you can plainly see . 
no watch , no ring , no clock it be not safe within you pocket , and it will avail you naught to lock it from light-fingered gentry !
