#baby britain baby britain feel the well float over a sea of vodka , separate from the rest . 
fight problem with big problem . 
see the ocean fall and rise . 
count the wave this somehow do n't hit he . 
water pour from he eye , alcoholic and very bitter . 
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art . 
you put you apart and i ca n't help until you start . 
we knock another couple back , the dead soldier line up on the table still prepare for an attack . 
they do n't know they 'd be disable . 
feel a wave , a rush of blood . 
you wo n't be happy till the bottle 's break and you 're out swim in the flood you keep back , you keep unspoken . 
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art . 
you put you apart and i ca n't help until you start . 
you get a look in you eye when you 're say goodbye like you want to say hi . 
the light be on , but it be dim . 
revolver 's be turn over and now it 's ready once again . 
the radio be play " crimson and clover " . 
london bridge be safe and sound . 
no matter what you keep repeat , nothing 's go to drag me down to a death this 's not worth cheat . 
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art . 
you put you apart and i ca n't help until you start . 
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art . 
you put you apart .
