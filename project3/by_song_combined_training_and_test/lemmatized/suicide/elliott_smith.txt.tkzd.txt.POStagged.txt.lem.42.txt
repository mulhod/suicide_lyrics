#pretty (ugly before ) sunshine be keep me up for day . 
there be no night-time , it 's only a pass phase . 
and i feel pretty , pretty enough for you . 
i feel so ugly before .

be it destruction this you require to feel , like somebody want you , someone this 's more for real ? 
sunshine be keep me up for day . 
there be no night-time , only a pass phase . 
and i 'll feel pretty another hour or two . 
i feel so ugly before . 
i do n't know what to do . 
i feel so ugly before . 
i do n't know what to do . 
i feel so ugly before . 
i do n't know what to do .
