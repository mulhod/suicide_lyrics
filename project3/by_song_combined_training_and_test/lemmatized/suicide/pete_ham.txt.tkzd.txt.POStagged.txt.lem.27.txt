#take it all in a way , the sun have shine on me . 
make it easy to make it hard . 
take an inch , take a yard , take it all . 
i do n't need it at all . 
any day the sun can shine on you . 
make it silly to make it bad . 
take it good , take it glad , take it all . 
do n't you know there 's a strong thing keep we together ? 
do n't you know there 's a song to sing ? 
sing on . 
let the feel take you high . 
do n't you know there 's a strong thing keep we together ? 
do n't you know there 's a song to sing ?

let the feel take you high . 
any day , the sun will shine on you . 
make it silly to take it bad . 
make it good , take it glad , take it all . 
i do n't need it at all . 
i do n't want it at all . 
no , no , no .
