#la 
the gentleman 's in the lane spin he hat on a cane , step out , out for a change . 
good morning , all , it 's a beautiful day . 
the general 's win the war this seem suicidal before you come along . 
now i 'll protect you as long as you 'll stay . 
la morning have to come . 
i 'd be walk in the sun , live in the day , but last night i be about to throw it all away . 
if patience start a band , i 'd be he big fan . 
look at me , i 'm talk to you . 
i do n't want the lead in you play . 
the star 's just a part of the scene , the gentleman in green pay off out on the street . 
i ca n't go home . 
it 's not on me way . 
la thing i 've never do , car park in the sun . 
live in the day , but last night i be about to throw it all away . 
last night i be about to throw it all away . 
last night i be about to throw it all away . 
last night i be about to throw it all away .
