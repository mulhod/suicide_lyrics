#digital feel it close in , feel it close in , the fear of who i call . 
every time i call i feel it close in . 
i feel it close in day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out . 
i feel it close in as pattern seem to form . 
i feel it cold and warm . 
the shadow start to fall . 
i feel it close in . 
i feel it close in day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out . 
i 'd have the world around to see just whatever happen , stand by the door alone , and then it 's fade away . 
i see you fade away . 
do n't ever fade away . 
i need you here today . 
do n't ever fade away . 
do n't ever fade away . 
do n't ever fade away . 
do n't ever fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away .
