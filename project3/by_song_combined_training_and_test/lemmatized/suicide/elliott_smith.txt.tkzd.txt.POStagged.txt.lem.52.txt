#little one one more little one . 
i 'll go down , stay down , sleep the rest of the day , dream new music to calm down , stay down and keep evil away . 
i can hear you asleep change you shape , dissolve in some dream as a new one appear to take you along where you 've never be . 
one , two , three , four , five , six . 
the moonlight tonight seem to belong to me because , even though some ca n't sleep , i need some company . 
one hit will n't hurt a bite at all . 
slow down , sleep. what 's . 
if it 's good shit , you wo n't know . 
and i wo n't know the fact this i 'm dying if i seem to be reckless with me . 
it 's the fault of no one . 
all thing have a place under the moon as well as the sun . 
one more little one . 
i love you .
