#miss misery i 'll fake it through the day with some help from johnny walker red and the cold pain behind me eye this shoot back through me head , with two ticket tear in half and a lot of nothing to do , but it 's alright because some enchant night i 'll be with you . 
tarot card and the line in me hand tell me i 'm wrong , but then untrue . 
get plan for both of we this involve a trip out of town to a place i 've see in a magazine this you leave lie around . 
i ca n't hold me liquor , but i keep a good attitude because it 's alright . 
some enchant night i 'll be with you and , though you 'd rather see me go than to see this , come the day i 'll be wait for you , anyway . 
next door the tv 's flash blue frame on the wall . 
it 's a comedy from the 70th 's with a lead no one recall , vanish into oblivion . 
it 's easy to do . 
and i cry to sleep when you talk to me the day you say we be through , but it 's alright . 
some enchant night i 'll be with you .
