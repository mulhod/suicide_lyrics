#twilight have n't laugh this hard in a long time . 
i well stop now before i start cry . 
go off to sleep in the sunshine . 
i do n't want to see the day when it 's dying . 
he 's a sight to see . 
he 's good to me . 
i 'm already somebody 's baby . 
he 's a pretty thing and he know everything , but i 'm already somebody 's baby . 
you do n't deserve to be lonely , but this drug you get wo n't make you feel well . 
pretty soon you 'll find it 's the only little part of you life you 're keep together . 
i 'm nice to you . 
i can make it through this you 're already somebody 's baby . 
i can make you smile if you stay awhile , but how long will you stay with me , baby ? 
because you candle burn too bright . 
well , i almost forget it be twilight . 
even if i think this you be right , well , i 'm tire of be down . 
i get no fight . 
you 're wonderful when it 's beautiful , but i 'm already somebody 's baby and , if i wend with you , i 'd disappoint you too . 
well , i 'm already somebody 's baby , already somebody 's baby .
