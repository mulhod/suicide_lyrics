" #i well be quiet now wish you give me you number . 
wish i can call you today , just to hear a voice . 
i get a long way to go . 
i 'm get further away . 
if i do n't know the difference , live alone 'd probably be okay . 
it will n't be lonely . 
i get a long way to go . 
i 'm get further away . 
a lot of hour to occupy , it be easy when i do n't know you yet , thing i 'd have to forget , but i well be quiet now . 
i 'm tire of waste me breath , carry on , and get upset . 
maybe i get a problem , but this 's not what i want to say . 
i 'd prefer to say nothing . 
i get a long way to go . 
i 'm get further away . 
have a dream as an army man with an order just to march in me place while a dead enemy scream in me face , but i well be quiet now . 
i 'm tire of waste me breath , carry on , not over it yet . 
wish i know what you 're do and why you want to do it this way , so i ca n't go the distance . 
i get a long way to go . 
i 'm get further away . 
i get a long way to go . 
i 'm get further away .
