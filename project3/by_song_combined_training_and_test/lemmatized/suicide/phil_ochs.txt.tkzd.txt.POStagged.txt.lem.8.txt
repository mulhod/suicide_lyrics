# i 'll be there when the river of rebellion overflow , i 'll be there . 
when the seed of discontent plant and grow , i 'll be there , watch for the sun through the dark and rainy storm , search for the key to the dungeon old and wear . 
let me tell you . 
i 'll be there . 
when the shadow of the tyrant fall and sweep across the land , when man will steal from others with paper in they hand , when people search for answer and the answer never come , when they trouble will be over if they think and fight as one , let me tell you . 
i 'll be there . 
whisper of yesterday have grow into a roar , wind of freedom blow out of every distant shear . 
when the time be ready and the call be loud and clearly , let me tell you . 
i 'll be there . 
when the thunder of oppression roar and crackle , i 'll be there . 
when this who will be free be wear shackle , i 'll be there for the day be go to come when they 'll throw away they chain , lift they head and raise they arm for the struggle this remain and let me tell you . 
i 'll be there . 
whisper of yesterday have turn into a roar , wind of freedom blow out of every distant shear . 
when the time be ready and the call be loud and clearly , let me tell you . 
i 'll be there . 
when the thunder of opression roar and crackle , i 'll be there . 
when this who will be free be wear shackle , i 'll be there for the day be go to come when they 'll throw away they chain , lift they head and raise they arm for the struggle this remain and let me tell you , let me tell you , let me tell you , let me tell you . 
i 'll be there .
