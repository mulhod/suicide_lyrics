#going nowhere he wave hello , silent like a mime . 
there 's no change me mind . 
i wo n't walk the stair with you tonight go nowhere . 
the clock move a quarter of a turn , the time it take a cigarette to burn . 
he say , you get a lot of thing to learn go nowhere . 
see you move a certain way , miss you a lot , return to this abandon place , should 've be forget . 
echo drown the conversation out , echo this only seem to bring about a silent expression , thing you may allow , go nowhere . 
the step make a pattern i 'd never see . 
i feel like a kid of six or seventeen . 
i be off in some empty daydream go nowhere . 
it 's dead and go , matter of fact . 
maybe for the well . 
say some thing you ca n't take back honestly , i guess . 
the old record sit on the floor , the one i ca n't put on anymore . 
he walk over to he like before go nowhere , go nowhere , go nowhere .
