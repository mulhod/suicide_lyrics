#that 's what i want to hear oh , you tell me this you last good dollar be go and you say this you pocket be bare . 
and you tell me this you clothe be tattered and tear and nobody seem to care . 
now , do n't tell me you trouble . 
no , i do n't have the time to spare . 
but , if you want to get together and fight , good buddy , this 's what i want to hear . 
and you tell me this you job be take away by a big old greasy machine . 
and you tell me this you do n't collect no more pay and you belly be grow lean . 
now , if i have the job to give , you know i 'd give they all away . 
but do n't waste you breath call out me name if you do n't have nothing to say . 
and you tell me this you do n't have nothing to do and you keep on waste you time . 
and you say when you want to get you family some food , you get to stand in a relief line . 
now , it 's a sin and a bloody shame about the way they 're push you around , but , when you decide not to take no more , you know i 'll put me money down because i 've see you kind many time before and i 'll see they many time again . 
oh , but every bad thing this 's happen to you have happen to well man , so do n't explain this you 've lose you way , this you 've get no place to go . 
you 've get a hand and a voice and you 're not alone .

and , if you 're still wonder what i 'm try to say , let me tell you what it 's all about . 
now , nobody listen to a single man when he 's walk around down and out , so , if you 're look for an answer , he 's stand there by you side and you 'll never really know how far you 'll go till you join together and try . 
so , you tell me this you last good dollar be go and you say this you pocket be bare . 
and you tell me this you clothe be tattered and tear and nobody seem to care . 
now , do n't tell me you trouble . 
no , i do n't have the time to spare . 
but , if you want to get together and fight , good buddy , this 's what i want to hear .
