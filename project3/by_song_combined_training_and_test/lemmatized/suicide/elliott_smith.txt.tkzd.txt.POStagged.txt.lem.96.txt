#bottle up and explode ! 
bottle up and explode over and over , keep the troublemaker below . 
put it away and check out for the day and in for a round of overexposure , the thing mother nature provide to get up and go . 
bottle up and explode , see the star surround you , red , white and blue . 
you look at he like you 've never know he , but i know for a fact this you have . 
the last time you cry , who 'd you think be inside ? 
think this you be about to come over , but i 'm tire now of wait for you . 
you never show . 
bottle up and go . 
if you 're go to hide , it 's up to you . 
i 'm come through . 
bottle up and go . 
i can make it outside . 
i 'll get though become you , become you , become you .
