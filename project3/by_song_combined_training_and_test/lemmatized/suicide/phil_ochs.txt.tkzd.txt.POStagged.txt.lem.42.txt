#in the heat of the summer in the heat of the summer , when the pavement be burn , the soul of a city be ravage in the night after the city sun be sink . 
why , the window be shatter , but deep in the dark someone set the spark and then it no long matter . 
all the temper be rage . 
oh , where , oh , where be the white silver tongue who forget to listen to the warning ? 
no long follow reason and all the store be the target now where just the other day they be buy . 
drink with the lure of the loot and the memory of the uniform shove with they stick , ask , "are you look for trouble ? 
" "it 's not the way of the order . 
oh , stay in you home . 
please leave we alone . 
we 'll be glad to talk in the morning . 
" "why the hurry to you hunger ? 
now the rubble 's rest on you break street , so you see what you rage have unravel " . 
brick be heavily fly and the loudspeaker drown like a whisper sound when compare to the anger emotion . 
and the shame be replace the anger , so wrong , so wrong , but we 've be down so long and we have to make somebody listen in the heat of the summer .
