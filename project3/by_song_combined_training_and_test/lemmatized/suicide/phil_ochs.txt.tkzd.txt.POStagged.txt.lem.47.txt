# the highwayman the wind be a torrent of darkness among the gusty tree . 
the moon be a ghostly galleon toss upon cloudy sea and the road be a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor and the highwayman come ride , ride , ride . 
yes , the highwayman come ride up to the old inn door . 
over the cobble he clatter and clash in the darken yard and he tap with he whip at the window , but all be lock and bar . 
so he whistle a tune to the window and who should be wait there but the landlord 's black-eyed daughter , bess , the landlord 's daughter , plait a dark-red love knot into he long black hair . 
one kiss , me bonny sweetheart , for i 'm after a prize tonight . 
but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light . 
yet if they press me sharply , harry me through the day , oh , then look for me by moonlight . 
watch for me by moonlight and i 'll come to you by moonlight though hell should bar the way . 
he do not come at the dawn . 
no , he do not come at the noon . 
and out of the tawny sunset , before the rise of the moon , when the road be a gypsy 's ribbon loop the purple moor , oh , a redcoat troop come march , march , march , king george 's man come march up to the old inn door and they bind the landlord 's daughter with many a snigger jest and they bind the musket beside he with the barrel beneath he breast . 
now keep good watch . 
and they kiss he . 
he hear the dead man say , "oh , look for me by moonlight . 
watch for me by moonlight and i 'll come to you by moonlight though hell should bar the way . 
" look for me by moonlight , hoof-beats ring clearly . 
watch for me by moonlight . 
be they deaf this they do not hear ? 
for he ride on the gypsy highway . 
he breathe one final breath . 
then he finger move in the moonlight . 
he musket shatter the moonlight and it shatter he breast in the moonlight and warn he with he death . 
oh , he turn . 
he spur on to the west . 
he do not know who stand out with he black hair flow down , drench with he own red blood . 
oh , not till the dawn have he hear it and he face grow gray to hear how bess the landlord 's daughter , the landlord 's black-eyed daughter , have watch for he love in the moonlight and die in the darkness there . 
back he spur like a madman , shriek a curse to the sky with the white road smoke behind he and he rapier brandish high . 
blood-red be he spur in the golden noon , wine-red he velvet coat when they shoot he down on the highway , down like a dog on the highway , and he lie in he blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at he throat . 
and still on a winter 's night they say , when the wind be in the tree , when the moon be a ghostly galleon toss upon cloudy sea , when the road be a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor , oh , the highwayman come ride , ride , ride . 
yes , the highwayman come ride up to the old inn door .
