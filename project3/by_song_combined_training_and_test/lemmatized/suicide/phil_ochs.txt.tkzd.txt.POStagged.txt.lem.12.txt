# i 'm tire sometime i feel this the world be n't me . 
it feed on me hunger and tear on me time . 
and i 'm tire . 
yes , i 'm tire . 
every face on the street be as cold as the air , as hard as the pavement move beneath me foot . 
and i 'm tire . 
yes , i 'm tire . 
sometime i stop and ask to me , oh , why should i be so alone ? 
it come and it go and nobody know for they 're blind with a pain all they own . 
so i start out again with a smile on me face to hide all the empty and search for a friend . 
and i 'm tire . 
yes , i 'm tire .
