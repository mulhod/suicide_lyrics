# good to go a low-riding junkie girl ride down south to you little world like a dream . 
you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to be like me . 
i will n't need a hero if i be n't such a zero , if i be n't such a zero . 
good to go . 
all i ever see around here be thing of he this you leave lie around . 
it 's all i ever see around here . 
he kick new york like a curse and you trace he footstep in reverse up to queen . 
you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to , you can do it if you want to be like me . 
i will n't need a hero if i be n't such a zero , if i be n't such a zero . 
good to go . 
all i ever see around here be thing of he this you leave lie around . 
it 's all i ever see around here , some empty envelope from some other town . 
it 's all i ever see around here , i 'm wait for something this 's not come .
