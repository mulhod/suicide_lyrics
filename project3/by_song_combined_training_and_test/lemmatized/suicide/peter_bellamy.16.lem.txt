#roll down sweet lady of plymouth , we 're say goodbye . 
roll down ! 
but we 'll rock you and roll you again by and by . 
walk he round , me brave boy and roll down ! 
and we will roll down ! 
walk he round , me brave boy and roll down ! 
now the anchor 's aweigh and the sail be unfurl , and we 're bind for to take he half-way round the world . 
in the wide bay of biscay the sea will run high , and the poor sickly transport they 'll wish they can die . 
when the wild coast of africa it do appear , the poor nervous transport they 'll tremble with fear . 
when the cape of good hope it be round at last , the poor lonesome transport they 'll long for the past . 
when the great southern whale on we quarter do spout , the poor simple transport they 'll goggle and shout . 
and when we arrive off australia 's strand , the poor weary transport they 'll long for the land . 
and when we set sail for old england 's shear , the poor strand transport we 'll see they no more . 
then sweet lady of plymouth we 'll pay all you rend , and go rove no more till we money 's all spend .
