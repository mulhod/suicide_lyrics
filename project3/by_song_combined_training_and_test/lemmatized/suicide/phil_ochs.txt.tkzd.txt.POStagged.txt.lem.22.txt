# the bell hear the sledge with the bell , silver bell . 
what a world of merriment they melody foretell . 
how they tinkle , tinkle , tinkle in the icy air of night . 
all the heaven seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight . 
keep time , time , time with a sort of runic rhyme from the tintinnabulation this so musically well from the bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , from the jingle and the tinkle of the bell . 
hear the mellow wed bell , golden bell . 
what a world of happiness they harmony foretell . 
through the balmy air of night how they ring out they delight , through the dance and the yell and the rapture this impel . 
how it swell . 
how it dwell . 
on the future how it tell from the swing and the ring of the melt golden bell , of the bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , of the rhyme and the chime of the bell . 
hear the loud alarum bell , brazen bell . 
what a tale of terror now they turbulency tell . 
much too horrify to speak , oh , they can only shriek for all the ear to know how the danger ebb and flow , leap high , high , high with a desperate desire , in a clamorous appeal to the mercy of the fire , with the bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , with the clamor and the clang of the bell . 
hear the toll of the bell , iron bell . 
what a world of solemn think they monody compel for all the sound this float from the rust within we throat . 
and the people sit and groan in they muffle monotone and the toll , toll , toll feel a glory in the roll from the throb and the sob of the melancholy bell , oh , the bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , bell , oh , the moan and the groan of the bell .
