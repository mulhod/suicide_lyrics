#song of me return the wild geese be dance in the ripple of the morn . 
me wanderlust be form . 
i 've get to follow they wherever they may lead for i be just a sailor on a ship across the land . 
let me hold you hand to bid farewell , so i can knuckle to me knee . 
but i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love this free the fire for burn . 
then i 'll take you in me arm and tell you all i know as i sing the early song of me return . 
the weary world be wait for ambition to be play , now young and not afraid . 
i 've get to challenge every chalice this i know . 
me eager ear be listen for the sing of the sign . 
deep be the line upon the face this find reflection in the road . 
yes , i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love this free the fire for burn . 
then i 'll take you in me arm and tell you all i know as i sing the change song of me return . 
me drift day prepare me to do battle with the night , a phantom of the fight . 
i 've get to conquer all the courage of me fear . 
the answer lie in limbo and the harvest will be hard , but sacred be the scar this leave they mark on the fast disolving year . 
yes , i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love this free the fire for burn . 
then i 'll take you in me arm and tell you all i know as i sing the change song of me return . 
time must have he victory . 
it 's this i 've always know . 
but i win or lose alone . 
and , when a voice call out , " there 's someone you must meet" , with every strength remain i will suffer one more scene . 
i 'll gather all me dream and with me final breath i 'll lie they at you foot . 
yes , i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love this free the fire for burn . 
then i 'll take you in me arm and tell you all i know as i sing the change song of me return .
