#pictures of me start , stop and start . 
stupid act smart . 
flirt with the flick . 
you say it 's just for kick . 
you 'll be the victim of you own dirty trick . 
you get you to tease and displease . 
door swing wide , you walk in to hide . 
look at you foot , failure 's complete . 
see you and me on the coin-op tv freeze in fear every time we appear . 
i 'm not surprise and , really , why should i be ? 
see nothing wrong , see nothing wrong , so sick and tire of all this picture of me . 
completely wrong , totally wrong . 
go walk by . 
here come another guy , jailer who sell personal hell who 'd like to see me down on me fuck knee . 
everybody 's dying just to get the disease . 
hey , hey , hey , hey , i 'm not surprise and , really , why should i be ? 
see nothing wrong , see nothing wrong , so sick and tire of all this picture of me . 
completely wrong , totally wrong . 
i 'm not surprise and , really , why should i be ? 
see nothing wrong , see nothing wrong , so sick and tire of all this picture of me . 
oh , everybody 's dying just to get the disease . 
everybody 's dying just to get the disease . 
everybody 's dying just to get the disease .
