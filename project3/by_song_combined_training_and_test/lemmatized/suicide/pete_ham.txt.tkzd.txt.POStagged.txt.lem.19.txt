#midnight caller beneath the midnight caller he think of paper green . 
you never hear they call he name . 
they just know where they 've be . 
you never hear he holler . 
the tear no long come . 
he read he daily book of the past this show of everyone . 
grey year this show in he hair . 
ca n't be , but do n't seem to care . 
he unlock the door and there 's no one there . 
he see a daytime stroller walk from the night before and , though he paint a smile on he face , he wo n't be back no more . 
he 's get no saint to follow . 
he 's get no place to go . 
too proud to ask an old friend for help . 
too proud to let he know . 
grey year this show in he hair . 
ca n't be , but do n't seem to care . 
he knock the door and there 's no one there . 
nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody 's go to help you now .
