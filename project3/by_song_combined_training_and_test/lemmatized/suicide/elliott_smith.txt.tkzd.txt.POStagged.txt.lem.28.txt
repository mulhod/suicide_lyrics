#everything remind me of he i never really have a problem because of leave , but everything remind me of he this even . 
so , if i seem a little out of it , sorry , but why should i lie ? 
everything remind me of he . 
the spin of the earth impale a silhouette of the sun on the steeple . 
and i get to hear the same sermon all the time now from you people . 
why be you stare into outer space cry just because you come across it and lose it ? 
everything remind me of he . 
everything remind me of he . 
everything remind me of he .
