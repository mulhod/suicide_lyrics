# no name # 1st at a party he be wait , look kind of spooky and withdraw , like he can be underwater , the mighty mother with he hundred arm sweep all aside . 
i hate to walk behind other people 's ambition . 
i see you wait saint-like with you warn . 
leave alone . 
you do n't belong here . 
he get nervous , start whistle , every think a ricochet . 
do you notice ? 
well , i wonder , what 's the worst thing i can say ? 
and i freeze up and sigh . 
you remind me of someone 's daughter . 
i forget he , i forget he name ashamed . 
go home and live with you pain . 
leave alone . 
leave alone because you know you do n't belong . 
you do n't belong here . 
and when i go , do n't you follow . 
leave alone . 
leave alone because you know you do n't belong . 
you do n't belong here . 
slip out quiet . 
nobody 's look . 
leave alone . 
you do n't belong here .
