# walk out in the rain so i just walk out in the rain so this the cloud can hide the pain and maybe you will never see the thousand tear you give to me . 
and , if the rain should go away , then in me lonely room i 'll stay so this the world will never know how much it hurt to see you go away . 
so i just live a life of hope , pretend this i can n't care , but , if you find you can cope , just call me name and i 'll be there . 
if i can live me life again , i still relive this precious time . 
though i know there will be pain , it feel so good while you be me . 
be me . 
be me . 
be me . 
be me . 
be me . 
so i just walk out in the rain , so i just walk out in the rain so this the cloud can hide the pain , so this the cloud can hide the pain and maybe you will never see and maybe you will never see the thousand tear you give to me , thousand tear you give . 
and , if the rain should go away , and if the rain should go away , then in me lonely room i stay , then in me lonely room i stay so this the world will never know how much it hurt to see you go . 
and , if you ever change you mind , you know , baby , you will find all me sorrow and me pain . 
you 'll find me walk in the rain .
