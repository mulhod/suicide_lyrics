#stupidity try get a foot in the door . 
god know what for ! 
and he 'll cut me down to size . 
stupidity try . 
everything here be free , everything but you and me . 
this paint never dry . 
stupidity try . 
savannah shoulder raise a cheer , color the sky with ash because they find some privateer to sail across the sea of trash . 
the enemy be within . 
do n't confuse me with he . 
the truth be otherwise . 
stupidity try . 
and so i go from floor to floor look for a port of call , another drink conquistador conquer the governor 's ball . 
i can n't think of a thing this i hope tomorrow bring . 
oh , what a surprise ! 
stupidity try .
