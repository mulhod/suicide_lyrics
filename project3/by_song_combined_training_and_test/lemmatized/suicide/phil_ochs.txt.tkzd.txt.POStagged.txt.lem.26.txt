#talking cuban crisis it be just a little while ago , i glue me ear to the radio . 
the announcer be say we 'd well beware . 
a crisis be hang , a wave up in the air , crawl on the grind , swim in the sea , head for me . 
well , i do n't know if i be for or against it . 
he be yell and scream a mile a minute . 
well , he say , "here come the president , but first this word from pepsodent . 
have white teeth , have clean breath when you 're face nuclear death" . 
and then president john begin to speak and i know right away he will n't be weak . 
well , he say he 'd see some missile base and terrible smile on cuban face , close picture , carry land reform too far , give land to the ussr . 
well , he say we must n't be afraid . 
we 're set up a little blockade . 
put we ship along the cuban shore and if the russian bear yell and roar , we 'll let he have it . 
from turkey and greece , formosa and spain , the peaceful west european plain , from alaska and greenland we 'll use we mean and twenty thousand submarine . 
we 're go to teach the russian a lesson for try to upset the balance of power . 
now more american stand behind the president and he military mind , but me , i stand behind a bar , dream of a spaceship getaway car . 
head for mar , any other planet this have bar , like gerde 's folk city . 
yes , it seem the stand be strong and plain , but some republican be go insane and they still be . 
well , they say we plan be just too mild . 
spare the rod and spoil the child . 
let 's sink cuba into the sea and give they back democracy under the water . 
well , the deadline be set for ten o'clock . 
for a cold war , it be a get hot . 
well , the russian try . 
the russian fail . 
homeward-bound this missile sail .
