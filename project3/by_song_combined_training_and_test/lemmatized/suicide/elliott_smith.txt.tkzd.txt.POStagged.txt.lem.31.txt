#in the lose and find ( honky bach ) he hold he breath to hold you hand , to walk the stairsteps in pair , climb up a slippery slope . 
i 'm in love , love i hope . 
do n't go home , angelina . 
stay with me , hang around in the lose and find . 
kiss you quick , feel weird , lonely , leer , and disappear . 
this be such a simple place pass time ca n't erase . 
do n't go home , angelina . 
paint tomorrow blue . 
day break and every morning , when he wake , he think of you . 
i 'm alone . 
this 's okay . 
i do n't mind . 
more of the time i do n't feel afraid to die . 
he be here pass by . 
do n't go home , angelina . 
stay with me , hang around in the lose and find . 
stay with me , hang around in the lose and find .
