# the big lie i 'm wait for the train , the subway this only go one way , the stupid thing this will come to pull we apart and make everybody late . 
you spend everything you have , want everything to stop this bad and now i 'm a crush credit card register to smith , not the name this you call me with . 
you turn white like a saint . 
i 'm tire of dance on a pot of gold-flake paint . 
oh , we 're so very precious , you and i , and everything this you do make me want to die . 
oh , i just tell the big lie . 
i just tell the big lie , the big lie .
