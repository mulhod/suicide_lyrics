#prison food you walk the earth , talk and never speak a word . 
he wonder who will be the first to go . 
i say you know , the big thing we get to face alone . 
do n't want to waste time and go . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
a trace of me , it float in me periphery and , every time i turn to see , it go . 
alone alone again lone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
float by like a satellite to pass the time , you 'll float by again and i can tell you about the little . 
thing so you do n't think about the big thing for a while . 
you walk the earth , talk and never speak a word . 
he wonder who will be the first to go . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again . 
alone alone again alone .
