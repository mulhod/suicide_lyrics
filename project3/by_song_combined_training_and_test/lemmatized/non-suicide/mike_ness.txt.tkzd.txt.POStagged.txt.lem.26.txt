#drug train it 'll take you as high as the heaven . 
it 'll take you to the depth of hell . 
it 'll make you friend , it 'll take you friend who will never live to tell . 
drug train , drug train . 
drug train , drug train . 
the traing . 
first stop be pleasure . 
the scond stop be fun . 
but in a jail cell , baby , in a hospital be , you 'll need hope , because you be not get none . 
drug train , drug train . 
drug train , drug train . 
the train pass through the graveyard . 
may the love one rest in peace . 
for the last stop baby be a violent crash and hard time they never cease . 
drug train , drug train . 
drug train , drug train .
