make light so now we see . 
come bury me burn remain . 
this puddle cloud . 
oh i , i understand now . 
but darkness fall like shatter piece , dangle , shimmer , tear and tattered and crown . 
oh , i 'll not be tell "no " to no more . 
you must believe to hear me sing this messy morsel of me self-assuring love . 
oh , it 's painful knead . 
yes , i lie and i wrangle with prospective angle this glare me down and face me with all i do wrong . 
why do they all look like me ? 
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh just to prove i 'm alive . 
and it 's alright because tonight there 's a way i 'll make light of me treacherous life . 
if i have hand , i 'd hold up high me lofty dream , me alibi 's real name . 
but i have no strength . 
so i toss and i turn and i spit in the urn . 
there 's a ghost in you eye . 
there be someone this know more than i . 
but i 'm quick to deny . 
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh just to prove i 'm alive . 
and it 's alright because tonight there 's a way i 'll make light of me treacherous life . 
make light !
