#eyes as candle me world be stir sickly . 
spit out we voice sing , "oh , no , no" . 
to kingdom come so slightly . 
here in the void in you place , i twitch and tweak an illusion to sit and stare so blankly until we hope be use up . 
why do i always seem to need you when you 're flee ? 
where do you go when i 'm around ? 
what have i do ? 
what have i lose this 's so defeat ? 
and have the nerve to wear a crown ? 
oh , hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
some unguarded room . 
a smoky figure fill me full , make me head swell and ruin . 
the family kneel at the pew . 
they nod . 
' we believe in what you 're do ' . 
i feel you rise above me , the western landscape 's tower , and from me shell of a body the flower blossom for pick . 
why do i always seem to need you when you 're flee ? 
where do you go when i 'm around ? 
what have i do ? 
what have i get this 's so defeat ? 
and have the nerve to wear a crown ? 
oh , hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
hey ! 
i 've wait and wait for someone to take it do n't fight it . 
do n't bother an inch for another . 
do n't listen . 
do n't hear they . 
they 're in this together . 
i 've learn well . 
now hear me . 
there 's much to be fear . 
i 'm use to you absence , you faceless distraction . 
i 've paint you pattern , but find they attractive . 
now i 've be lean toward a life far more candid , though lead through the dark with you eye as me candle , where you life and me life 's direction can wrangle and all of a sudden you 've leave me to handle the reason this never forbid me to stand tall and somehow , oh , somehow i find out the secret to stay alive without actually breathe .
