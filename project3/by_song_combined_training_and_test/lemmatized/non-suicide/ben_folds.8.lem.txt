#late under some dirty word on a dirty wall , eat takeout by me , i play the show , get back in the van and put the walkman on and you be play . 
in some other dive a thousand mile away , i play a thousand time before , and like pathetic star , the truck stop and the rock club wall i always know , you see they too , but you never will again . 
it 's too late . 
do n't you know it 's be too late for a long time . 
elliott , man , you play a fine guitar and some dirty basketball . 
the song you write get me through a lot . 
just want to tell you this . 
but it 's too late . 
it 's too late . 
no , do n't you know it 's be too late for a long time . 
oh no thing be look up , at less this 's what i hear . 
oh no someone come and wash away you hard-earned peace of mind when desperate static beat the silence up , a quiet truth to calm you down . 
the song you write get me through a lot . 
just want to tell you this . 
but it 's too late . 
it 's too late . 
no , do n't you know it 's be too late for a long time . 
it 's too late . 
it 's too late . 
no , do n't you know it 's be too late for a long time .
