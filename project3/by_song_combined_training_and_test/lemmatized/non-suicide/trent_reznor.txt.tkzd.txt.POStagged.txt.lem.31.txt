#dead soul someone take this dream away this point me to another day . 
a duel of personality this stretch all true reality . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
when figure from the past stand tall , and mock voice ring the hall . 
imperialistic house of prayer . 
conquistador who take they share . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
call me , call me , call me , call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me . 
they keep call me , keep on call me .
