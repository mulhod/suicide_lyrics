#99 to life i 'm break hearted , i 'm a break man . 
drive by anger , on this night i run . 
i have me a woman . 
i think this he 'd be true . 
now he 's go and leave me , you know he life be through . 
lonely weekend , baby lonely night . 
the judge he give me , ninety nine to life . 
i wish he can be here , lord if he only can . 
instead he 's lay in a puddle of blood . 
he be me baby , think he 'd be me wife . 
i kill me baby , i kill he with me knife . 
lonely weekend , baby lonely night . 
the judge he give me , ninety nine to life . 
so alone i 'm sit in me prison cell lord only know now , i 'm in a live hell . 
the rest of me life , in this penitentiary , the good lord above now , please have mercy on me . 
lonely weekend , baby lonely night . 
the judge he give me , ninety nine to life .
