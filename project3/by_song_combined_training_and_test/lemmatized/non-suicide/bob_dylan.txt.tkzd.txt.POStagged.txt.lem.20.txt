#most likely you go you way ( and i 'll go me ) you say you love me and you 're think of me , but you know you can be wrong . 
you say you tell me this you want to hold me , but you know you 're not this strong . 
i just ca n't do what i do before . 
i just ca n't beg you anymore . 
i 'm go to let you pass and i 'll go last . 
then time will tell just who have fall and who 's be leave behind when you go you way and i go me . 
you say you disturb me and you do n't deserve me , but you know sometime you lie . 
you say you 're shake and you 're always ache , but you know how hard you try . 
sometime it get so hard to care . 
it ca n't be this way everywhere . 
and i 'm go to let you pass . 
yes , and i 'll go last . 
then time will tell who have fall and who 's be leave behind when you go you way and i go me . 
well , the judge , he hold a grudge . 
he 's go to call on you . 
but he 's badly-built and he walk on stilt .

you say you 're sorry for tell story this you know i believe be true . 
you say you get some other kind of lover and , yes , i believe you do . 
you say me kiss be not like he , but this time i 'm not go to tell you why this be . 
i 'm just go to let you pass . 
yes , and i 'll go last . 
then time will tell who have fall and who 's be leave behind when you go you way and i go me .
