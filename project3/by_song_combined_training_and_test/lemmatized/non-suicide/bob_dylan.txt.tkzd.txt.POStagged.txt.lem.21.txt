#temporary like achilles stand on you window , honey , yes , i 've be here before . 
feel so harmless , i 'm look at you second door . 
how come you do n't send me no regard ? 
you know i want you love . 
honey , why be you so hard ? 
kneel beneath you ceiling , yes , i guess i 'll be here for a while . 
i 'm try to read you portrait , but i 'm helpless like a rich man 's child . 
how come you send someone out to have me bar ? 
you know i want you love . 
honey , why be you so hard ? 
like a poor fool in he prime , yes , i know you can hear me walk , but be you heart make out of stone or be it lime or be it just solid rock ? 
well , i lean into you hallway , lean against you velvet door . 
i watch upon you scorpion , who crawl across you circus floor . 
just what do you think you have to guard ? 
you know i want you love . 
honey , but you 're so hard . 
achilles be in you alleyway . 
he do n't want me here , he do brag . 
he 's point to the sky and he 's hungry like a man in drag . 
how come you get someone like he to be you guard ? 
you know i want you love . 
honey , but you 're so hard .
