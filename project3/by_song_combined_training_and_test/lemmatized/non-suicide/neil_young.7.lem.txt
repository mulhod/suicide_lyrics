#unknown legend he use to work in a diner . 
never see a woman look fine . 
i use to order just to watch he float across the floor . 
he grow up in a small town , never put he root down . 
daddy always keep move , so he do too . 
somewhere on a desert highway he ride a harley-davidson , he long blonde hair fly in the wind . 
he 's be run half he life , the chrome and steel he ride collide with the very air he breathe , the air he breathe . 
you know it ai n't easy . 
you get to hold on . 
he be an unknown legend in he time . 
now he 's dress two kid , look for a magic kiss . 
he get the far-away look in he eye . 
somewhere on a desert highway he ride a harley-davidson , he long blonde hair fly in the wind . 
he 's be run half he life , the chrome and steel he ride collide with the very air he breathe , the air he breathe .
