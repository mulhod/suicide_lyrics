# a place in me heart i see he today , oh god i miss he smile . 
a pleasant memory of thing in life worthwhile , the thing worthwhile . 
we use to walk , and we use to talk . 
we use to laugh , and we use to cry . 
and there will always be a place in me heart for he . 
i think of he today , of year together spend . 
a pleasant memory of place this we wend , the place we wend . 
we use to walk , and we use to talk . 
we use to laugh , and we use to cry . 
and there will always be a place in me heart for he .
