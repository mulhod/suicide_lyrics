# when angel sing at last we meet again , dear god , hear the angel sing . 
the funeral be nice when we know you 're there , when the angel sing . 
sometime i try so hard to understand the thing you do . 
i like to question you when it all come down , hear the angel sing . 
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angel sing . 
love and death do n't mean a thing till the angel sing . 
the prisoner pray when they 're on to death row , when the angel sing . 
the junky cry for love but it 's all run out , when the angel sing . 
the sin of the world . 
and it 's cold on the street and you 're all alone and the tear they start to fall when it all come down , hear the angel sing . 
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angel sing . 
love and death do n't mean a thing , till the angel sing . 
little by little , day by day , i watch the child play . 
cause life and death do n't mean a thing , till the angel sing . 
when the angel of death come to look for me , hear the angel sing . 
i hope i be everything i be suppose to be , when the angel sing . 
there 's get to be a heaven cause i 've already do me time in hell . 
and a little , baby 's bear , when it all come down , hear the angel sing . 
stand up strong , feel the pain , when the angel sing . 
love and death do n't mean a thing , till the angel sing . 
little by little , day by day , i watch the child play because life and death do n't mean a thing till the angel sing .
