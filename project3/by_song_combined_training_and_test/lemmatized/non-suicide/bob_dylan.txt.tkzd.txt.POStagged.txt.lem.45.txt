#it 's alright , ma ( i 'm only bleed ) darkness at the break of noon shadow even the silver spoon . 
the hand-made blade , the child 's balloon eclipse both the sun and moon . 
to understand , you know too soon there 's no sense in try .

so , do n't fear if you hear a foreign sound to you ear . 
it 's alright , ma , i 'm only sigh . 
as some warn victory , some downfall , private reason , great or small , can be see in the eye of this this call to make all this should be kill to crawl while others say , "do n't hate nothing at all except hatred . 
" disillusion word like bullet bark as human god aim for they mark , make everything from toy gun this spark to flesh-colored christ this glow in the dark . 
it 's easy to see without look too far this not much be really sacred . 
while preacher preach of evil fate , teacher teach this knowledge wait , can lead to hundred-dollar plate , goodness hide behind it gate , but even the president of the unite state sometime must have to stand naked .

a question in you nerve be light , yet you know there be no answer fit to satisfy , ensure you not to quit , to keep it in you mind and not forget this it be not he or he or they or it this you belong to . 
but , though the master make the rule for the wise man and the fool , i get nothing , ma , to live up to . 
for they this must obey authority this they do not respect in any degree , who despise they job , they destiny , speak jealously of they this be free , do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in . 
while some on principle baptize to strict party-platform tie , social club in drag disguise , outsider they can freely criticize , tell nothing except who to idolize and say , "god bless he . 
" while one who sing with he tongue on fire gargle in the rat-race choir , bend out of shape from society 's plier , care not to come up any high , but rather get you down in the hole this he 's in . 
but i mean no harm nor put fault on anyone this life in a vault , but it 's alright , ma , if i ca n't please he .
