#sullen girl day like this i do n't know what to do with me all day and all night . 
i wander the hall along the wall and under me breath i say to me i need fuel to take flight . 
and there 's too much go on , but it 's calm under the wave in the blue of me oblivion , under the wave in the blue of me oblivion . 
be this why they call me a sullen girl , sullen girl . 
they do n't know i use to sail the deep and tranquil sea . 
but he wash me ashore , and he take me pearl and leave an empty shell of me . 
and there 's too much go on , but it 's calm under the wave in the blue of me oblivion , under the wave in the blue of me oblivion , under the wave in the blue of me oblivion . 
it 's calm under the wave , in the blue of me oblivion .
