#new morning ca n't you hear this rooster crow ? 
rabbit run down across the road , underneath the bridge where the water flow through . 
so happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you . 
ca n't you hear this motor turn ? 
automobile come into style , come down the road for a country mile or two . 
so happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you . 
the night pass away so quickly . 
it always do when you 're with me . 
ca n't you feel this sun shine ? 
groundhog run by the country stream . 
this must be the day this all of me dream come true . 
so happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you . 
so happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue on this new morning , new morning , on this new morning with you . 
new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning , new morning .
