#blessed bless be the meek for they shall inherit . 
bless be the lamb who blood flow . 
bless be the sit upon , spit upon , rat on . 
o lord , why have you forsake me ? 
i get no place to go . 
i 've walk around soho for the last night or so , ah , but it do n't matter , no . 
bless be the land and the kingdom . 
bless be the man who soul belong to . 
bless be the meth drinker , pot seller , illusion dweller . 
o lord , why have you forsake me ? 
me word trickle down , from a wind this i have no intention to heal . 
bless be the stain glass , window pane glass . 
bless be the church service , make me nervous . 
bless be the penny rookers , cheap hooker , groovy looker . 
o lord , why have you forsake me ? 
i have tend me own garden much too long .
