#i be n't bear to follow when i grow up , go to be a star . 
go to sing me song and play me guitar , i 'm ready . 
go to change the world , go to turn the page , go to say what i feel , let out this rage , get ready . 
we 're go down , down to the street below . 
go to sing the song of the street again . 
go to knock me off me foot , so get ready . 
i 'll sing a song for the fall angel . 
this one go to all the unsung hero . 
we 're go down , down to the street below , cause do n't you know , i be n't bear to follow . 
i realize this in you eye you get idea but i get me , get ready . 
here come the new generation . 
hope they feel and fight the same way as we do . 
we 're go down , down to the street below , cause i be n't bear , i be n't bear to follow , no . 
when i grow up , go to be a star . 
go to sing me song and play me guitar , i 'm ready . 
go to change the world , go to turn the page , go to say what i feel , let out this rage , get ready . 
we 're go down , down to the street below , cause do n't you know , i be n't bear to follow . 
we 're go down , down to the street below , cause do n't you know , i be n't bear to follow . 
we 're go down , down , down , down . 
we 're go down , down , down , down . 
i say goodbye to the masse . 
i be n't bear to follow .
