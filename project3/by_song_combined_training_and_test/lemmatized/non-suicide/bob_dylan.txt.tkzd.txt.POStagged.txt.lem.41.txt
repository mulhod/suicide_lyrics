#on the road again well , i wake up in the morning , there 's frog inside me sock . 
you mama , he 's hide inside the icebox . 
you daddy walk in wear a napoleon bonaparte mask . 
and you ask why i do n't live here . 
honey , do you have to ask ? 
well , i go to pet you monkey , i get a face full of claw . 
i say , "who 's in the fireplace ? 
" and you tell me , " santa claus . 
" the milkman come in , he 's wear a derby hat . 
and you ask why i do n't live here . 
honey , how come you have to ask me this ? 
well , i ask for something to eat , i 'm hungry as a hog , so i get brown rice , seaweed , and a dirty hot dog . 
i 've get a hole where me stomach disappear . 
then you ask why i do n't live here . 
honey , i get to think you 're really weird . 
you grandpa 's cane , it turn into a sword . 
you grandma pray to picture this be paste on a board . 
everything inside me pocket you uncle steal . 
and you ask why i do n't live here . 
honey , i ca n't believe this you 're for real . 
well , there 's fistfight in the kitchen . 
they 're enough to make me cry . 
then the mailman come in . 
even he 's get to take a side , even the butler , he 's get something to prove . 
and you ask why i do n't live here . 
honey , how come you do n't move ?
