#dear lover yeah , love over and over again now . 
it be not nothing girl till you 've feel the pain . 
up against the wall . 
why do love always have to hurt ? 
you scratch run across me back and then a tear . 
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more . 
dear lover , i pick me heart up from the floor . 
dear lover , i ca n't believe it 's come to this . 
dear lover , give me one last painful kiss . 
there be not nothing in this world for free now . 
so how high of a price will you pay ? 
hear the scream so loud , wake up to the break glass . 
it 's a scene from bad to worse and many more tear . 
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more . 
dear lover , i pick me heart up from the floor . 
dear lover , i ca n't believe it 's come to this . 
dear lover , give me one last painful kiss . 
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more . 
dear lover , i pick me heart up from the floor .

one last kiss , one last kiss , one last kiss .
