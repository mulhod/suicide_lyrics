#time pass slowly time pass slowly up here in the mountain . 
we set beside bridge and walk beside fountain , catch the wild fish this float through the stream . 
time pass slowly when you 're lose in a dream . 
once i have a sweetheart . 
he be fine and good look . 
we sit in he kitchen while he mama be cook , stare out the window to the star high above . 
time pass slow when you 're search for love . 
aing . 
no reason to go in a wagon to town . 
aing . 
no reason to go to the fair . 
aing . 
no reason to go up . 
be not no reason to go down . 
aing . 
no reason to go anywhere . 
time pass slowly up here in the daylight , stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right . 
like the red rise of summer this bloom in the day time pass slowly and fade away .
