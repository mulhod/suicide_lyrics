#nobody tell me everybody 's talk , and no one say a word . 
everybody 's make love , and no one really care . 
there 's nazi in the bathroom just below the stair . 
always something happen and nothing go on . 
there 's always something cook and nothing in the pot . 
they 're starve back in china , so finish what you get . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
strange day indeed , strange day indeed . 
everybody 's run , and no one make a move . 
everyone 's a winner , and nothing leave to lose . 
there 's a little yellow idol to the north of kathmandu . 
everybody 's fly , and no one leave the grind . 
everybody 's cry , and no one make a sound . 
there 's a place for we in the movie you just get to lie around . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
strange day indeed , more peculiar , mama . 
everybody 's smoke , and no one 's get high . 
everybody 's fly , and never touch the sky . 
there 's a ufo over new york , and i ai n't too surprise . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
nobody tell me there 'd be day like this . 
strange day indeed , more peculiar , mama .
