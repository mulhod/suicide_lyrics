#happiness in slavery slave scream , he think he know what he want . 
slave scream , think he have something to say . 
slave scream , he hear but do n't want to listen . 
slave scream , he 's be beat into submission . 
do n't open you eye , you wo n't like what you see . 
the devil of truth steal the soul of the free . 
do n't open you eye , take it from me . 
i have find , you can find , happiness be slavery . 
slave scream , he spend he life learn conformity . 
slave scream , he claim he have he own identity . 
slave scream , he 's go to cause the system to fall . 
slave scream but he 's glad to be chain to this wall . 
do n't open you eye , you wo n't like what you see . 
the blind have be bless with security . 
do n't open you eye , take it from me . 
i have find , you can find , happiness be slavery . 
i do n't know what i be . 
i do n't know where i 've be . 
human junk , just word and so much skin . 
stick me hand through the cage of this endless routine . 
just some flesh catch in this big , break machine .
