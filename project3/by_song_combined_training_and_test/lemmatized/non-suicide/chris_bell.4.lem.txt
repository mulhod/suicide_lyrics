#get away i know what it be you 're think , but baby , it 's sacred to me . 
whenever i feel like i 'm sink , you make a beautiful scene . 
you do n't lie to me , and i will n't lie to you , oh , no . 
baby , i 'm feel low . 
do n't know what i 'm go to do . 
do n't know what you 're put me through . 
once in a while you 're lonely . 
if you feel lonely , cry . 
i 'd love to know what be the matter , unless you 're with some other guy , because you do n't lie to me and i will n't lie to you , oh , no . 
baby , i 'm feel low . 
do n't know what i 'm go to do . 
you do n't know what you 're put me through . 
do you want to ? 
i want you . 
do you want to ? 
i want you too . 
do n't you know i 'm lose sleep at night , sleep at night ? 
do n't know what i 'm go to do . 
do n't know what you 're put me through . 
i know what it be you 're think , but baby , it 's strange to me . 
whenever i feel like i 'm sink , you make a beautiful scene . 
do n't lie to me , and i will n't lie to you , oh , no . 
and , baby , i 'm feel low . 
do n't know what i 'm go to do . 
do n't know what you 're put me through .
