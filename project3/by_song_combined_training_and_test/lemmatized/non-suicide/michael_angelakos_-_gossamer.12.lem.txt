# where we belong it 's gotten cold in here , but a solemn warmth draw near and with a gentle touch all this burden and such fear be wipe clearly . 
who say you ought to stay ? 
how 's this the easy way ? 
it 's far from give up . 
coward never say enough be enough . 
and then i 'm lift up out of the crimson tub the bath begin to drain and from the floor he pray away all me pain . 
who say this god exist ? 
we ca n't see icon or myth , but , well , i believe in you . 
do you believe in me , too , gabriel ? 
all the thing you ca n't control should never destroy the love one hold . 
i find a place , i find a place , i find a place where we belong . 
never be up and down , be in between the white cloud . 
never do i ever think i 'd find all the thing i 've find because how you keep on live when you 're always but a million down . 
all i 've ever want be to be happy and make you proud .
