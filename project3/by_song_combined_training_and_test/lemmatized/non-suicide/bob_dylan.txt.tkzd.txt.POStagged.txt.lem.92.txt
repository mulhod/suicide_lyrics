#going , go , go i 've just reach a place where the willow do n't bend . 
there 's not much more to be say . 
it 's the top of the end . 
i 'm go . 
i 'm go . 
i 'm go . 
i 'm close the book on the page and the text and i do n't really care , ooh , what happen next . 
i 'm just go . 
i 'm go . 
i 'm go . 
i be hang on the thread . 
i be play it straight . 
now i 've just get to cut loose before it get late . 
so i 'm go . 
i 'm go . 
i 'm go . 
grandma say , "boy , go and follow you heart and you 'll be fine at the end of the line . 
all this 's gold do n't shine . 
do n't you and you one true love ever part . 
" i be walk the road . 
i 've be live on the edge . 
now i 've just get to go before i get to the ledge . 
so i 'm go . 
i 'm just go . 
i 'm go .
