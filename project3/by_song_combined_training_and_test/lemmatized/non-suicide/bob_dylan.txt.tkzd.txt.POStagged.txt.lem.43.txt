tambourine man , play a song for me . 
i 'm not sleepy and there be no place i 'm go to . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come follow you . 
though i know this even 's empire have return into sand , vanish from me hand , leave me blindly here to stand , but still not sleep , me weariness amaze me , i 'm brand on me foot , i have no one to meet , and the ancient , empty street 's too dead for dream . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
i 'm not sleepy and there be no place i 'm go to . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come follow you . 
take me on a trip upon you magic , swirl ship . 
me sense have be strip . 
me hand ca n't feel to grip . 
me toe , too numb to step , wait only for me boot-heels to be wander . 
i 'm ready to go anywhere . 
i 'm ready for to fade into me own parade . 
cast you dance spell me way , i promise to go under it . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
i 'm not sleepy and there be no place i 'm go to . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come follow you . 
though you may hear laugh , spin , swing madly across the sun , it 's not aim at anyone , it 's just escape on the run , and but for the sky there be no fence face . 
and , if you hear vague trace of skip reel of rhyme to you tambourine in time , it 's just a rag clown behind . 
i will n't pay it any mind . 
it 's just a shadow you 're see this he 's chase . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
i 'm not sleepy and there be no place i 'm go to . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come follow you . 
and take me disappear through the smoke-rings of me mind , down the foggy ruin of time , far past the freeze leave , the haunt , frighten tree , out to the windy beach , far from the twist reach of crazy sorrow . 
yes , to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand wave free , silhouette by the sea , circle by the circus sand , with all memory and fate drive deep beneath the wave , let me forget about today until tomorrow . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
i 'm not sleepy and there be no place i 'm go to . 
hey , mr . 
tambourine man , play a song for me . 
in the jingle-jangle morning i 'll come follow you .
