#writing on the wall there be a time when you be proud . 
you look up to me with big eye , and i can do no wrong . 
there 's something inside , this 's clearly tear both of we apart , ooh ooh there 's something inside . 
i wonder where you be tonight , and what you do with you day . 
ca n't find the word to say . 
do you feel the sun ? 
do you feel the warmness of me heart ? 
ooh ooh do you feel at all ? 
they say if you love someone , you get to let they go . 
and if they return to you , this 's surely how you 'll know . 
ooh ooh , i can read the write on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go . 
they say if you love someone , you get to let they go . 
and if they return to you , this 's surely how you 'll know . 
ooh ooh , i can read the write on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go . 
i 'm hopelessly aware of the good and bad trait we share . 
it 's like look at me . 
and i know this at time i can 've handle thing differently , ooh ooh , but know me intention be well . 
they say if you love someone , you get to let they go . 
and if they return to you , this 's surely how you 'll know . 
ooh ooh , i can read the write on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go . 
ooh , i ca n't let go . 
ooh , i ca n't let go . 
ooh , i ca n't let go . 
ooh , i ca n't let go .
