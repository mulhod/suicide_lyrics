#ball and chain well it 's be ten year and a thousand tear , and look at the mess i 'm in . 
a break nose and a break heart , an empty bottle of gin . 
well i sit and i pray in me break down chevrolet . 
while i 'm sing to me , there 's get to be another way . 
take away , take away , take away this ball and chain . 
well i 'm lonely and i 'm tire , and i ca n't take any more pain . 
take away , take away , never to return again . 
take away , take away , take away , take away this ball and chain . 
well i 've search and i 've search to find the perfect life . 
a brand new car and a brand new suit , i even get me a little wife . 
but wherever i have go i be sure to find me there . 
you can run all you life , but not go anywhere . 
take away , take away , take away this ball and chain . 
well i 'm lonely and i 'm tire , and i ca n't take any more pain . 
take away , take away , never to return again . 
take away , take away , take away , take away this ball and chain . 
well i 'll pass the bar on the way to me dingy hotel room . 
i spend all me money , i 've be drink since half past noon . 
well i 'll wake there in the morning , or maybe in the county jail . 
time be hard , get hard , i 'm bear to lose and destine to fail . 
take away , take away , take away this ball and chain . 
well i 'm lonely and i 'm tire , and i ca n't take any more pain . 
take away , take away , never to return again . 
take away , take away , take away , take away this ball and chain .
