#get go how many time do i have to say to get away , get go . 
flip you shit past another lasses ' humble dwell . 
you get you game , make you shoot , and you get away with a lot , but i 'm not turn on . 
so put away this meat you 're sell . 
because i do know what 's good for me , and i 've do what i can for you , but you 're not benefit , and yet i 'm sit sing again , sing , sing , again .

nothing to figure out . 
i get to get he out . 
it 's time the truth be out this he do n't give a shit about me .
