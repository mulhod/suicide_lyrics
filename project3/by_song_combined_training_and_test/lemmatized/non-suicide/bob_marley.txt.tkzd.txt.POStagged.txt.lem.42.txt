#time will tell jah will never give the power to a baldhead . 
run come crucify the dread . 
time alone , oh , time will tell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
time alone , oh , time will tell . 
you think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
back they up ; oh , not the brother , but the one who set they up . 
time alone , oh , time will tell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
time alone , oh , time will tell . 
you think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
oh , me , oh , me , oh , me child be cry . 
oh , child , weep no more ! 
oh , me sycamore tree , see the freedom tree . 
all you have speak . 
oh , child , weep no more . 
weep no more child . 
weep no more ! 
jah will never give the power to a baldhead . 
run come crucify the dread . 
time alone , oh , time will tell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell . 
time alone , oh , time will tell . 
think you 're in heaven , but you live in hell .
