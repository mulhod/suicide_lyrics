# a mistake i 'm go to make a mistake . 
i 'm go to do it on purpose . 
i 'm go to waste me time . 
because i 'm full as a tick , and i 'm scratch at the surface . 
and what i find be me . 
and when the day be do , and i look back , and the fact be i have fun , fumble around . 
all the advice i shun , and i run where they tell me not to run , but i sure have fun , so i 'm go to fuck it up again . 
i 'm go to do another detour . 
unpave me path . 
and if you want to make sense , what you look at me for ? 
i 'm no good at math . 
and when i find me way back , the fact be i just may stay , or i may not . 
i 've acquire quite a taste for a well-made mistake . 
i want to make mistake ; why ca n't i make a mistake ? 
i 'm always do what i think i should . 
almost always do everybody good . 
why ? 
do i want to do right ? 
of course , but do i really want to feel i 'm force to answer you ? 
hell no .
