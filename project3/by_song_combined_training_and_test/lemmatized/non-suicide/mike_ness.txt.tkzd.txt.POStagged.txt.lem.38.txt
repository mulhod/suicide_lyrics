#down on the world again this be not the way it 's suppose to be , there 's a dark cloud follow me . 
i 'm disillusion and i 'm down on the world again . 
there 's movie go on in me head and all i can see be the color red . 
i 'm relentless and i 'm down on the world again . 
give me tomorrow 's break dream now . 
i 'm feel like a load gun . 
there 's a world of guilt write on me face , and i feel ashamed for the human race . 
i 've be forsake , and i 'm down on the world again . 
well , i feel so alone in this crowd . 
me thought of despair be get loud . 
i 'm disrespect and i 'm down on the world again . 
love and tolerance have abandon me , and i feel the gloom hover over me . 
i 'm resentful , and i 'm down on the world again . 
give me tomorrow 's break dream now . 
i 'm feel like a load gun . 
give me tomorrow 's holy scheme now , so hopeless when there 's no place leave to run . 
well , i try to play for the high stake . 
you wo n't let me forget me mistake . 
i 'm unforgiven , and i 'm down on the world again . 
this be not the way it 's suppose to be . 
there 's a dark cloud follow me . 
i 'm distort , and i 'm down on the world again .
