#in this twilight watch the sun , as it crawl across a final time . 
and it feel like , like it be a friend . 
it be watch we , and the world we set on fire . 
do you wonder if it feel the same ? 
and the sky be fill with light . 
can you see it ? 
all the black be really white , if you believe it . 
as you time be run out , let me take away you doubt . 
you can find a well a place in this twilight . 
from dust to dust , ash in you hair remind me what it feel like and i wo n't feel again . 
night descend . 
can i have be a well person ? 
if i can only do it all again . 
and the sky be fill with light . 
do you see it ? 
all the black be really white , if you believe it . 
and the long this you feel . 
you know none of this be real . 
you will find a well a place in this twilight .
