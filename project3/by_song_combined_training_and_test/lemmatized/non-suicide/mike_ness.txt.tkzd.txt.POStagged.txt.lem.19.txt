#let it be me i 've be in love , but now i 'm wait . 
do n't ever want to worry about a thing . 
i sit at home and i wonder : will i rise or will i go under . 
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely . 
let it be me , let it be me , you one and only . 
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you . 
let it be me , if you feel blue . 
i 've see you aroud , but you do n't know me . 
i 've watch you life , but ca n't always see . 
i 'll try and i 'll try girl to love you . 
and when we die , you will have love too . 
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely . 
let it be me , let it be me , you one and only . 
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you . 
let it be me , if you feel blue . 
you know you friend talk bad about me . 
you folk say it 's not suppose to be . 
you know girl you life be go by fast , try to make it last . 
let it be me , let it be me , if you 're lonely . 
let it be me , let it be me , you one and only . 
let it be me , let it be me , to satify you . 
let it be me , if you feel blue .
