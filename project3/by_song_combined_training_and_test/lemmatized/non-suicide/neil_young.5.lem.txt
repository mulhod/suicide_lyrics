#comes a time come a time when you 're drift , come a time when you settle down . 
come a light , feeling lift . 
lift this baby right up off the grind . 
oh , this old world keep spin around . 
it 's a wonder tall tree ai n't lay down . 
there come a time . 
you and i , we be capture . 
we take we soul and we fly away . 
we be right , we be give . 
this 's how we keep what we give away . 
oh , this old world keep spin around . 
it 's a wonder tall tree ai n't lay down . 
there come a time .
