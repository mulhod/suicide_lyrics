# i 'll be you baby tonight close you eye . 
close the door . 
you do n't have to worry anymore . 
i 'll be you baby tonight . 
shut the light . 
shut the shade . 
you do n't have to be afraid . 
i 'll be you baby tonight . 
well , this mockingbird 's go to sail away . 
we 're go to forget it . 
this big , fat moon be go to shine like a spoon , but we 're go to let it . 
you wo n't regret it . 
kick you shoe off . 
do not fear . 
bring this bottle over here . 
i 'll be you baby tonight .
