#gates of eden of war and peace the truth just twist . 
it curfew-gull , it glide upon four-legged forest-clouds . 
the cowboy angel ride with he candle light into the sun though it glow be wax in black , all except when beneath the tree of eden . 
the lamppost stand with fold arm , it iron claw attach to curb beneath hole where baby wail though it shadow 's metal badge all and all can only fall with a crash , but meaningless blow . 
no sound ever come from the gate of eden . 
the savage soldier stick he head in sand and then complain unto the shoeless hunter who 's go deaf , but still remain upon the beach , where hound dog bay at ship with tattoo sail , head for the gate of eden . 
with a time-rusted compass blade , aladdin and he lamp sit with utopian hermit-monks side-saddle on the golden calf and on they promise of paradise you will not hear a laugh , all except inside the gate of eden . 
relationship of ownership , they whisper in the wing to this condemn to act accordingly and wait for succeed king and i try to harmonize with song the lonesome sparrow sing . 
there be no king inside the gate of eden . 
the motorcycle black madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and he silver-studded phantom cause the gray-flannel dwarf to scream as he weep to wicked bird of prey , who pick up on he breadcrumb sin and there be no sin inside the gate of eden . 
the kingdom of experience , in the precious wind they rot while pauper change possession , each one wish for what the other have get .
