#let you love grow tall in pasture blue and green i 'll follow you and you 'll follow me , me fabric 's mystery . 
i 'll wave you loyalty in the freeze breeze so desperately . 
and another one come down . 
and another one come down . 
and another one come down . 
i think i see me life . 
he bow all slyly and gentle-like . 
he 's never have the right . 
i 've never live without he sad and jealous eye . 
and another one come down . 
and another one come down . 
and another one come down . 
they 'd say , "let you love grow tall , let you love grow tall" . 
tall as the grass in the meadow ? 
or the dune on the shear ? 
like the building in the city ? 
and you child on the floor ? 
like the darkness in the forest ? 
like me frighten worry eye ? 
or the root in the soil ? 
be sky tell lie ? 
but it 's the think this count . 
quiet mind do n't know they worth . 
they know what to do , so i 'll pray for they and i 'll pray for you till me face turn blue . 
and another one come down . 
and another one come down . 
and another one come down . 
they 'd say , "let you love grow tall , let you love grow tall" . 
tall as the grass in the meadow ? 
or the dune on the shear ? 
like the building in the city ? 
and you child on the floor ? 
like the darkness in the forest ? 
like me frighten worry eye ? 
or the root in the soil ? 
be sky tell lie ?
