#going down on love get to get down , down on me knee . 
get to get down , down on me knee . 
go down on love . 
go down on love . 
go down , go down , go down . 
when the real thing go wrong and you ca n't get it on and you love , he have go and you get to carry on and you shoot out the light , ai n't come home for the night , you know you get to , get to , get to pay the price . 
somebody please , please help me . 
you know i 'm drown in the sea of hatred . 
get to get down , down on me knee . 
get to get down , down on me knee . 
go down on love . 
go down on love . 
go down , go down , go down . 
something precious and rare disappear in thin air and it seem so unfair . 
nothing do nowhere . 
well , you burn all you boat and you sow you wild oat . 
well , you know , you know , you know the price be right !
