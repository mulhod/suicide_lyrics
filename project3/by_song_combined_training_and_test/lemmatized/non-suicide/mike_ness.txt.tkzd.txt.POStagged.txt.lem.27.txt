#cold feeling uninvited feeling , they come without warn and they stay too long . 
i do n't want to feel , and if i run they 'll be just as strong . 
i 've be a-waiting , i 'm wait for some kind of sign . 
i try to separate , try to separate me body from me mind . 
i watch the clock as the second hand slowly go stroll by . 
i do n't want to feel , when a love one 's time 's come to die . 
i 've be a-waiting , i 'm wait for some kind of a sign . 
i try to separate , try to separate me body from me mind . 
cold feeling in the night . 
you know , this feel just be not right . 
and though i try i just ca n't hide . 
cold feeling in the night . 
look out ! 
yeah i get faith , but sometime fear it just weigh too much . 
i do n't want to feel , cold wind blow through me like an empty touch . 
i 've be a-waiting , i 'm wait for some kind of sign . 
i try to separate , try to separate me body from me mind . 
cold feeling in the night . 
you know , this feel just be not right . 
and though i try i just ca n't hide . 
cold feeling in the night . 
cold feeling in the night . 
cold feeling in the night . 
cold feeling in the night .
