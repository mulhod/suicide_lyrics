#something there be about you something there be about you this strike a match in me . 
be it the way you body move or be it the way you hair blow free ? 
or be it because you remind me of something this use to be , something this 's cross over from another century ? 
think i 'd shake the wonder and the phantom of me youth , rainy day on the great lake , walk the hill of old duluth . 
there be me and danny lopez , cold eye , black night , and then there be ruth . 
something there be about you this bring back a long-forgotten truth . 
suddenly i find you and the spirit in me sing . 
do n't have to look no further . 
you 're the soul of many thing . 
i can say this i 'd be faithful . 
i can say it in one sweet , easy breath , but to you this will be cruelty and to me it surely will be death . 
something there be about you this move with style and grace . 
i be in a whirlwind . 
now i 'm in some well place . 
me hand 's on the saber and you 've pick up on the baton . 
something there be about you this i ca n't quite put me finger on .
