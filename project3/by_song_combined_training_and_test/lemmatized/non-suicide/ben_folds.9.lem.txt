#sentimental guy there 's a moment in me mind i scribble and erase a thousand time like a letter never write or send . 
this conversation with the dead . 
i use to be a sentimental guy . 
now i 'm haunt by the leave unsay . 
i never think so much can change . 
little thing you say or do be part of me , come out from time to time . 
probably no one i know now will notice . 
but i never think so much can change . 
you drift far away , far away it seem . 
time have stop , the clock keep go . 
people talk and i 'm watch as flash of they face go black and white and fade to yellow in a box in an attic . 
but i never think so much can change . 
now i do n't miss anyone . 
i do n't miss anything . 
what a shame because i use to be a sentimental guy .
