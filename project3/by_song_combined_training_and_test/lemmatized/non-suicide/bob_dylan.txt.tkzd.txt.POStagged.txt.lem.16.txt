#i want you the guilty undertaker sigh . 
the lonesome organ-grinder cry . 
the silver saxophone say i should refuse you . 
the crack bell and washed-out horn blow into me face with scorn , but it 's not this way , i be n't bear to lose you . 
i want you . 
i want you . 
i want you so bad . 
honey , i want you . 
the drunken politician leap upon the street where mother weep and the savior , who be fast asleep , they wait for you and i wait for they to interrupt me drink from me break cup and ask me to open up the gate for you . 
i want you . 
i want you . 
yes , i want you so bad . 
honey , i want you . 
now , all me father , they 've go down . 
true love , they 've be without it . 
but all they daughter put me down because i do n't think about it . 
well , i return to the queen of spade and talk with me chambermaid . 
he know this he 's not afraid to look at he . 
he be good to me and there 's nothing he do n't see . 
he know where i 'd like to be , but it do n't matter . 
i want you . 
i want you . 
yes , i want you so bad . 
honey , i want you . 
now , you dance child with he chinese suit , he speak to me . 
i take he flute . 
no , i be n't very cute to he , be i ? 
but i do it because he lied , because he take you for a ride , and because time be on he side and because i want you . 
i want you . 
yes , i want you so bad . 
honey , i want you .
