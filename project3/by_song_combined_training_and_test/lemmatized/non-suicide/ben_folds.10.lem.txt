#time think of me any way you want . 
i can be the problem if this 's easy . 
in you head , move the piece around , thing i 've say . 
turn the memory upside down and it make it well , i know , but sometime it 's hard to swallow . 
in time , i will fade away . 
in time , i wo n't hear what you 're say . 
in time , but time take time , you know . 
tell you friend the thing they want to hear and see . 
start the drum . 
band against the enemy and in time i will fade away . 
in time , i wo n't care what you 're say . 
in time , but time take time , you know . 
in you head , move the piece around , thing i 've say . 
turn the memory upside down . 
it may make it well , i know , but sometime it 's hard to swallow . 
in time , i will fade away . 
in time , i wo n't care what you 're say . 
in time , but time take time , you know . 
time take time you know .
