#chimes of freedom far between sundown 's finish and midnight 's break toll , we duck inside the doorway as thunder wend crash , as majestic bell of bolt strike shadow in the sound , seem to be the chime of freedom flash , flash for the warrior who strength be not to fight , flash for the refugee on the unarm road of flight and for each and every underdog soldier in the night and we gaze upon the chime of freedom flash . 
through the city 's melt furnace , unexpectedly we watch with face hide as the wall be tighten , as the echo of the wed bell , before the blow rain , dissolve into the bell of the lightning , toll for the rebel , toll for the rake , toll for the luckless , the abandon , and forsaked , toll for the outcast burn constantly at stake and we gaze upon the chime of freedom flash . 
through the mad , mystic hammer of the wild , rip hail , the sky crack it poem in naked wonder this the cling of the church bell blow far into the breeze , leave only bell of lightning and it thunder , strike for the gentle , strike for the kind , strike for the guardian and protector of the mind and the poet and the painter far behind he rightful time and we gaze upon the chime of freedom flash . 
in the wild , cathedral even the rain unravel tale for the disrobe , faceless form of no position , toll for the tongue with no place to bring they thought all down in taken-for-granted situation , toll for the deaf and blind , toll for the mute , for the mistreat , mateless mother , the mistitled prostitute , for the misdemeanor outlaw , chain and cheat by pursuit and we gaze upon the chime of freedom flash . 
even though a cloud 's white curtain in a far-off corner flare and the hypnotic , splatter mist be slowly lift , electric light still strike like arrow , fire but for the one condemn to drift or else be keep from drift , toll for the search one on they speechless , seek trail , for the lonesome-hearted lover with too personal a tale and for each unharmful , gentle soul misplace inside a jail and we gaze upon the chime of freedom flash . 
starry-eyed and laugh , as i recall when we be catch , trap by no track of hour for they hang suspend as we listen one last time and we watch with one last look , spellbind and swallow till the toll end , toll for the ache , who wound can be nurse , for the countless , confuse , accuse , misuse , strung-out one and worse and for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe and we gaze upon the chime of freedom flash .
