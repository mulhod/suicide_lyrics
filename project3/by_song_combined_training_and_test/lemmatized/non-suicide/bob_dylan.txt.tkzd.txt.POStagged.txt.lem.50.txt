#from a buick 6th i get this graveyard woman , you know , he keep me kid . 
but me soulful mama , you know , he keep me hide . 
he 's a junkyard angel and he always give me bread . 
well , if i fall down dying , you know , he bind to put a blanket on me be . 
well , when the pipeline get break and i 'm lose on the river bridge , i 'm all crack up on the highway and in the water 's edge , again he come down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread . 
well , if i fall down dying , you know , he bind to put a blanket on me be . 
well , he do n't make me nervous . 
he do n't talk too much . 
he walk like bo diddley and he do n't need no crutch . 
he keep this .410 all load with lead . 
well , if i fall down dying , you know , he bind to put a blanket on me be .

well , you know , i need a steam-shovel , mama , to keep away the dead . 
i need a dump-truck , baby , to unload me head . 
he bring me everything and more and just like i say , well , if i fall down dying , you know , he bind to put a blanket on me be .
