#story of me life high school seem like such a blur . 
i do n't have much interest in sport or school election , and in class , i dream all day , of a rock 'n' roll weekend . 
and the girl in the front of the room , so close yet so far you know he never seem to notice this this silly schoolboy crush be n't just pretend . 
life go by so fast . 
you only want to do what you think be right . 
close you eye and then it 's past . 
story of me life . 
and i wend down me old neighborhood . 
the face have all change ; there 's no one leave to talk to , and the pool hall i love as a kid be now a seven eleven . 
i wend downtown to look for a job . 
i have no train , no experience to speak of . 
and i look at the hole in me jean , and turn and head back . 
life go by so fast . 
you only want to do what you think be right . 
close you eye and then it 's past . 
story of me life . 
good time come , and good time go . 
i only wish the good time will last a little long . 
and i think about the good time we have and why they have to end . 
so i sit at the edge of me be . 
i strum me guitar and i sing an outlaw love song . 
think 'bout what you 're do now , and when you 're come back . 
life go by so fast . 
you only want to do what you think be right . 
close you eye and then it 's past . 
story of me life .
