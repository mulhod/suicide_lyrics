# the downward spiral he can n't believe how easy it be . 
he put the gun into he face . 
bang ! 
so much blood from such a tiny little hole . 
problem do have solution , you know . 
a lifetime of fuck thing up fix in one determine flash . 
everything 's blue . 
everything 's blue in this world . 
the deep shade of mushroom blue . 
all fuzzy , spill out of me head .
