#billy 1st there 's gun across the river aim at you , lawman on you trail , he 'd like to catch you , bounty hunter too , they 'd like to get you . 
billy , they do n't like you to be so free . 
camp out all night on the veranda , deal card till dawn in the hacienda , up to boot hill they 'd like to send you . 
billy , do n't you turn you back on me . 
play around with some sweet seï¿½orita , into he dark hall where he will lead you , to the shadow of the mesa he will greet you . 
billy , you 're so far away from home .
