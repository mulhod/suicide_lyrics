#billy 7th spend the night with some sweet seï¿½orita , into he dark hall where he will lead you , in some lonesome shadow he may greet you . 
billy , you 're so doggone far away from home . 
they say this pat garrett 's get you number . 
sleep with one eye open when you slumber . 
every little sound just may be thunder , thunder from the barrel of he gun . 
maybe you will find you tomorrow drink in some bar to hide you sorrow , spend the time this you borrow , figure a way to get back home .
