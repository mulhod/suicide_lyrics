#one too many morning down the street the dog be bark and the day be get dark . 
as the night come in fall , the dog 'll lose they bark and the silent night will shatter from the sound inside me mind . 
yes , i 'm one too many morning and a thousand mile behind . 
from the crossroad of me doorstep me eye start to fade and i turn me head back to the room where me love and i have lay and i gaze back to the street , the sidewalk , and the sign and i 'm one too many morning and a thousand mile behind . 
it 's a restless , hungry feel this do n't mean no one no good when everything i 'm say you can say it just as good . 
you 're right from you side . 
i 'm right from me . 
we 're both just one too many morning and a thousand mile behind .
