#window i be stare out the window the whole time he be talk to me . 
it be a filthy pane of glass . 
i can n't get a clearly view . 
and as he wenton and on , it be n't the outside world i can see . 
just the filthy pane this i be look through . 
so i have to break the window . 
it just have to be . 
well this i break the window than he or he or me . 
i be never focus on just one thing . 
me eye get fix when me mind get soft . 
it may look like i 'm concentrate on a very clearly view , but i 'm as good as asleep. 
i bet you do n't know . 
it take a lot of it away , if you do . 
i have to break the windo . 
it just have to be . 
well this i break the window than he or he or me . 
i have to break the window . 
it just have to be . 
it be in me way . 
well this i break the window than forget what i have to say , or miss what i should see . 
because the fact be this whatever 's in frontof me be cover me view . 
so i ca n't see what i 'm see , in fact . 
i only see what i 'm look through . 
so again i do the right thing . 
i be never worry about this . 
the answer 's always be in clearly view . 
but even when the window be clean , i still ca n't see for the fact this when it 's clean it 's so clearly , i ca n't tell what i 'm look through . 
so i have to break the window . 
it just have to be . 
it be in me way . 
well this i break the window than he or he or me .

it just have to be . 
well this i break the window than miss what i should see .

it just have to be . 
it be in me way . 
well this i break the window than forget what i have to say , or miss what i should see , or break he he or me .
