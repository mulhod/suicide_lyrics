# not about love the early car already be draw deep breath past me door , and last night 's phrase sick with lack of basis be still writhe on me floor . 
and it do n't seem fair this you wicked word should work in hold me down . 
no , it do n't seem right to take information give at close range for the gag , and the bind and the ammunition round . 
conversation once color by esteem become duologue as a diagram of a play for blood take a vacation , me palate get clean . 
now i can taste you agenda while you 're spit you cud . 
and it do n't make sense i should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown . 
no , it do n't seem right to take information give at close range for the gag , and the bind , and the ammunition round . 
this be not about love . 
because i be not in love . 
in fact i ca n't stop fall out . 
this be not about love . 
because i be not in love . 
in fact i ca n't stop fall out . 
i miss this stupid ache . 
what be this posture i have to stare at . 
this 's what he say when i 'm sit up straight . 
change the name of the game because he lose , and he know he be wrong but he know it too late . 
but i 'm not be fair , because i choose to listen to this filthy mouth , but i 'd like to choose right . 
take all the thing this i 've say this he steal , put 'em in a sack , swing 'em over me shoulder , turn on me heel , step out of this sight . 
try to live in a lovely light . 
this be not about love . 
because i be not in love . 
in fact i ca n't stop fall out . 
this be not about love . 
because i be not in love . 
in fact i ca n't stop fall out .
