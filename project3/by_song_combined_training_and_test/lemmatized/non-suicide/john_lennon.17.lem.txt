#you be here from liverpool to tokyo , what a way to go . 
from distant land , one woman , one man . 
let the four wind blow . 
three thousand mile over the ocean , three thousand light-year from the land of the rise sun . 
love have open up me eye . 
love have blow right through . 
wherever you be , you be here . 
wherever you be , you be here . 
three thousand mile over the ocean , three thousand light-year from the land of the surprise sun . 
well , now , east be east and west be west . 
the twain shall meet . 
east be west and west be east . 
let it be complete . 
three thousand mile over the ocean , three thousand light-year from the land of the morning star .
