# the child be go darling , give me you absence tonight . 
take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white . 
let me sink in the silence this echo inside , and do n't bother leave the light on because i suddenly feel like a different person . 
from the root of me soul come a gentle coercion , and i run me hand o 'er a strange inversion , a vacancy this just do not belong . 
the child be go . 
honey help me out of this mess . 
i 'm a stranger to me but do n't reach for me . 
i 'm too far away . 
i do n't want to talk because there 's nothing leave to say . 
so me darling , give me you absence tonight . 
take all of you sympathy and leave it outside because there 's no kind of love this can make this all right . 
i 'm try to find a place i belong , and i suddenly feel like a different person . 
from the root of me soul come a gentle coersion , and i run me hand o 'er a strange inversion . 
as the darkness turn into the dawn , the child be go , the child be go .
