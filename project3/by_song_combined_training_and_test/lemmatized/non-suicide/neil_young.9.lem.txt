#harvest moon come a little bite close , hear what i have to say . 
just like child sleepinh , we can dream this night away . 
but there 's a full moon rise . 
let 's go dance in the light . 
we know where the music 's play . 
let 's go out and feel the night because i 'm still in love with you . 
i want to see you dance again because i 'm still in love with you on this harvest moon . 
when we be stranger , i watch you from afar . 
when we be lover , i love you with all me heart . 
but now it 's get late and the moon be climb high . 
i want to celebrate , see it shine in you eye , because i 'm still in love with you . 
i want to see you dance again , because i 'm still in love with you on this harvest moon .
