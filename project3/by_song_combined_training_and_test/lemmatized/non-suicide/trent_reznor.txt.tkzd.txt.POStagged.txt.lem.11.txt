#something i can never have i still recall the taste of me tear . 
echo you voice just like the ring in me ear . 
me favorite dream of you still wash ashore . 
scrape through me head 'till i do n't want to sleep anymore . 
you make this all go away . 
you make this all go away . 
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm start to scare me . 
you make this all go away . 
you make it all go away . 
i just want something . 
i just want something i can never have . 
you always be the one to show me how . 
back then i can n't do the thing this i can do now . 
this thing be slowly take me apart . 
grey will be the color if i have a heart . 
come on , tell me . 
you make this all go away . 
you make this all go away . 
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm start to scare me . 
you make this all go away . 
you make it all go away . 
i just want something . 
i just want something i can never have . 
in this place it seem like such a same . 
though it all look different now , i know it 's still the same . 
everywhere i look you 're all i see . 
just a fade , fuck reminder of who i use to be . 
you make this all go away . 
you make this all go away . 
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm start to scare me . 
you make this all go away . 
you make it all go away . 
i just want something . 
i just want something i can never have . 
i just want something i can never have .
