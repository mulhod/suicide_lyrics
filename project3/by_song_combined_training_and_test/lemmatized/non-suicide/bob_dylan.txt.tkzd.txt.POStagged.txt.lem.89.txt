#billy 4th there 's gun across the river about to pound you . 
there 's a lawman on you trail like to surround you . 
bounty hunter be dance all around you . 
billy , they do n't like you to be so free . 
camp out all night on the veranda , walk the street down by the hacienda , up to boot hill they 'd like to send you . 
billy , do n't you turn you back on me . 
there 's mirror inside the mind of crazy face , bullet-holes and rifle in they case . 
there 's always one more notch in four more ace , billy , and you 're play all alone . 
play around with some sweet seï¿½orita , into he dark chamber he will greet you , in the shadow of the mesa he will lead you , billy , and you 're go all alone . 
they say this pat garrett 's get you number , so sleep with one eye open when you wonder if every little sound just may be thunder , thunder from the barrel of he gun . 
there 's always another stranger sneak glance , some trigger-happy fool will to take chance , some old whore from san pedro 'll make advance , advance on you spirit and you soul . 
the businessman from taos want you to go down , so they 've hire mr . 
garrett . 
he 'll force you to slow down . 
billy , do n't it make you feel so low-down to be hunt by the man who be you friend ? 
so , hang on to you woman if you 've get one . 
remember in el paso once you shoot one ? 
i 'll be in santa fe about one . 
billy , you be run for so long . 
gypsy queen will play you grand finale way down in some tularosa alley , maybe in la rio pecas valley . 
billy , you 're so far away from home . 
billy , you 're so far away from home . 
billy , you 're so far away from home .
