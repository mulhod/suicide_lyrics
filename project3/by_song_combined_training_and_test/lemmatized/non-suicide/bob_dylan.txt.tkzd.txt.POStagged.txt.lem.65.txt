# the wicked messenger there be a wicked messenger . 
from eli he do come with a mind this multiply the small matter . 
when question who have send for he he answer with he thumb for he tongue , it can not speak but only flatter . 
he stay behind the assembly hall . 
it be there he make he be . 
oftentimes he can be see return until one day he just appear with a note in he hand , which read , " the sole of me foot , i swear they 're burn . 
" oh , the leave begin to fall and the sea begin to part and the people this confront he be many . 
and he be tell but this few word , which open up he heart . 
"if ye can bring good news , then do n't bring any .
