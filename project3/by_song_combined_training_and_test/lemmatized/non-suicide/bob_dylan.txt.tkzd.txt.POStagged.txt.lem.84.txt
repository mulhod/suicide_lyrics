# the man in me the man in me will do nearly any task and as for compensation there 's little he will ask . 
take a woman like you to get through to the man in me . 
storm cloud be rage all around me door . 
i think to me i may not take it anymore . 
take a woman like you kind to find the man in me . 
but , oh , what a wonderful feel just to know this you be near . 
it set me heart reel from me toe up to me ear . 
the man in me will hide sometime to keep from be see , but this 's just because he do n't want to turn into some machine . 
take a woman like you to get through to the man in me .
