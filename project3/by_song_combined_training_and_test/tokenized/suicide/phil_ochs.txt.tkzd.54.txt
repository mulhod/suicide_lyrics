#here 's to the state of mississippi

here 's to the state of mississippi for underneath her borders , the devil draws no lines .
if you drag her muddy river , nameless bodies you will find .
whoa , the fat trees of the forest have hid a thousand crimes .
the calender is lying when it reads the present time .
whoa here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of !
here 's to the people of mississippi , who say the folks up north , they just do n't understand .
and they tremble in their shadows at the thunder of the klan .
the sweating of their souls ca n't wash the blood from off their hands .
they smile and shrug their shoulders at the murder of a man .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
here 's to the schools of mississippi , where they 're teaching all the children that they do n't have to care .
all of rudiments of hatred are present everywhere and every single classroom is a factory of despair .
there 's nobody learning such a foreign word as fair .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
here 's to the cops of mississippi .
they 're chewing their tobacco as they lock the prison door .
their bellies bounce inside them as they knock you to the floor .
no , they do n't like taking prisoners in their private little war .
behind their broken badges there are murderers and more .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
and here 's to the judges of mississippi , who wear the robe of honor as they crawl into the court .
they 're guarding all the bastions with their phony legal fort .
oh , justice is a stranger when the prisoners report .
when the black man stands accused , the trial is always short .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
and here 's to the government of mississippi .
in the swamp of their bureaucracy they 're always bogging down and criminals are posing as the mayors of the towns .
they 're hoping that no one sees the sights and hears the sounds .
and the speeches of the governor are the ravings of a clown .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
and here 's to the laws of mississippi .
congressmen will gather in a circus of delay while the constitution is drowning in an ocean of decay .
unwed mothers should be sterilized , i 've even heard them say .
yes , corruption can be classic in the mississippi way .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
and here 's to the churches of mississippi , where the cross , once made of silver , now is caked with rust and the sunday morning sermons pander to their lust .
the fallen face of jesus is choking in the dust .
heaven only knows in which god they can trust .
oh , here 's to the land you 've torn out the heart of .
mississippi , find yourself another country to be part of .
