#i remember nothing

we were strangers .
we were strangers for way too long , for way too long .
we were strangers for way too long .
violent , violent .
were strangers .
get weak all the time .
may just pass the time .
me in my own world and you there beside .
the gaps are enormous .
we stare from each side .
we were strangers for way too long .
violent , more violent , his hand cracks the chair , moves on reaction , then slumps in despair .
trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon .
me in my own world , the one that you knew for way too long .
we were strangers for way too long .
we were strangers .
we were strangers for way too long , for way too long .
