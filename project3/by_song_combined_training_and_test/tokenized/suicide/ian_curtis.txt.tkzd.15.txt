#warsaw

i was there in the backstage when the first light came around .
i grew up like a changeling to win the first time around .
i can see all the weakness .
i pick all the faults .
well , i concede all the faith tests just to stick in your throats .
31g , 31g , 31g .
i hung around in your soundtrack to mirror all that you 've done , to find the right side of reason , to kill the three lies for one .
i can see all the cold facts .
i can see through your eyes .
all this talk made no contact no matter how hard we tried .
31g , 31g , 31g .
i can still hear the footsteps .
i can see only walls .
i slid into your man-traps with no hearing at all .
i just see contradiction , had to give up the fight just to live in the past tense , to make believe you were right .
31g , 31g , 31g .
