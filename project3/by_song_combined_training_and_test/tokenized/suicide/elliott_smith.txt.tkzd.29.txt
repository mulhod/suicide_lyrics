#everything means nothing to me

someone found the future as a statue in a fountain at attention , looking backward in a pool of water , wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder who keeps singing over everything .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
i picked up the song and found my picture in the paper .
the reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute people from a time when he was everything he 's supposed to be .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
everything means nothing to me .
