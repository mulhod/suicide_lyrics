#too many martyrs

in the state of mississippi many years ago , a boy of 14 years got a taste of southern law .
he saw his friend hanging and his color was his crime and the blood upon his jacket left a brand upon his mind .
too many martyrs and too many dead , too many lies , too many empty words were said .
too many times for too many angry men .
oh , let it never be again .
his name was medgar evers and he walked his road alone like emmett till and thousands more whose names we 'll never know .
they tried to burn his home and they beat him to the ground , but deep inside they both knew what it took to bring him down .
too many martyrs and too many dead , too many lies , too many empty words were said .
too many times for too many angry men .
oh , let it never be again .
the killer waited by his home hidden by the night as evers stepped out from his car into the rifle sight .
he slowly squeezed the trigger .
the bullet left his side .
it struck the heart of every man when evers fell and died .
too many martyrs and too many dead , too many lies , too many empty words were said .
too many times for too many angry men .
oh , let it never be again .
and they laid him in his grave while the bugle sounded clear , laid him in his grave when the victory was near , while we waited for the future for freedom through the land .
the country gained a killer and the country lost a man .
too many martyrs and too many dead , too many lies , too many empty words were said .
too many times for too many angry men .
oh , let it never be again .
