#paper cuts

when i 'm feeling tired , she pushed food through the door and i crawl towards the crack of light .
sometimes i ca n't find my way .
newspapers spread around , soaking all that they can .
a cleaning is due again , a good hosing down .
the lady whom i feel maternal love for cannot look me in the eyes , but i see hers and they are blue and they cock and twitch and masturbate !
i said so .
i said so .
i said so .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
black windows of paint i scratched with my nails .
i see others just like me .
why do they not try to escape ?
they bring out the older ones .
they point in my way .
they come with a flash of light and take my family away .
and very later i have learned to accept some friends of ridicule .
my whole existence is for your amusement and that is why i 'm here with you , to take me with .
you 're right .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
nirvana .
