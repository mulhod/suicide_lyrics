i feel a change coming on .
a frame of mind that 's held me down for too long , tried to imprison my soul , locked me outside of my own rock-n-roll .
can you feel it ?
oh , yeah .

it 's coming .
feel it , oh , yeah .

it 's coming my way , yeah .
i see a light from a night , a distant star , but it 's shining so bright , guiding me out of myself .
this newfound love has got me under its spell .

for years and years i 've waited so long .
i almost lost control .
the days and nights all seemed to be wrong without you , little miss rock-n-roll .
you know i tell you no lie .
my little lady , lift me up to the sky .
she put the stomp on my blues .
she blow the dust off my old blue suede shoes .
feel it , oh , yeah .
