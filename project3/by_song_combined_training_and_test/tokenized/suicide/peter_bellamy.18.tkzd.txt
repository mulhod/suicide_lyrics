# the ballad of henry and susannah , pt . 5

it was in the month of january australia 's coast drew near , and in that fair clime the sun did shine which filled their hearts with cheer .
and soon in peaceful sydney cove at anchor they did ride and admired the green and pleasant shore beyond the foaming tide .
then up spoke captain philip , for so richly dressed was he : " some man must bear me through the surf and keep me from the sea ! "
then up stepped henry cabell , being one both stout and tall , saying , " captain , i will be that man and will not let you fall . "
and so they sat them in the jolly boat , and the crew did pull for land .
and when they reached the shallows , henry o 'er the gunwale sprang .
he took the captain up on his back and he waded to the sand .
the very first of exiles in that distant part to stand .
and a fortnight later henry took susannah for his wife , the comfort of his darkest days to comfort him through life .
and when their years of sentence passed , their happiness did grow with property , prosperity and children also .
and so come all you gentle people who are lost in dark dismay , and remember that the blackest night must some time yield to day .
remember that the wildest storm eventually must pass and , like henry and susannah , may you find your joy at last .
