# the sound of music

see my true reflection .
cut off my own connections .
i can see life getting harder .
so sad is this sensation .
reverse the situation .
i ca n't see it getting better .
i 'll walk you through the heartbreak , show you all the outtakes .
i ca n't see it getting higher , systematically degraded , emotionally a scapegoat .
i ca n't see it getting better .
perverse and unrealistic .
try to make it all sick .
i ca n't see it getting better .
hollow now , i 'm burned out .
all i need to break out .
i ca n't see life getting higher .
love of life makes you feel higher .
love of life makes you feel higher , higher , higher , higher , higher , , higher , higher , higher , higher .
love of life makes you feel higher .
