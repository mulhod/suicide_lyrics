#orange juice blues ( blues for breakfast )

i had a hard time waking this morning .
i got a lotta things on my mind , like those friends of yours .
they keep bringing me down , just hanging around all the time .
i 've had a hard time waking most mornings and it 's been that way for a month or more .
you 've had things your way , but now i 've got to say i 'm on my way out the door .
why do n't you get right , try to get right , baby ?
you have n't been right with me .
why do n't you get right , try and get right , baby ?
do n't you remember how it used to be ?
why do n't you get right , try to get right , baby ?
you have n't been right with me .
why do n't you get right , try and get right , baby ?
do n't you remember how it used to be ?
you had a hard time waking this morning and i can see it in your empty eyes , but there 's no need for talking or walking round the block just to figure out the reason why .
i have a hard time handing out warnings .
i 'll just slide on out the door because i 'm tired of everything being beautiful , beautiful , and i ai n't coming back no more .
why do n't you get right , try to get right , baby ?
you have n't been right with me .
why do n't you get right , try and get right , baby ?
do n't you remember how it used to be ?
