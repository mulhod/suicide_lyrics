#i once lived in service

i once lived in service to a lady so fine .
i 've served her by night and by day .
i 've carried the dishes when the lady would dine , and after , i cleared them away .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is all slavery .
i 've made up her bed , and i turned down her sheets .
i ironed the dresses she wore .
i 've peeled her potatoes .
i 've roasted her meats .
and it was i , with my broom , swept her floor .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is all misery .
i scrubbed her front doorstep.
i polished her plate .
i put coals in the pan for her bed .
i 've rose before sunlight to blacklead her grate , and at midnight i 've laid down my head .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is all drudgery .
i 've carried her water .
i 've answered her door .
i 've polished the shoes for her feet .
and when she went to church , then her prayer-book i bore behind as she marched down the street .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant 's a penance to me .
now , i met a young man in the village one day as i run to the shop for her bread .
he 's asked me my name , but i had to away lest me mistress should break me poor head .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant has no liberty .
so that night as i lay in my attic so bare , i resolved that i would run away .
and all for to honor the waggoner 's fare , some silver spoons took for me pay .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant is melancholy .
now i lie in prison but i will not weep.
who knows what tomorrow may hold ?
there 's some fine lads in here for my company to keep.
there 's strong arms to keep me from cold .
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a convict is all chivalry !
now i 've known confinement the most of me years .
small freedom did i ever know .
some prisons , sure , they have no cold iron bars , but some prisons , why , they have no men !
oh dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a convict 's a pleasure to me .
dear me , how can it be ?
the life of a servant was never so free !
