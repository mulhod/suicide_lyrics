# the thresher

in portsmouth town on the eastern shore where many a fine ship was born , the thresher was built and the thresher was launched and the crew of the thresher was sworn .
she was shaped like a tear .
she was built like a shark .
she was made to run fast and free .
and the builders shook their hands and the builders shared their wine .
thought that they had mastered the sea .
yes , she 'll always run silent and she 'll always run deep though the ocean has no pity , though the waves will never weep.
they 'll never weep.
and they marveled at her speed and they marveled at her depth and they marveled at her deadly design .
and they sailed to every land and they sailed to every port just to see what faults they could find .
then they put her on the land for nine months to stand and they worked on her from stem to stern .
but they could never see it was their coffin to be for the sea was waiting for their return .
yes , she 'll always run silent and she 'll always run deep though the ocean has no pity , though the waves will never weep.
they 'll never weep.
on a cold wednesday morn they put her out to sea when the waves , they were nine feet high .
and they dove beneath the waves and they dove to their graves and they never said a last goodbye .
and it 's deeper and deeper and deeper they dove just to see what their ship could stand .
but the hull gave a moan and the hull gave a groan and they plunged to the deepest , darkest sand .
now she lies in the depths of the darkened ocean floor , covered by the waters cold and still .
oh , ca n't you see the wrong ?
she was a death ship all along .
died before she had a chance to kill .
and she 'll never run silent and she 'll never run deep for the ocean had no pity and the waves they never weep.
they never weep.
