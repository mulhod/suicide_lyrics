#heart-shaped box

she eyes me like a pisces when i am weak .
i 've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks .
i 've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap .
i wish i could eat your cancer when you turn back .
hey !
wait !
i 've got a new complaint , forever in debt to your priceless advice .
hey !
wait !
i 've got a new complaint , forever in debt to your priceless advice .
hey ! wait !
i 've got a new complaint , forever in debt to your priceless advice , your advice .
meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet .
cut myself on angel 's hair and baby 's breath .
broken hymen of your highness , i 'm left black .
throw down your umbilical noose , so i can climb right back .
hey !
wait !
i 've got a new complaint , forever in debt to your priceless advice .
hey !

i 've got a new complaint , forever in debt to your priceless advice .
