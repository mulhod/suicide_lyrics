# i 'm in love

i 'm not well .
ca n't you tell ?
i 've never felt like this before .
very strange , got no pain , but i ca n't wait to get some more .
i 'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about .
i 'm in love and you taught me .
now you 're all i 'm thinking of .
hold me tight every night .
never go away from me .
say you will love me still .
i 'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about .
i 'm in love and you taught me .
now you 're all i 'm thinking of .
where have you been all my life ?
i 'd like to make us man and wife
what about a house just for us ?
see the children on the bus .
i 'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about .
i 'm in love and you taught me .
now you 're all i 'm thinking of .
i 'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about .
i 'm in love and you taught me .
now you 're all i 'm thinking of .
