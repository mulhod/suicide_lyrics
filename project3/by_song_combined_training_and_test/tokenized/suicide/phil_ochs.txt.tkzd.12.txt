# i 'm tired

sometimes i feel that the world is n't mine .
it feeds on my hunger and tears on my time .
and i 'm tired .
yes , i 'm tired .
every face on the street is as cold as the air , as hard as the pavement moves beneath my feet .
and i 'm tired .
yes , i 'm tired .
sometimes i stop and ask to myself , oh , why should i be so alone ?
it comes and it goes and nobody knows for they 're blind with a pain all their own .
so i start out again with a smile on my face to hide all the empty and search for a friend .
and i 'm tired .
yes , i 'm tired .
