# the robber 's song

my name is abe carman .
my trade it is right charming , for you know there is no harm in a little burglary .
i live by taking chances , like the heroes of romances , and taking what i fancies with bold audacity !
there 's wealth all for the taking , and there is no mistaking , my fortune i am making with a little robbery .
no man shall be my master as long as i run faster than those that would me blast for taking things for free !
i 've robbed the great and wealthy in manner sly and stealthy , but it 's just to keep me healthy as you can plainly see .
no watch , no ring , no clock it is not safe within your pocket , and it will avail you naught to lock it from light-fingered gentry !
