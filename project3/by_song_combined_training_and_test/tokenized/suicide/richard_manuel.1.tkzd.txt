#in a station

once i walked through the halls of a station .
someone called your name .
in the streets i heard children laughing .
they all sound the same .
wonder , could you ever know me , know the reason why i live ?
is there nothing you can show me ?
life seems so little to give .
once i climbed up the face of a mountain and ate the wild fruit there , fell asleep until the moonlight woke me and i could taste your hair .
is n't everybody dreaming ?
then the voice i hear is real .
out of all the idle scheming , ca n't we have something to feel ?
once upon a time they used me indeed .
tomorrow never comes .
i could sing the sound of your laughter .
still i do n't know your name .
must be some way to repay you out of all the good you gave .
if a rumour should delay you , love seems so little to say .
