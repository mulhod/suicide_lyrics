#lou marsh

on the streets of new york city when the hour was getting late , there were young men armed with knives and guns , young men armed with hate .
and lou marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks for one man is no army when the city turns its back .
and now the streets are empty .
now the streets are dark , so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in el barrio with the orphans of the night .
he left behind a chamber of a church he served so long for he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs .
his church became an alley and his pulpit was the street and he made his congregation from the boys he used to meet .
and now the streets are empty .
now the streets are dark , so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in el barrio with the orphans of the night .
there were two gangs approaching in spanish harlem town .
the smell of blood was in the air .
the challenge was laid down .
he felt their blinding hatred and he tried to save their lives and the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives .
and now the streets are empty .
now the streets are dark , so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in el barrio with the orphans of the night .
will lou marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave ?
will his memory still linger on in those he tried to save ?
all of us who knew him will now and then recall and shed a tear on poverty , tombstone of us all , for now the streets are empty .
now the streets are dark , so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in el barrio with the orphans of the night .
