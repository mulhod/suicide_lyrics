# when i say

what you are is what i see .
what i see is what i want it to be .
when i say i love you , what i mean is i really do .
i 'm not the one who 'll give you everything you need , but what i mean is that i 'll try .
i ca n't deny that i 've been burning inside for all the things i 'll never see .
so come on , be yourself , nothing else .
who could ask for any more ?
and you know , they all love you .
what is more , i really do .
i 'm not the one who 'll give you everything you need , but what i mean is that i 'll try .
i ca n't deny that i 've been burning inside for all the things i 'll never see .
