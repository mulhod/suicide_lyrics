# the humane turnkey ( 1 )

" come rise you up , john simpson , " the governor did say .
" these scum are chained and ready , and it 's time you was away .
three woman and a farthing child , to plymouth they are bound ,
and you must be their escort till they reach that distant town . "
when me and these poor convicts did arrive at plymouth strand , i marched them up onto the deck all chained hand to hand .
the captain saw us come aboard and he did prove unkind .
" the women come , " he did declare , " but the infant stays behind . "
this proud unfeeling seaman , captain gilbert was his name .
oh , to see a babe abandoned so , i swore it was a shame .
i wrapped it up in my great-coat , to the coach i went straightway and i started out for london town without no more delay .
