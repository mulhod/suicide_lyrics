#floyd the barber

bell on door clanks .
come on in .
floyd observes my hairy chin .
sit down in the chair .
do n't be afraid .
steamed hot towel on my face .
i 'm ashamed .
i 'm ashamed .
i 'm ashamed .
barney ties me to the chair .
i ca n't see .
i 'm really scared .
floyd breathes hard .
i hear a zip .
pee-pee pressed against my lips .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
i sense others in the room .
opie aunt bee , i presume .
they take turns and cut me up .
i die smothered in andy 's clutch .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
i was shamed .
