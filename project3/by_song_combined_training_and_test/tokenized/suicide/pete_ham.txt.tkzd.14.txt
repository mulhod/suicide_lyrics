#knocking down our home

your heart is in your home , they say .
your home 's where you belong .
but someone stole my heart today , so listen to my song .
i heard the news today .
they 're going to move us far away .
seems that our home must go .
they 're going to build a motorway .
it is n't fair .
nobody cares .
they 're knocking down our home , ruining all we own .
they 're knocking down our home .
please help us .
do n't let them take our home .
ma 's cooking at the stove , where she 's cooked for thirty years .
ten thousand meals she 's cooked , but now her eyes are filled with tears .
it is n't fair .
nobody cares .
they 're knocking down our home , ruining all we own .
