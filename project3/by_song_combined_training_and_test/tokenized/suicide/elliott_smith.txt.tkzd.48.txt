# a passing feeling

everything is gone but the echo of the burst of a shell and i 'm stuck here waiting for a passing feeling in the city i built up and blew to hell .
i 'm stuck here waiting for a passing feeling .
still i sinned all the time .
my request for relief down the dead power lines though i 'm beyond belief in the help i require just to exist at all .
took a long time to stand .
took an hour to fall .
