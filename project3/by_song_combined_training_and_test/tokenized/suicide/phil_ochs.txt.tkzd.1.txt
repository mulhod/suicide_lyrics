do what i have to do

all around this country , trouble in the air and i hear the voices calling me , asking , "do you know and do you care ?
do you know and do you care ? "
so i 'm going to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm going to be what i have to be .
now , wo n't you come on along with me ?
wo n't you come along with me ?
do n't want to cause no sorrow .
do n't want to cause no pain .
i 'm only going to cause what i have to cause until this land is free of shame , till this land is free of shame .
so i 'm going to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm going to be what i have to be .
now , wo n't you come on along with me ?
wo n't you come along with me ?
only one thing i know , i know we 're not alone .
was a million here before we came .
be a million when we 're gone , we 're gone , million when we 're gone .
so i 'm going to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm going to be what i have to be .
now , wo n't you come on along with me ?
wo n't you come along with me ?
oh , i 'm afraid of trouble .
yes , i 'm afraid of jail .
but i 'm more afraid , lord , not to try , more afraid of what happens now if we fail , what happens now if we fail .
so i 'm going to do what i have to do , say what i have to say , and i 'm going to be what i have to be .
now , wo n't you come on along with me ?
wo n't you come along with me ?
