#almost over

think i 'm unkind ?
the people are n't the way you think they are .
they ca n't remember all the time what it was you wanted .
they paint you out in straight silhouette , but do n't you get the picture yet ?
why you getting all upset ?
the worst part is almost over .
three 's such a crowd .
you ought to tell me what you tell yourself .
you ever going to speak it aloud ?
do i have to guess like everyone else ?
with an iron will to walk the walk and the glass jaw that ca n't be moved to talk , black eyes always watch the clock .
the worst part is almost over .
you let yourself be froze by death .
you think i 'm mean because i call you out .
you do n't know what you 're about .
the worst part is almost over now .
the worst part is almost over now , now , now .
