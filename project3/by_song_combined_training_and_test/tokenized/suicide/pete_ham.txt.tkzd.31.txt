# just a chance

does n't matter what you think i do .
all i want to do is see it through .
you may say it 's not a great romance , but all i want from you is just a chance to try , any way at all .
do n't you think we know it has to hurt ?
are minds that small ?
i wo n't tell you if it 's short or long .
all i know is that it do n't feel wrong .
you may say it 's not a great romance , but all we want from you is just a chance to try any way we can .
do n't you think we know it has to hurt ?
wo n't you understand ?
