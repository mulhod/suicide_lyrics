# and her daddy 's a millionaire

priscilla bagshot lives in a house with a hundred and twenty rooms , with butlers and bakers and candlestick vapors and horses and horsesgrooms .
people do n't like her .
they say she 's a fool , but i know i disagree .
i know her better .
she`ll lend me ten-bob and i know she 's in love with me .
oh , oh , she 's a beautiful girl .
she does n't have a care .
oh , oh , she 's a wonderful girl and her daddy 's a millionaire .
i meet her on sundays .
we go for a ride and it means the world to me .
she lets me take her out to the woods , then back to her house for tea .
people do n't like her .
they say she 's a fool , but i know i disagree .
i know her better .
she 'll lend me ten-bob and i know she 's in love with me .
daddy 's a millionaire .
daddy 's a millionaire .
daddy 's a millionaire .
