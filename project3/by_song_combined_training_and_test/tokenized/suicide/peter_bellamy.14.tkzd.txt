# the humane turnkey ( 2 )

now when i came to london , having rode two hundred mile , to see a turnkey nurse a babe , it cause the crowd to smile .
but hearing its sad history , it made the crowd to groan , and many a worthy citizen swore justice would be done .
then up and spoke a gentleman and loudly did declare that only one man in the land could settle the affair .
so to lord sydney 's house i went , the crowd did follow on , for they swore they would see charity before the day was done .
when we came to lord sydney 's house , it was the hour of nine .
we all came bursting in on him as he sat down to dine .
he listened to my story , and his countenance was grave , then declared that ere the week was out , the family would be saved .
lord sydney wrote two letters and he signed them with his hand , one to plymouth , one to norwich , bidding them to understand that young cabell and the baby with susannah were to go as a united family unto that distant shore .
now i 'm home again in norwich but some other trade i 'll seek as a coachman or a waggoner , a shopman or a sweep .
perhaps i 'll take the shilling or go wear the jacket blue .
there 's no trade but it 's the kinder , so locks and bars , adieu !
