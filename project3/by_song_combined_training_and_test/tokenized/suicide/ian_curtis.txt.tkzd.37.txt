#shadowplay

to the centre of the city where all roads meet waiting for you , to the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank searching for you , i was moving through the silence without motion , waiting for you .
in a room with a window in the corner i found truth .
in the shadow-play , acting out your own death , knowing no more , as the assassins all grouped in four lines , dancing on the floor , and with cold steel , odor on their bodies made a move to connect , but i could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left .
i did everything , everything i wanted to .
i let them use you for their own ends .
to the center of the city in the night waiting for you .
to the center of the city in the night waiting for you .
