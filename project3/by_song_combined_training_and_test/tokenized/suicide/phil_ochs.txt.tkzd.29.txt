# what 's that i hear

what 's that i hear now ringing in my ear ?
i 've heard that sound before .
what 's that i hear now ringing in my ear ?
i hear it more and more .
it 's the sound of freedom calling , ringing up to the sky .
it 's the sound of the old ways falling .
you can hear it if you try .
you can hear it if you try .
what 's that i see now shining in my eyes ?
i 've seen that light before .
what 's that i see now shining in my eyes ?
i see it more and more .
it 's the light of freedom shining , shining up to the sky .
it 's the light of the old ways dying .
you can see it if you try
what 's that i feel now beating in my heart ?
i 've felt that beat before .
what 's that i feel now beating in my heart ?
i feel it more and more .
it 's the rumble of freedom calling , climbing up to the sky .
it 's the rumble of the old ways falling .
you can feel it if you try .
