#candidate

forced by the pressure , the territories marked .
no longer the pleasure .
oh , i 've since lost the heart .
corrupted from memory , no longer the power .
it 's creeping up slowly , that last fatal hour .
oh , i do n't know what made me .
what gave me the right to mess with your values and change wrong to right ?
please keep your distance .
the trail leads to here .
there 's blood on your fingers , brought on by fear .
i campaigned for nothing .
i worked hard for this .
i tried to get to you .
you treat me like this .
it 's just second nature .
it 's what we 've been shown .
we 're living by your rules .
that 's all that we know .
i tried to get to you .
i tried to get to you .
i tried to get to you .
i tried to get to you .
