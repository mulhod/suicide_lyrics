#maybe tomorrow

listen to a lonely sound .
see the grey and sadness all around .
see the people go their way .
care not of me and the love i 've lost today .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've looked into her eyes .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've seen her once or twice .
and so i 'm living for a dream .
each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine .
i 'll make believe that i do n't care .
i 'll tell my friends i love my life .
i 'm happy .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've looked into her eyes .
maybe tomorrow i will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've seen her once or twice .
wherever , whoever you may be , let the light of your love shine through the window of my heart .
then when you 've colored all my thoughts bright , do n't let me ever ever think of night , no yeah !
maybe tomorrow you will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've looked into her eyes .
maybe tomorrow you will love again .
i 'll never know until i 've seen her once or twice .
maybe tomorrow you will love again .
