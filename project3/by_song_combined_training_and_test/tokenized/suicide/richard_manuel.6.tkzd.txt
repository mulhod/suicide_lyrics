# when you awake

ollie told me , i 'm a fool , so i walked on down the road a mile , went to the house that brings a smile , sat upon my grandpa 's knee and what do you think he said to me ?
when you awake , you will remember everything .
you will be hanging on a string from your...
when you believe , you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know .
ollie showed me the fork in the road .
you can take to the left or go straight to the right .
use your days and save your nights .
careful where you step and watch what you eat .
sleep with the light and you got it beat .
when you awake , you will remember everything .
you will be hanging on a string from your...
when you believe , you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know .
ollie warned me , it 's mean old world .
the street do n't greet you , yes , it 's true .
what am i supposed to do ?
read the writing on the wall .
i heard it when i was very small .
when you awake , you will remember everything .
you will be hanging on a string from your...
when you believe , you will relieve the only soul that you were born with to grow old and never know .
wash my hands in lye water , i got a date with the captain 's daughter .
you can go and tell your brother .
we sure gonna love one another , oh , yeah .
may be right and you might be wrong .
i ai n't gonna worry all day long .
snow 's gonna come and the frost gonna bite .
my old car froze up last night .
ai n't no reason to hang my head .
i could wake up in the morning dead .
if i thought it would do any good , i 'd stand on the rock where moses ...
