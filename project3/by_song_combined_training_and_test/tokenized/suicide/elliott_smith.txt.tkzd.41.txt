#let 's get lost

i 've been outside , invited in , but i could n't abide , would n't miss it again .
burning every bridge that i cross to find some beautiful place to get lost .
i had true love .
i made it die .
i pushed her away .
she said , please stay .
burning every bridge that i cross to find some beautiful place to get lost , to find some beautiful place to get lost .
well , i do n't know where i 'll go now and i do n't really care who follows me there , but i 'll burn every bridge that i cross and find some beautiful place to get lost and find some beautiful place to get lost .
