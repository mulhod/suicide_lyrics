# the ballad of henry and susannah , pt . 4

for three long years and upward in that dark and bitter cell young henry and susannah they lovingly did dwell .
and in seventeen and eighty six , she bore him a baby boy .
who would believe that such a pit could ever hold such joy ?
but sorrow quickly followed which did pierce them to the heart for the news was to them carried that their family must part .
young henry was to stay in jail , as he did understand , while susannah she was to be sent to far van diemen 's land .
down on his knees he pleaded , all from his breaking heart , that from his own dear loved ones he would not be forced to part .
but in that dreary dungeon young henry had to stay as his sweetheart and his little son to plymouth were conveyed .
