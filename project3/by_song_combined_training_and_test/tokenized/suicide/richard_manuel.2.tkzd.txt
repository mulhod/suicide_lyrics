# we can talk

we can talk about it now .
it 's that same old riddle only starting from the middle .
i 'd fix it , but i do n't know how .
well , we could try to reason , but you might think it 's treason .
one voice for all , echoing along the hall .
do n't give up on father clock .
we can talk about it now .
come , let me show you how to keep the wheels turning .
you 've got to keep the engine churning .
but did you ever milk a cow ?
i had the chance one day , but i was all dressed up for sunday .
everybody , everywhere , do you really care ?
well , then , pick up your heads and walk .
we can talk about it now .
it seems to me we 've been holding something underneath our tongues .
i 'm afraid if you ever got a pat on the back , it would likely burst your lungs .
stop me if i should sound kind of down in the mouth , but i 'd rather be burned in canada than to freeze here in the south .
moving that eternal plough .
we 've got to find a sharper blade or have a new one made .
rest awhile and cool your brow .
do n't you see there 's no need to slave , the whip is in the grave .
no , no trance .
it 's safe now to take a backward glance because the flames have turned to chalk .
we can talk about it now .
