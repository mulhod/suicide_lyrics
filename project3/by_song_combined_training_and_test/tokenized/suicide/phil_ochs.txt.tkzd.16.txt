#one more parade

hup , two , three , four , marching down the street , rolling of the drums and the tramping of the feet .
general salutes and the mothers wave and weep.
here comes the big parade .
do n't be afraid .
price is paid .
one more parade .
so young , so strong , so ready for the war , so willing to go and die upon a foreign shore .
all march together .
everybody looks the same , so there is no one you can blame .
do n't be ashamed .
light the flame .
one more parade .
listen for the sound and listen for the noise .
listen for the thunder of the marching boys .
few years ago their guns were only toys .
here comes the big parade .
do n't be afraid .
price is paid .
one more parade .
medals on their coats and guns in their hands .
trained to kill as they 're trained to stand .
ten thousand ears need only one command .
here comes the big parade .
do n't be afraid .
price is paid .
one more parade .
cold hard stares on faces so proud .
kisses from the girls and cheers from the crowd .
and the widows from the last war cry into their shrouds .
here comes the big parade .
do n't be afraid .
price is paid .
do n't be ashamed .
war 's a game .
world in flames .
so start the parade .
