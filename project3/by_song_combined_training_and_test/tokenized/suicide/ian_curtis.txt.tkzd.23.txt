#these days

morning seems strange , almost out of place .
searched hard for you and your special ways .
these days , these days .
spent all my time .
learnt a killer 's art .
took threats and abuse till i 'd learned the part .
can you stay for these days ?
these days , these days .
used outward deception to get away , broken heart romance to make it pay .
these days , these days .
we 'll drift through it all .
it 's the modern age .
take care of it all now these debts are paid .
can you stay for these days ?
