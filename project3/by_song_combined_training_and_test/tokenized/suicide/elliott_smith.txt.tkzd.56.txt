#high times

coma kid taught me how he 'd come to follow you around wherever you go , said i do n't go where i 'm supposed to go , and i do n't go really anywhere , you know ?
told me how he 's driven by a curse till he kicked out into reverse , said i do n't go where i 'm supposed to go , and i do n't go really anywhere , you know ?
i made up my mind and i do n't mind saying so .
i went to meet you at central square and , when i could n't find you there , i went walking around the city some more , people-watching with a cold , blank stare , and i saw your face in everyone , i swear .
seems i never get your kick quite right .
i was walking slow to a dirty dive .
i 'm so sick and tired trying to change your mind when it 's so easy to disconnect mine .
high times , high times , high times .
yeah , i feel fine .
high times , high times , high times .
man , i feel fine .
do n't pick me up .
i 'm fine right where i am .
i do n't go where i 'm supposed to go , where i 'm supposed to go .
