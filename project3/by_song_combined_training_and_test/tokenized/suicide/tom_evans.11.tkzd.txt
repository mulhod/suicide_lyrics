# where do we go from here

someone gives you their heart , but you still throw it all away , knowing the past is a part , part of what you are today .
we all know you had your troubles .
we all know you had your days .
what is love ?
you can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride , telling yourself you 're a loser like someone winning who 's not , telling yourself you 're a loser .
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
where do you go from here ?
someone showed you the way that you 'll be ready to see that the game had been played .
losers had lost , and the winners were free .
we all know you have your troubles .
we all know you have your ways .
what is love ?
you can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride , telling yourself you 're a loser like someone winning who 's not , telling yourself you 're a loser .
where do you go from here ?
