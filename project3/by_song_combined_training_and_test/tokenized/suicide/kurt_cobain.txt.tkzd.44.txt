#turnaround

take a step outside yourself and you turn around .
take a look at who you are .
it 's pretty scary , so silly .
it 's revolting .
you 're not much .
you ca n't do anything .
take a step outside the city and you turn around .
take a look at what you are .
it is revolting .
you 're really nowhere , so wasteful , so foolish , poppycock !
who said do n't look back ?
do n't believe them .
go for that crazy sounding restaurant because they 're going to try and get behind you .
do n't you let them do it .
you know what i 'm talking about ?
you hear me talking ?
you hear me talking ?
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
it 's pretty scary .
it 's so revolting .
take a step outside the country and you turn around .
take a look at what you are .
it is amazing .
take a good look .
you 're no big deal .
you 're so petty .
it 's a laugh .
take a step outside the planet .
turn around and around .
take a look at where you are .
it 's pretty scary .
