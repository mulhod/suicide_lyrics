#between the bars

drink up , baby , stay up all night .
the things you could do , you wo n't but you might .
the potential you 'll be that you 'll never see .
the promises you 'll only make .
drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days .
do what i say and i 'll make you okay and drive them away , the images stuck in your head .
people you 've been before that you do n't want around anymore that push and shove and wo n't bend to your will .
i 'll keep them still
drink up , baby , look at the stars .
i 'll kiss you again between the bars where i 'm seeing you there with your hands in the air waiting to finally be caught .
drink up one more time and i 'll make you mine , keep you apart deep in my heart separate from the rest where i like you the best and keep the things you forgot .
the people you 've been before that you do n't want around anymore that push and shove and wo n't bend to your will .
i 'll keep them still .
