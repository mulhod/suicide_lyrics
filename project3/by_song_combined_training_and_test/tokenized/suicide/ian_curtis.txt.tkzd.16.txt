#leaders of men

born from some mother 's womb , just like any other room .
made a promise for a new life .
made a victim out of your life .
when your time 's on the door and it drips to the floor and you feel you can touch ,
all the noise is too much and the seeds that are sown are no longer your own .
just a minor operation to force a final ultimatum .
thousand words are spoken loud reach the dumb to fool the crowd .
when you walk down the street and the sound 's not so sweet and you wish you could hide ,
maybe go for a ride to some peep-show arcade , where the future 's not made .
a nightmare situation infiltrates imagination , smacks of past holy wars by the wall with broken laws .
the leaders of men , born out of your frustration .
the leaders of men , just a strange infatuation .
the leaders of men made a promise for a new life , no saviour for our sakes to twist the internees of hate , self-induced manipulation to crush all thoughts of mass salvation .
