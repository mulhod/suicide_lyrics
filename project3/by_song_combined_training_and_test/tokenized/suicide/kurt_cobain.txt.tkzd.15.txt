#scentless apprentice

like most babies smell like butter , his smell smelled like no other .
he was born scentless and senseless .
he was born a scentless apprentice .
go away .
get away .
get away .
every wet nurse refused to feed him .
electrolytes smell like semen .
i promise not to sell your perfumed secrets .
there are countless formulas for pressing flowers .
go away .
get away .
get away .
i lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms .
leaking-out gas fumes are made into perfume .
you ca n't fire me because i quit !
throw me in the fire and i wo n't throw a fit .
go away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
get away .
