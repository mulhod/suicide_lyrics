# no name # 3

we arrived too late .
our mouths were opening .
i turned off the light .
so come on night .
you 're a witness , you .
you 've seen me interrupt
a good old-fashioned fight .
so come on night .
everyone is gone , home to oblivion , home to oblivion , home to oblivion .
watched the dying day blushing in the sky .
everyone is uptight .
so come on night .
everyone is gone , home to oblivion , home to oblivion , home to oblivion .
i know we 're not illegitimate in our hearing .
so come on , so come on night .
