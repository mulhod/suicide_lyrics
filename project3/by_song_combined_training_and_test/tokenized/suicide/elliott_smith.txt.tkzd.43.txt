#do n't go down

i met a girl , snowball , in hell .
she was hard and as cracked as the liberty bell .
i got her to come on and move in with me and i said i 'd find a better place .
we could spend eternity .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
her mama called me a thief and her dad called himself commander in chief .
i fought him off with my love , but i knew the sense of worthlessness she would have to raise above .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
she had a dream , woke up in shock .
she had seen her own body outlined in chalk .
i split the scene , the globe been spun , and her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun .
do n't go down .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
do n't go down .
stay with me , baby , stay .
