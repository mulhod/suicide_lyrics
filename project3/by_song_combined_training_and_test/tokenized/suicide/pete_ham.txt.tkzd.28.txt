#name of the game

saw the railway master and i looked him in the eye .
said , "would you go much faster if you thought that you would die ? "
he said , " not me , sir .
i could not care .
in fact , i would not try .
protest would not take me far .
it 's different , me not being a star . "
i lock my feelings in a jar until another day .
comfort me , dear brother .
wo n't you tell me what you know ?
somewhere in this painful world is a place where i can go .
oh , long-awaiting mother , is it time to make a show and take your babies to your breast ?
no , we never passed the test and all our sins should be confessed before we carry on .
oh , do n't refuse me .
if you choose me , you 'll follow my shame .
no , do n't confuse me for i know it 's the name of the game .
got up off my pillow and i looked up at the sun .
said , "you can see quite clearly now the things that we have done . "
we burned your sacred willow and our battles we have won , but did we get so very far ?
it 's different , me not being a star .
lock my feelings in a jar until we go away .
oh , do n't refuse me .
if you choose me , you 'll follow my shame .
no , do n't confuse me for i know it 's the name of the game .
oh , do n't refuse me .
if you choose me , you 'll follow my shame .
no , do n't confuse me for i know that 's the name of the game .
do n't refuse me .
do n't confuse me .
oh , oh , oh .
do n't refuse me .
do n't confuse me .
oh , oh , oh .
