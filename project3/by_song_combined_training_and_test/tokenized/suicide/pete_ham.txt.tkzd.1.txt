apple of my eye

oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to move away though inside my heart , i really want to stay .
believe the love we have is so sincere .
you know , the gift you have will always be .
you 're the apple of my eye .
you 're the apple of my heart , but now the time has come to part .
oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to make a stand though we never meant to bite the loving hand .
and now the time has come to walk alone .
we were the children .
now we 've overgrown .
you 're the apple of my eye .
you 're the apple of my heart , but now the time has come to part .
oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to move away though inside my heart , i really want to stay .
believe the love we have is so sincere .
you know , the gift you have will always be .
you 're the apple of my eye .
you 're the apple of my heart , but now the time has come to part .
now the time has come to part .
now the time has come to part .
