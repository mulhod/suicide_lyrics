#it 's all over now , baby blue

you must leave now .
take what you need , you think will last , but whatever you wish to keep , you better grab it fast .
yonder stands your orphan with his gun , crying like a fire in the sun .
look out , the saints are coming through and it 's all over now , baby blue .
the highway is for gamblers .
better use your sense ,
take what you have gathered from coincidence .
the empty-handed painter from your streets is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets ,
the sky , too , is folding under you and it 's all over now , baby blue .
all your seasick sailors , they 're all rowing home .
your own empty-handed army is all going home .
your lover , who just walked out your door , has taken all his blankets from the floor .
the carpet , too , is moving under you and it 's all over now , baby blue .
leave your stepping-stones behind .
there 's something that calls for you .
forget the dead you 've left .
they will not follow you .
the vagabond who 's rapping at your door is standing in the clothes that you once wore .
strike another match .
go start anew .
and it 's all over now , baby blue .
