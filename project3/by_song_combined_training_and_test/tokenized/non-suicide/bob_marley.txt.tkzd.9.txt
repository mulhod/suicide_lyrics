#concrete jungle

no sun will shine in my day today .
no sun will shine .
the high yellow moon wo n't come out to play .
that high yellow moon wo n't come out to play .
i said darkness has covered my light .
and the stage my day into night , yeah .
where is the love to be found ?
wo n't someone tell me because my sweet life must be somewhere to be found instead of concrete jungle where the living is harder , concrete jungle !
man , you got to do your best , oh , yeah .
no chains around my feet , but i 'm not free , oh ooh !
i know i am bound here in captivity .
g 'yeah , i 've never known happiness .
i 've never known what sweet caress is .
still , i 'll be always laughing like a clown .
wo n't someone help me because i i 've got to pick myself from off the ground .
must be somewhere for me , eh , yeah , in this a concrete jungle !
i said , what do you cry for me now , oh !
concrete jungle , ah , wo n't you let me be , now , hey , oh , now !
i said that life , sweet life , it must be somewhere to be found , must be somewhere for me .
oh , instead , concrete jungle , confusion , confusion , confusion , eh !
concrete jungle , baby , you 've got it in .
concrete jungle , now , eh , concrete jungle , what do you got for me now ?
