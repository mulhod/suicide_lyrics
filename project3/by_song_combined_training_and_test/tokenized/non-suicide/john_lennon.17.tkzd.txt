#you are here

from liverpool to tokyo , what a way to go .
from distant lands , one woman , one man .
let the four winds blow .
three thousand miles over the ocean , three thousand light-years from the land of the rising sun .
love has opened up my eyes .
love has blown right through .
wherever you are , you are here .
wherever you are , you are here .
three thousand miles over the ocean , three thousand light-years from the land of the surprising sun .
well , now , east is east and west is west .
the twain shall meet .
east is west and west is east .
let it be complete .
three thousand miles over the ocean , three thousand light-years from the land of the morning star .
