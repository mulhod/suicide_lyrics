#mirrored sea

well , he called the whole thing such a wild mistake .
he said he did n't mean no harm .
well , it was a big to-do , but nothing else was new .
his past checkered like checkerboards in central park .
you do good in the light and the bad in the dark .
good men are scarce and few .
they 're always passing through .
oh , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
they 're all i see .
oh , let me be , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
oh mirrored sea , leave me be .
born with a chance that everybody takes , with all risk and hardly any reward .
bounce off the walls of your teens like in a pinball machine .
slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life like overheard insults or a cheating wife and then it 's down for the count , the lost that wo n't be found .
oh , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
they 're all i see .
oh , let me be , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
oh mirrored sea , leave me be .
everyone 's alone .
oh , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
they 're all i see .
oh , let me be , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
oh , mirrored sea , leave me be .
