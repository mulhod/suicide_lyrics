# the only time

i 'm drunk , and right now i 'm so in love with you .
and i do n't want to think too much about what we should or should n't do .
lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars , while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car .
nothing quite like the feel of something new .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
this is the only time i really feel alive .
this is the only time i really feel alive .
i swear , i just found everything i need .
the sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me .
well i want to drink it up and swim in it until i drown , my immoral standing is lying down .
nothing quite like the feel of something new .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
