#vessel

i let you put it in my mouth .
i let it get under my skin .
i let you pump it through my veins .
i let you take me from within .
they tell you what we can and cannot do .
same thing we 've heard a hundred times before .
when i put you inside of me , none of that matters anymore .
my god , can i go any faster ?
oh my god , i do n't think i can last here .
i am you , and you are me .
we will never be alone .
i have finally found my place in everything .
i have finally found my home .
i can leave all of this flesh behind .
i can see right through this whole facade .
i am becoming something else .
i am turning into god .
my god can i go any faster ?
oh my god , i do n't think i can last here .
