#one too many mornings

down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark .
as the night comes in falling , the dogs 'll lose their bark and the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind .
yes , i 'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind .
from the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade and i turn my head back to the room where my love and i have laid and i gaze back to the street , the sidewalk , and the sign and i 'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind .
it 's a restless , hungry feeling that do n't mean no one no good when everything i 'm saying you can say it just as good .
you 're right from your side .
i 'm right from mine .
we 're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind .
