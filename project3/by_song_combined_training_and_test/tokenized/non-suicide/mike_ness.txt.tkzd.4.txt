#bakersfield

take me down that line , going to tow that heavy load .
i ca n't seem to make it , make it on my own .
turn the lights down low now .
turn down our bed .
i ca n't seem to get you out of my head .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're so close yet so far , far away .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're a million miles away , yeah .
i feel the heat coming down now .
sweat runs down my face .
i can hardly make it go , make it through this day .
was it something that i said , or something i did n't do .
eighteen more hours , girl , 'til i 'm home to you .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're so close yet so far , far away .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're a million miles away , yeah .
so i walk out that lonely truck stop with my head hanging down wondering how in the hell i got myself into this mess , and more importantly how i was going to get myself out of it .
so i wrote a song for you , baby girl .
and i hope when i return home , the locks be not changed on the doors and there 's still a spot for me on that big ol ' california king size bed .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're so close yet so far , far away .
stranded here in bakersfield , you 're a million miles away , yeah .
wo n't you come see me in bakersfield ?
ooh , i 'm not a million miles away , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
