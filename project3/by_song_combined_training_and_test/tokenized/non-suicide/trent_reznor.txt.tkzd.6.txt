#suck

there is no god up in the sky tonight .
no sign of heaven anywhere in sight .
all that was true is left behind .
once i could see now i am blind .
do n't want your dreams you try to sell .
this disease i give to myself .
how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
she makes it sweeter than the sun .
i get too tight i come undone .
i bow my head to confess .
the temple walls are made of flesh .
runs up my arms 'til i 'm on track .
itches my skin right off of my back .
i 'll heal your wounds .
i 'll set you free .
i 'm jesus christ on ecstasy .
how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
i am so dirty on on the inside .
i am so dirty on on the inside .
i am so dirty on on the inside .
i am so dirty on on the inside .
how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
suck , suck , suck , suck .
a thousand lips , a thousand tongues , a thousand throats , a thousand lungs , a thousand ways to make it true i want to do terrible things to you .
