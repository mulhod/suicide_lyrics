#do n't drag me down

children are taught to hate .
parents just could n't wait .
some are rich and some are poor .
others will just suffer more .
have you ever been ashamed and felt society try to keep you down ?
i begin to watch things change and see them turn around .
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down .
turn around , turn around , do n't drag me down .
ignorance like a gun in hand .
reach out to the promised land .
your history books are full of lies .
media-blitz going to dry your eyes .
have you ever been afraid and felt society try to keep you down ?
i begin to watch things change and see them turn around .
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down .
turn around , turn around , do n't drag me down .
ignorance like a gun in hand .
reach out to the promised land .
your history books are full of lies .
media-blitz going to dry your eyes .
you 're eighteen , want to be a man .
your granddaddy 's in the ku klux klan , taking two steps forward and four steps back .
going to go to the white house and paint it black .
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down .
turn around , turn around , they 'll try to keep you down ,
turn around , do n't drag me down .
