#midnight ravers

you ca n't tell the woman from the man .
no , i say you ca n't because they 're dressed in the same pollution , dressed in the same pollution .
their mind is confused with confusion , with their problems since they 've no solution .
they become the midnight ravers .
someone say : please , do n't let me down !
oh , please , do n't let me , oh , please do n't let me down !
midnight ravers !
midnight ravers !
please do n't , oh , please , please , do n't let me down , down , down , down , down !
do n't let me down .
do n't let me down .
i see ten thousand chariots and they coming without horses , coming without horses .
the riders , they cover their face , so you could n't make them out in smoky place , make them out in smoky places , in that musical stampede , where everyone is doing their thing .
musical stampede , people swinging .
musical stampede , someone say :
people , ride on !
keep riding !

keep riding , midnight ravers !
