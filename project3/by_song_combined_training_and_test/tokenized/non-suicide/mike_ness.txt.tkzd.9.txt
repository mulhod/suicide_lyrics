#highway 101

take a drive baby up the coast , yea highway 101 .
i 'll pass ventura and santa barbara too , just as fast as my motor runs .
gotta pocket full of memories , some happy and some are sad .
gotta girl standing by my side through the good times and the bad .
listen to the boulevard , listen to the falling rain .
i believe in love now , with all of its joys and pains .
sick boy , sick girl , looking nice dressed up on a saturday night .
take a walk downtown for a while and chase the pale moonlight .
i can still hear the mission bells and the train rolling through your town .
going to leave this world behind , we 're southern california bound .
listen to the boulevard , listen to the falling rain .
i believe in love now , with all of its joys and pains .
listen to the boulevard , listen to the falling rain .
i believe in love now , with all of its joys and pains .
follow the palm trees under the california sun .
i believe in love now , i believe in love again .
