#cry like a ghost

all on my own , where i found you alone , you were caught up in somebody else 's mess and , yes , i drank all those drinks on my own .
my life 's become some blurry little quest .
and the clock kept ticking slowly , and you leaned over to ask me if i even had a clue where i was .
well , i lied down your wood floors , and my brain and body took course in the night and then , as though it never was .
it all began to feel the same .
i want to know where they keep the rain .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb ,
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough is enough .
sick to the bone on the steps to my home .
the moon shined through the drapery of leaves to her , to ignore everyone on my own , my true love , just to feel some made up breeze .
but , as my body crumbled , you walked as i just stumbled , and we spoke only of things made in my head .
you never once controlled me , what all the others told me that , if i kept on going , i 'd be dead .
it 's not just you who felt the pain .
now , tell me where they keep the rain .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb ,
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough is enough .
see what i 've done now .
i do n't understand
she says i screamed and that i raised my hand , but i never meant to .
was n't even there .
i never meant to .
i would never dare .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb ,
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough 's always too tough .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb .
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough is enough .
