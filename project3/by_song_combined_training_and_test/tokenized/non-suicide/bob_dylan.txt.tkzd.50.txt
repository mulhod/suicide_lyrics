#from a buick 6

i got this graveyard woman , you know , she keeps my kids .
but my soulful mama , you know , she keeps me hid .
she 's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread .
well , if i fall down dying , you know , she bound to put a blanket on my bed .
well , when the pipeline gets broken and i 'm lost on the river bridge , i 'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water 's edge , again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread .
well , if i fall down dying , you know , she bound to put a blanket on my bed .
well , she do n't make me nervous .
she do n't talk too much .
she walks like bo diddley and she do n't need no crutch .
she keeps this .410 all loaded with lead .
well , if i fall down dying , you know , she bound to put a blanket on my bed .
come on !
well , you know , i need a steam-shovel , mama , to keep away the dead .
i need a dump-truck , baby , to unload my head .
she brings me everything and more and just like i said , well , if i fall down dying , you know , she bound to put a blanket on my bed .
