# a mistake

i 'm going to make a mistake .
i 'm going to do it on purpose .
i 'm going to waste my time .
because i 'm full as a tick , and i 'm scratching at the surface .
and what i find is mine .
and when the day is done , and i look back , and the fact is i had fun , fumbling around .
all the advice i shunned , and i ran where they told me not to run , but i sure had fun , so i 'm going to fuck it up again .
i 'm going to do another detour .
unpave my path .
and if you want to make sense , what you looking at me for ?
i 'm no good at math .
and when i find my way back , the fact is i just may stay , or i may not .
i 've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake .
i want to make mistake ; why ca n't i make a mistake ?
i 'm always doing what i think i should .
almost always doing everybody good .
why ?
do i want to do right ?
of course , but do i really want to feel i 'm forced to answer you ?
hell no .
i 've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake .
i want to make a mistake .
why ca n't i make a mistake ?
i 'm always doing what i think i should .
almost always doing everybody good .
why ?
