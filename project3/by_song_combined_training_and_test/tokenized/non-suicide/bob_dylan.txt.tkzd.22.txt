#absolutely sweet marie

well , your railroad gate , you know i just ca n't jump it .
sometimes it gets so hard to see .
i 'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet with all these promises you left for me .
but where are you tonight , sweet marie ?
well , i waited for you when i was half sick .
yes , i waited for you when you hated me .
well , i waited for you inside of the frozen traffic when you knew i had some other place to be .
now , where are you tonight , sweet marie ?
well , anybody can be just like me , obviously , but then now again not too many can be like you , fortunately .
well , six white horses that you did promise were finally delivered down to the penitentiary .
but to live outside the law you must be honest .
i know you always say that you agree .
alright , so , where are you tonight , sweet marie ?
well , i do n't know how it happened , but the riverboat captain , he knows my fate .
but everybody else , even yourself , they 're just going to have to wait .
well , i got the fever down in my pockets .
the persian drunkard , he follows me .
yes , i can take him to your house , but i ca n't unlock it .
you see , you forgot to leave me with the key .
oh , where are you tonight , sweet marie ?
well , i been in jail where all the mail showed that a man ca n't give his address out to bad company .
and now i stand here looking at your yellow railroad in the ruins of your balcony , wondering where you are tonight , sweet marie .
