#fight at the table

had a fight at the table .
i did n't think it would end .
i did n't think i 'd be able to go on and pretend .
i been having a good time .
i did n't want you to go , she said .
got to leave her alone .
i started dreaming about emma , and he said , "do n't interfere . "
said "what are you doing in denver ?
there no light in here " .
well , i been having a good time .
i did n't want you to go .
why ca n't they stop all this jiving ?
you do n't want to know .
it must be getting past midnight , and now i 'm staring to scream .
she really put up a good fight .
i think this must be a dream .
i been having a good time .
babe , i 'm lost in the rain .
i told them just when i 'm going .
i think i 'm going insane .
