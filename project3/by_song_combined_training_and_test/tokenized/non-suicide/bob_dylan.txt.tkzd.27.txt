#simple twist of fate

they sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark .
she looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones .
'twas then he felt alone and wished that he 'd gone straight and watched out for a simple twist of fate .
they walked along by the old canal , a little confused - i remember well - and stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright .
he felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train , moving with a simple twist of fate .
a saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade , as the light burst through a beat-up shade , where he was waking up .
she dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate and forgot about a simple twist of fate .
he woke up .
the room was bare .
he did n't see her anywhere .
he told himself he did n't care , pushed the window open wide , felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate , brought on by a simple twist of fate .
he hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks , hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in .
maybe she 'll pick him out again .
how long must he wait one more time for a simple twist of fate ?
people tell me it 's a sin to know and feel too much within .
i still believe she was my twin , but i lost the ring .
she was born in spring , but i was born too late .
blame it on a simple twist of fate .
