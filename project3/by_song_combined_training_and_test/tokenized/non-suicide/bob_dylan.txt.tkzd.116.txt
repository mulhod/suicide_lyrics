# with god on our side

oh , my name , it be not nothing .
my age , it means less .
the country i come from is called the midwest .
i 's taught and brought up there the laws to abide and that the land that i live in has god on its side .
oh , the history books tell it .
they tell it so well .
the cavalries charged .
the indians fell .
the cavalries charged .
the indians died .
oh , the country was young with god on its side .
the spanish-american war had its day and the civil war , too , was soon laid away and the names of the heroes i 's made to memorize with guns in their hands and god on their side .
the first world war , boys , it came and it went .
the reason for fighting i never did get , but i learned to accept it , accept it with pride for you do n't count the dead when god 's on your side .
the second world war came to an end .
we forgave the germans and then we were friends .
though they murdered six million , in the ovens they fried , the germans now , too , have god on their side .
i 've learned to hate the russians all through my whole life .
if another war comes it 's them we must fight , to hate them and fear them , to run and to hide , and accept it all bravely with god on my side .
but now we got weapons of chemical dust .
if fire them we 're forced to , then fire them we must .
one push of the button and a shot the world wide and you never ask questions when god 's on your side .
through many a dark hour i 've been thinking about this , that jesus christ was betrayed by a kiss , but i ca n't think for you .
you 'll have to decide whether judas iscariot had god on his side .
so now , as i 'm leaving , i 'm weary as hell .
the confusion i 'm feeling be not no tongue can tell .
the words fill my head and fall to the floor , that , if god 's on our side , he 'll stop the next war .
