#i do not want this

i 'm losing ground .
you know how this world can beat you down .
i 'm made of clay .
i fear i 'm the only one who thinks this way .
i 'm always falling down the same hill .
bamboo puncturing this skin and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall i 'm drowning in .
two feet below the surface i can still make out your wavy face .
if i could just reach you maybe i could leave this place .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
you do n't know just how i feel .
i stay inside my bed .
i have lived so many lives all in my head .
do n't tell me that you care .
there really is n't anything now , is there ?
you would know , would n't you ?
you extend your hand to those who suffer , to those who know what it really feels like , to those who 've had a taste like that means something .
and oh so sick i am .
and maybe i do n't have a choice .
and maybe that is all i have .
and maybe this is a cry for help .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
you do n't know just how i feel .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
