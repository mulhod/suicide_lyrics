# the warning

some say it was a warning .
some say it 's a sign .
i was standing right there when it came down from the sky .
the way it spoke to us , you felt it from inside .
said it was up to us , up to us to decide .
"you 've become a virus , killing off his host .
we been watching you with all our eyes and what you seem to value most .
so much potential , or so we used to say .
your greed , self-importance , and your arrogance , you piss it all away .
we heard her cry .
we have come to intervene .
you will change your ways and you will make amends , or we will wipe this place clean ! "
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away , ticking away .
