#on the road again

well , i wake up in the morning , there 's frogs inside my socks .
your mama , she 's hiding inside the icebox .
your daddy walks in wearing a napoleon bonaparte mask .
and you ask why i do n't live here .
honey , do you have to ask ?
well , i go to pet your monkey , i get a face full of claws .
i said , "who 's in the fireplace ? " and you tell me , " santa claus . "
the milkman comes in , he 's wearing a derby hat .
and you ask why i do n't live here .
honey , how come you have to ask me that ?
well , i asked for something to eat , i 'm hungry as a hog , so i get brown rice , seaweed , and a dirty hot dog .
i 've got a hole where my stomach disappeared .
then you ask why i do n't live here .
honey , i got to think you 're really weird .
your grandpa 's cane , it turns into a sword .
your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board .
everything inside my pockets your uncle steals .
and you ask why i do n't live here .
honey , i ca n't believe that you 're for real .
well , there 's fistfights in the kitchen .
they 're enough to make me cry .
then the mailman comes in .
even he 's got to take a side ,
even the butler , he 's got something to prove .
and you ask why i do n't live here .
honey , how come you do n't move ?
