#nobody told me

everybody 's talking , and no one says a word .
everybody 's making love , and no one really cares .
there 's nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs .
always something happening and nothing going on .
there 's always something cooking and nothing in the pot .
they 're starving back in china , so finish what you got .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
strange days indeed , strange days indeed .
everybody 's running , and no one makes a move .
everyone 's a winner , and nothing left to lose .
there 's a little yellow idol to the north of kathmandu .
everybody 's flying , and no one leaves the ground .
everybody 's crying , and no one makes a sound .
there 's a place for us in the movies you just got to lay around .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
strange days indeed , most peculiar , mama .
everybody 's smoking , and no one 's getting high .
everybody 's flying , and never touch the sky .
there 's a ufo over new york , and i ai n't too surprised .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
nobody told me there 'd be days like these .
strange days indeed , most peculiar , mama .
