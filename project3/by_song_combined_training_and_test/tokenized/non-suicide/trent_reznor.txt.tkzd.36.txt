#me , i 'm not

well it 's happening .
never planned on this .
you 've got something i need , kind of dangerous .
and i 'm losing control .
i 'm not used to this .
what you want from me .
i 'm not used to this .
i ca n't shut it off this thing i 've begun .
and it 's hard to tell just where it 's coming from .
and it 's hard to see what i 'm capable of .
and it 's hard to believe just what i 've become .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not
i can swallow it down , keep it all inside .
i define myself by how well i hide .
i feel it coming apart .
well , at least i tried .
i can win this war by knowing not to fight .
if i take it all back , someway , somehow .
if i knew back then what i know right now .
hey can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
