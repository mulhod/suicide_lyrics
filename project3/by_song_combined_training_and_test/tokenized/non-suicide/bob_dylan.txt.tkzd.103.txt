#masters of war

come , you masters of war , you that build the big guns , you that build the death-planes , you that build all the bombs , you that hide behind walls , you that hide behind desks .
i just want you to know i can see through your masks .
you that never done nothing but build to destroy , you play with my world like it 's your little toy .
you put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes and you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly .
like judas of old , you lie and deceive .
a world war can be won you want me to believe .
but i see through your eyes and i see through your brain like i see through the water that runs down my drain .
you fasten all the triggers for the others to fire .
then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher and you hide in your mansion while the young people 's blood flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud .
you 've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled , fear to bring children into the world .
for threatening my baby , unborn and unnamed , you be not worth the blood that runs in your veins .
how much do i know to talk out of turn ?
you might say that i 'm young .
you might say i 'm unlearned .
but there 's one thing i know though i 'm younger than you . that even jesus would never forgive what you do .
let me ask you one question .
is your money that good ?
will it buy you forgiveness ?
do you think that it could ?
i think you will find , when your death takes its toll , all the money you made will never buy back your soul .
and i hope that you die .
and your death will come soon .
i 'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon and i 'll watch while you 're lowered down to your deathbed and i 'll stand over your grave till i 'm sure that you 're dead .
