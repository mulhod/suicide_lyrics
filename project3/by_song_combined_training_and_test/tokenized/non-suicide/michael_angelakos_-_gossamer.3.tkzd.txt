#carried away

since my heart is golden , i 've got sense to hold in .
tempted just to make an ugly scene .
no , i 'm not as proper .
my money 's in copper .
ripped down from the brownstones to the street .
listen , i 'm your friend , do n't quote me , but not a friend worth noting .
yes , please do n't ever note me as your friend .
who says we have cold hearts acting out our old parts ?
dance before my favorite little scene , oh , oh , oh , oh .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
all your appeal , once again we 'd feel higher education making sense .
justify your thesis , certain that you need this .
tell me what your point is in defense .
listen , i do n't really know you , and i do n't think i want to , but i think i can fake it if you can .
let 's agree there 's no need , no more talk of money .
let 's just keep pretending to be friends , oh , oh , oh .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
wake up in the morning .
wake up in the evening .
wake up when you want to because no one 's really watching .
wish you had something to say about it , but we all have problems .
we 're all having problems and we all got something to say .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
