# the reeling

we dug these holes we crawled into .
now they 're my home .
now here i cannot feel the wind , ca n't feel the rain , oh , no , and i believe in gentle harmony .
well , how i loathe all this obscenity .
is this the way my life has got to be ?
have i a single opportunity ?
look at me , oh , look at me .
is this the way i 'll always be ?
oh , no , oh , no .
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me .
oh , no , oh , no .
every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day .
oh , no , oh , no .
here i am , oh , here i am .
oh , when will someone understand ?
oh , no , oh , no .
and all at once i feel this .
oh , how it clings to me .
it reels and calls me towards it , confounding destiny .
and i can feel the madness inch by inch .
the more i run the more i am convinced .
a color all these like the branches glimpse just like the saddle in the foggy mist .
look at me , oh , look at me .
is this the way i 'll always be ?
oh , no , oh , no .
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me .
oh , no , oh , no .
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day .
oh , no , oh , no .
here i am , oh , here i am .
oh , when will someone understand ?
oh , no , oh , no .
look at me , oh , look at me .
is this the way i 'll always be ?
oh ,no , oh , no .
now i pray that somebody will quickly come and kidnap me .
oh , no , oh , no .
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day .
oh , no , oh , no .
here i am , oh , here i am .
oh , when will someone understand ?
oh , no , oh , no .
