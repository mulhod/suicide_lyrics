#i do n't know

whatever it is you 're thinking , sit down and let 's give it a try .
you know that i 'll always listen , but sometimes i 'm wondering why .
you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
baby i 'm feeling lost .
i do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
once in a while you 're lonely .
tell me you needed a friend .
i 'm wondering what is the matter , but you say that you ca n't explain .
but you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
but , baby , i 'm feeling lost .
i do n't know what i 'm going through .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
do you want me ?
i want you .
you do n't want me ?
i want you .
do n't you know i 'm losing sleep at night , sleep at night .
i do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
whatever it is you 're thinking , sit down and let 's give it a try .
you know that i 'll always listen , but sometimes i 'm wondering why .
you do n't lie to me , and i would n't lie to you , oh , no .
but , baby , i 'm feeling lost .
i do n't know what i 'm going to do .
you do n't know what you 're putting me through .
i got to get away from you .
