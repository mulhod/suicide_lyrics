# when she begins

i was feeling kinda beat , i decided to hit the streets .
i was looking for a place for this heart of mine .
well i said to myself , oh god this must be hell .
i think i was slowly losing my mind .
well round and round she goes where she 'll stop nobody knows .
y 'know that woman put a spell on me .
but if you start me , start me , start me , you ca n't stop me , stop me , stop me .
when she begins to rock , honey , i begin to roll .
i was hanging by the phone , tired of sleeping alone .
baby tell me where did i go wrong ?
when minutes seem like hours and days seem like weeks , how could a year last so fucking long ?
well round and round she goes where she 'll stop nobody knows .
y 'know that woman put a spell on me .
but if you start me , start me , start me , you ca n't stop me , stop me , stop me .
when she begins to rock , honey , i begin to roll .
i was hanging with a couple of chicks , man i was just looking for kicks .
i was looking for a place for this raggedy ol ' heart of mine .
well i said to myself , oh god this must be hell .
i think i was slowly losing my mind .
well round and round she goes where she 'll stop nobody knows .
y 'know that woman put a spell on me .
but if you start me , start me , start me , you ca n't stop me , stop me , stop me .
when she begins to rock , honey , i begin to roll .
