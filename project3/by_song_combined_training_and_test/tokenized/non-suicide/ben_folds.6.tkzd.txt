#trusted

it 's funny , i know , but i 'm disappointed in you .
i thought you could read my mind but i came home early and saw that a drawer had been opened .
looks like you 've been reading my diary instead .
how does it feel to realize you 're all alone behind your eyes ?
it seems to me if you ca n't trust , you ca n't be trusted .
caught in a dream , picking up astral signals , some of them psychic .
you better watch what you think .
happens to be that everybody else 's dreams are freudian clues .
you better watch what you dream .
you want to see the other side , what 's going on behind the eyes .
still it seems if you ca n't trust , you ca n't be trusted .
did n't you know we 're as close as we can be ?
the sun 's coming up .
she 's pulled all the blankets over , curled in a ball like she 's hiding from me .
and that 's when i know she 's going to be pissed when she wakes up for terrible things i did to her in her dreams .
you want to see the other side , what 's going on behind the eyes .
still it seems if you ca n't trust , you ca n't be trusted .
did n't you know we 're as close as we can be ?
hello .
