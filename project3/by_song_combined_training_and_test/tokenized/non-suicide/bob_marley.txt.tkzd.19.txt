#small axe

why boasteth thyself , oh , evil men ?
playing smart and not being clever , oh , no!
i say you 're working iniquity to achieve vanity , yeah , if a-so a-so .
but the goodness of jah , jah , endureth for ever .
if you are the big tree , we are the small axe sharpened to cut you down , ready to cut you down , oh , yeah !
these are the words of my master .
keep on telling me , oh , oh , no weak heart shall prosper .
oh , no , they ca n't , eh !
and whosoever diggeth a pit , lord , shall fall in it , shall fall in it .
whosoever diggeth a pit shall bury in it , shall bury in it .
if you are the big tree , we are the small axe sharpened to cut you down , ready to cut you down .
whosoever diggeth the pit shall fall in it , fall in it , eh !
whosoever diggeth the pit shall bury in it , shall bury in it .
if you are the big tree , we have a small axe ready to cut you down , sharpened to cut you down .
if you are the big tree , let me tell you this : we are the small axe ready to cut you down , sharpened to cut you down .
if you have a big tree , we are the small axe .
