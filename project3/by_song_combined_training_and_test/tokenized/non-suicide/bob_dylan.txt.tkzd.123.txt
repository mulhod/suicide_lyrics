#restless farewell

oh , all the money that in my whole life i did spend , be it mine right or wrongfully , i let it slip gladly to my friends to tie up the time most forcefully .
but the bottles are done , we 've killed each one , and the table 's full and overflowed , and the corner sign says it 's closing time , so i 'll bid farewell and be down the road .
oh , every girl that ever i 've touched , i did not do it harmfully and every girl that ever i 've hurt , i did not do it knowingly .
but to remain as friends you need the time to make amends and stay behind and , since my feet are now fast and point away from the past , i 'll bid farewell and be down the line .
oh , every foe that ever i faced , the cause was there before we came and every cause that ever i fought , i fought it full without regret or shame .
but the dark does die as the curtain is drawn and somebody 's eyes must meet the dawn and , if i see the day , i 'd only have to stay , so i 'll bid farewell in the night and be gone .
oh , every thought that 's strung a knot in my mind , i might go insane if it could n't be sprung , but it 's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes , it 's for myself and my friends my stories are sung .
but the time be not tall , yet on time you depend , and no word is possessed by no special friend and , though the line is cut , it be not quite the end .
i 'll just bid farewell till we meet again .
oh , a false clock tries to tick out my time , to disgrace , distract , and bother me and the dirt of gossip blows into my face and the dust of rumors covers me .
but , if the arrow is straight and the point is slick , it can pierce through dust no matter how thick , so i 'll make my stand and remain as i am and bid farewell and not give a damn .
