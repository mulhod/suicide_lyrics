#ruiner

you had all of them on your side , did n't you ?
you believe in all your lies , did n't you ?
the ruiner 's got a lot to prove .
he 's got nothing to lose , and now he made you believe .
the ruiner 's your only friend .
well he 's the living end to the cattle he deceives .
the raping of the innocent ; you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees .
now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease .
how 'd you get so big ?
how 'd you get so strong ?
how 'd you get so hard ?
how 'd you get so long ?
you had to give them all a sign , did n't you ?
you had to covet what was mine , did n't you ?
the ruiner 's a collector .
he 's an infector , serving his shit to his flies .
maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize .
maybe it 's a part of me you took to a place i hoped it would never go .
and maybe that fucked me up so much more than you 'll ever know .
how 'd you get so big ?
how 'd you get so strong ?
how 'd you get so hard ?
how 'd you get so long ?
what you gave to me , my perfect ring of scars .
you know i can see what you really are .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop me now .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop me now .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop me now .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop .
