#revolution

revelation reveals the truth , revelation .
revolution , revolution , revolution .
it takes a revolution to make a solution .
too much confusion , so much frustration , eh !
i do n't want to live in the park .
ca n't trust no shadows after dark , yeah-eh !
so , my friend , i wish that you could see , like a bird in the tree , the prisoners must be free , yeah !
never make a politician grant you a favour .
they will always want to control you forever , eh !
so if a fire make it burn , make it burn , make it burn , and if a blood make you run , make you run , run , run , rasta de 'pon top .
ca n't you see ?
so you ca n't predict the flop , eh , eh !
we got lightning , thunder , brimstone , and fire , fire , fire , fire .
lightning , thunder , brimstone and fire , fire , fire , fire !
kill , cramp , and paralyze all weak at conception .
wipe them out of creation , yeah !
oh ! let i'es is i'es , in i'es is black ,
in i'es is red , in i'es is dread .
let righteousness cover the earth .
like the water cover the sea , yeah , yeah !
lightning , thunder , brimstone , fire , fire .
a lightning , thunder , brimstone , and fire .
