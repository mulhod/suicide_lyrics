#there was a light

there was a light so dear to me i wanted to live .
there was a time so near to me i asked you to give your life to me .
if it 's a sign sent down to me , i 'm asking you why it had to be .
spending all my time , waiting to die - what 's the use ?
there was a light so dear to me i wanted to live .
there was a time so dear to me i asked you to give your life to me .
