#gates of eden

of war and peace the truth just twists .
its curfew-gull , it glides upon four-legged forest-clouds .
the cowboy angel rides with his candle lit into the sun though its glow is waxed in black , all except when beneath the trees of eden .
the lamppost stands with folded arms , its iron claws attached to curbs beneath holes where babies wail though its shadow 's metal badge all and all can only fall with a crashing , but meaningless blow .
no sound ever comes from the gates of eden .
the savage soldier sticks his head in sand and then complains unto the shoeless hunter who 's gone deaf , but still remains upon the beach , where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails , heading for the gates of eden .
with a time-rusted compass blade , aladdin and his lamp sits with utopian hermit-monks side-saddle on the golden calf and on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh , all except inside the gates of eden .
relationships of ownership , they whisper in the wings to those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings and i try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings .
there are no kings inside the gates of eden .
the motorcycle black madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver-studded phantom cause the gray-flannel dwarf to scream as he weeps to wicked birds of prey , who pick up on his breadcrumb sins and there are no sins inside the gates of eden .
the kingdoms of experience , in the precious winds they rot while paupers change possessions , each one wishing for what the other has got .
and the princess and the prince discuss what 's real and what is not .
it does n't matter inside the gates of eden .
the foreign sun , it squints upon a bed that is never mine as friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign , leaving men wholly , totally free to do anything they wish to do , but die and there are no trials inside the gates of eden .
at dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams with no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means .
at times i think there are no words but these to tell what 's true and there are no truths outside the gates of eden .
