#it takes a lot to laugh , it takes a train to cry

well , i ride on a mail-train , baby , ca n't buy a thrill .
well , i 've been up all night , leaning on the windowsill .
well , if i die on top of the hill and if i do n't make it , you know my baby will .
do n't the moon look good , mama , shining through the trees ?
do n't the brakeman look good , mama , flagging down the double e ?
do n't the sun look good going down over the sea ?
but do n't my gal look fine when she 's coming after me ?
now , the wintertime is coming .
the windows are filled with frost .
i went to tell everybody , but i could not get across .
well , i want to be your lover , baby .
i do n't want to be your boss .
do n't say i never warned you when your train gets lost .
