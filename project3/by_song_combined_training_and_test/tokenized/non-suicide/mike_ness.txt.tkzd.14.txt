#winners and losers

winners and losers , turn the pages of my life .
we 're beggars and choosers , with all the struggles and the strife .
i got no reason to turn my head and look the other way .
we 're good and we 're evil .
which one will i be today ?
there 's saints and sinners .
life 's a gamble and you might lose .
there 's cowards and heroes , both have been known now to break the rules .
there 's lovers and haters .
the strong and the weak will all have their day .
we 're devils and angels .
which one will i be today ?
are you happy now with all the choices you 've made ?
are there times in life when you know you should have stayed ?
will you compromise then realize the price is too much to pay ?
winners and losers , which one will you be today ?
there 's a light and a dark side .
standing at the crossroads , there we 'll meet .
there 's prophets and fools there .
the lies and the truth , will be at our feet .
i got a reason to turn my head and look the other way .
it 's heaven and hell here .
which one will i live today ?
are you happy now with all the choices you 've made ?
are there times in life when you know you should have stayed ?
did you compromise then realize the price was too much to pay ?
winners and losers , which one will you be today ?
which one will you be today ?
which one will i be today ?
