# the first taste

i lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts waiting for the black to replace my blue .
i do not struggle in your web because it was my aim to get caught .
but daddy longlegs , i feel that i 'm finally growing weary of waiting to be consumed by you .
give me the first taste .
let it begin .
heaven cannot wait forever .
darling , just start the chase .
i 'll let you win , but you must make the endeavour .
oh , your love gives me a heart confusion .
adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red .
your hungry flirt borders intrusion .
i 'm building memories on things we have not said .
full is not heavy as empty , not nearly my love , not nearly my love , not nearly .
give me the first taste .
let it begin .
heaven cannot wait forever .
darling , just start the chase .
i 'll let you win , but you must make the endeavour .
