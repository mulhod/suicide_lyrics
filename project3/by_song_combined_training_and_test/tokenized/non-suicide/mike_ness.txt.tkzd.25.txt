# a place in my heart

i saw her today , oh god i miss her smile .
a pleasant memory of things in life worthwhile , the things worthwhile .
we used to walk , and we used to talk .
we used to laugh , and we used to cry .
and there will always be a place in my heart for her .
i thought of her today , of years together spent .
a pleasant memory of places that we went , the places we went .
we used to walk , and we used to talk .
we used to laugh , and we used to cry .
and there will always be a place in my heart for her .
