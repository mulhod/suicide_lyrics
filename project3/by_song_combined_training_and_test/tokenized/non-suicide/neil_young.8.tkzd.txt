#from hank to hendrix

from hank to hendrix i walked these streets with you .
here i am with this old guitar , doing what i do .
i always expected that you would see me through .
i never believed in much , but i believed in you .
can we get it together ?
can we still stand side by side ?
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?
from marilyn to madonna i always loved your smile .
now we 're headed for the big divorce , california-style .
i found myself singing like a long-lost friend .
the same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end .
can we get it together ?
can we still stand side by side ?
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?
sometime it 's distorted , not clear to you
sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringing through .
new glass in the window , new leaf on the tree , new distance between us , you and me .
can we get it together ?
can we still walk side by side ?
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?
