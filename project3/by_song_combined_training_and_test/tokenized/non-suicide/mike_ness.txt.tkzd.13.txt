#i was n't born to follow

when i grow up , going to be a star .
going to sing my songs and play my guitar , i 'm ready .
going to change the world , going to turn the page , going to say what i feel , let out this rage , get ready .
we 're going down , down to the streets below .
going to sing the songs of the streets again .
going to knock me off my feet , so get ready .
i 'll sing a song for the fallen angels .
this one goes to all the unsung heroes .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause do n't you know , i was n't born to follow .
i realize that in your eyes you got ideas but i got mine , get ready .
here comes the new generation .
hope they feel and fight the same way as we did .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause i was n't born , i was n't born to follow , no .
when i grow up , going to be a star .
going to sing my songs and play my guitar , i 'm ready .
going to change the world , going to turn the page , going to say what i feel , let out this rage , get ready .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause do n't you know , i was n't born to follow .
we 're going down , down to the streets below , cause do n't you know , i was n't born to follow .
we 're going down , down , down , down .
we 're going down , down , down , down .
i said goodbye to the masses .
i was n't born to follow .
