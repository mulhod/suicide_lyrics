#god given

hey man , please do n't make a sound .
take a look around .
ca n't you see what 's right in front of you ?
ah , have a little taste .
no more time to waste .
you do n't want to get left behind cause it 's all coming down right now .
how hard is it to see ?
put your faith in me .
i sure would n't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood .
you should get where you belong .
everything you know is wrong .
come on , sing along , everybody now .
god given !
and he gives us sight , and we see the light , and it burns so bright .
now we know we 're right .
when his kingdom come , and thy will be done , we have just begun .
we 're the chosen ones .
i would never tell you anything that was n't absolutely true that had n't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you .
wait , step into the light .
how can this be right ?
i 'm afraid we 're going to ask you to leave .
guess you can not win , with the color of your skin .
you wo n't be getting in to the promised land .
besides this is just another case , you people still do n't know your place .
step aside , out the way , wipe that look off your face .
we are the devine .
separated from the swine .
come on , sing along , everybody now .
god given !
and he gives us sight , and we see the light , and it burns so bright .
now we know we 're right .
when his kingdom come , and thy will be done , we have just begun .
we 're the chosen ones .
and he gives us sight .
and we see the light .
and it burns so bright .
now we know we 're right .
when his kingdom come , and thy will be done , and the father and the holy son , we 're the chosen ones .
i would never tell you anything that was n't absolutely true that had n't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you .
