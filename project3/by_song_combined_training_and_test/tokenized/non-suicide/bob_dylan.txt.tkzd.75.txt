#if not for you

if not for you , babe , i could n't find the door , could n't even see the floor .
i 'd be sad and blue if not for you .
if not for you , babe , i 'd lay awake all night , wait for the morning light to shine in through .
but it would not be new if not for you .
if not for you , my sky would fall , rain would gather , too .
without your love i 'd be nowhere at all .
i 'd be lost if not for you and you know it 's true .
if not for you , my sky would fall , rain would gather , too .
without your love i 'd be nowhere at all .
oh , what would i do if not for you ?
if not for you winter would have no spring , i could n't hear the robin sing , i just would n't have a clue .
anyway , it would n't ring true if not for you , if not for you , if not for you , if not for you , if not for you .
