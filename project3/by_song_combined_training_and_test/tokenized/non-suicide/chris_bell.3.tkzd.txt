#speed of sound

i remember the first time you said you loved me .
i waited all weekend .
you never called me .
so you find him attractive .
so what if he is ?
you 'd like some excitement .
you could count his same kiss .
so it goes on and on .
my love grows and yours is gone .
a lonely existence , well it 's just a lie .
if there is a reason , i 'd like to know why .
something i want you to know : i 've told you this once before , do n't want you to see him no more .
once again you 've let me down , broke my heart , and turned me around .
there 's a light in the darkness .
it does n't seem far .
is something the matter that 's brought us ajar ?
the plane goes down , will not land .
pilot 's dead .
nowhere to be found .
