#dear lover

yeah , loving over and over again now .
it be not nothing girl till you 've felt the pain .
up against the wall .
why does love always have to hurt ?
your scratches run across my back and then a tear .
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more .
dear lover , i pick my heart up from the floor .
dear lover , i ca n't believe it 's come to this .
dear lover , give me one last painful kiss .
there be not nothing in this world for free now .
so how high of a price will you pay ?
hear the screams so loud , wake up to the broken glass .
it 's a scene from bad to worse and many more tears .
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more .
dear lover , i pick my heart up from the floor .
dear lover , i ca n't believe it 's come to this .
dear lover , give me one last painful kiss .
dear lover , i ca n't take the pain no more .
dear lover , i pick my heart up from the floor .
dear lover , i ca n't believe it 's come to this .
dear lover , give me one last painful kiss .
one last kiss , one last kiss , one last kiss .
