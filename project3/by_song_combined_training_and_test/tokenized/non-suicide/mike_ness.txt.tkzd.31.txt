#99 to life

i 'm broken hearted , i 'm a broken man .
driven by anger , on that night i ran .
i had me a woman .
i thought that she 'd be true .
now she 's gone and left me , you know her life is through .
lonely weekends , baby lonely nights .
the judge he gave me , ninety nine to life .
i wish she could be here , lord if she only could .
instead she 's laying in a puddle of blood .
she was my baby , thought she 'd be my wife .
i killed my baby , i killed her with my knife .
lonely weekends , baby lonely nights .
the judge he gave me , ninety nine to life .
so alone i 'm sitting in my prison cell lord only knows now , i 'm in a living hell .
the rest of my life , in this penitentiary , the good lord above now , please have mercy on me .
lonely weekends , baby lonely nights .
the judge he gave me , ninety nine to life .
