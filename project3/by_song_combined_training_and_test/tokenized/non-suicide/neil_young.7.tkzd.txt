#unknown legend

she used to work in a diner .
never saw a woman look finer .
i used to order just to watch her float across the floor .
she grew up in a small town , never put her roots down .
daddy always kept moving , so she did too .
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley-davidson , her long blonde hair flying in the wind .
she 's been running half her life , the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes , the air she breathes .
you know it ai n't easy .
you got to hold on .
she was an unknown legend in her time .
now she 's dressing two kids , looking for a magic kiss .
she gets the far-away look in her eyes .
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley-davidson , her long blonde hair flying in the wind .
she 's been running half her life , the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes , the air she breathes .
