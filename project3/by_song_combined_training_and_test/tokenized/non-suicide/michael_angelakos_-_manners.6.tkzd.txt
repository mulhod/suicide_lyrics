#swimming in the flood

my eyes have once again been proven wrong .
your clouds , your blanket , and my pity song , hovering on your front lawn , carry on until it 's gone .
what can i do ?
the river 's overrun .
we 're swimming in a flood , you know ?
i thought i felt your touch , but the water 's rising up .
then i lie naked in a rampage in the flesh , face to face with the onset .
i forget everything that 's ever made me .
rise again .
now slowly leave my memory .
what can i do ?
the river 's overrun .
we 're swimming in a flood , you know ?
i thought i felt your touch , but the water 's rising up .
now all my lovers raise their cups .
what can i do ?
the river 's overrun .
we 're swimming in a flood , you know ?
i thought i felt your touch , but the water 's rising up .
now all my lovers raise their cups .
