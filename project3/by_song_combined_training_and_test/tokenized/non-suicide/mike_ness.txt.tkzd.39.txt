#gotta know the rules

spent my whole life yeah looking for something .
what it was , i 'm not really sure .
i looked for happiness , but only found sorrow .
then i realized how to unlock the door yeah , yeah , yeah .
so you think you 've got it figured out ?
it do n't come easy , maybe just for fools .
some say life is a struggle now .
it 's a game now , just got to know the rules .
gotta know the rules .
most people go through life thinking :
take what you can and leave the weak behind .
never stop to think what can you give now .
too afraid to learn what you might find yeah , yeah , yeah
so you think you 've got it figured out ?
it do n't come easy , maybe just for fools .
some say life is a struggle now .
it 's a game now , just got to know the rules .
gotta know the rules .
spent my whole life yeah doing things my way .
doing unto others , knowing its wrong .
when 's the last time you looked in the mirror ?
when 's the last time you liked what you saw , yeah , yeah , yeah ?
so you think you 've got it figured out ?
it do n't come easy , maybe just for fools .
some say life is a struggle now .
it 's a game now , just got to know the rules .
gotta know the rules .
