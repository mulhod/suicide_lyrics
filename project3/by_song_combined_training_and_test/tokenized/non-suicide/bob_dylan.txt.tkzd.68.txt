#i threw it all away

i once held her in my arms .
she said she would always stay .
but i was cruel .
i treated her like a fool .
i threw it all away .
once i had mountains in the palm of my hand and rivers that ran through every day .
i must 've been mad .
i never knew what i had until i threw it all away .
love is all there is .
it makes the world go around , love and only love .
it ca n't be denied .
no matter what you think about it , you just wo n't be able to do without it .
take a tip from one who 's tried .
so , if you find someone who gives you all of her love , take it to your heart .
do n't let it stray for one thing for certain , you will surely be hurting if you throw it all away .
