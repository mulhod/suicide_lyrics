#nickels and dimes

i 'm a cadillac tramp at the end of his road .
a swap meet rat who 's sitting on gold , yeah baby .
i 'm a guitar gangster without a tune .
i 'm the baseball bat that 's waiting to swing .
your loan shark friend with the broken knees , yeah baby .
i 'm a penthouse pauper with nothing to lose .
yeah , yeah , yeah , i 'm chasing nickles and dimes .
the rest of the world passes me by .
nah , nah , nah , im just wasting my time .
i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
i 'm the high rolling creep that 's in too deep with the slicked back hair and the silver teeth , yeah baby .
i 'm a vagabond king with a stolen crown .
i 'm a jailhouse poet , a genius , a fool , i 'm the pimp who lost his cool , yeah baby .
i 've got first class taste in a second class town .
yeah , yeah , yeah , i 'm chasing nickles and dimes .
the rest of the world passes me by .
nah , nah , nah , im just wasting my time .
i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
yeah .
i 'm a loaded gun that pointed at the mirror .
a drugstore cowboy whose end is near , yeah baby .
i 'm a big time schemer with broken down dreams .
i 'm a derelict rebel without a cause .
i be not the cat with the sharpest claws , no baby .
cause sometimes life just be not what it seems .
yeah , yeah , yeah , i 'm chasing nickles and dimes .
the rest of the world passes me by .
nah , nah , nah , im just wasting my time .
i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
i 'm just sitting here and wondering why .
and just like you , i 'm wondering why .
