#i am a lonesome hobo

i am a lonesome hobo without family or friends .
where another man 's life might begin , that 's exactly where mine ends .
i have tried my hand at bribery , blackmail , and deceit and i 've served time for everything except begging on the street .
well , once i was rather prosperous .
there was nothing i did lack .
i had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back , but i did not trust my brother .
i carried him to blame , which led me to my fatal doom , to wander off in shame .
kind ladies and kind gentlemen , soon i will be gone , but let me just warn you all before i do pass on .
stay free from petty jealousies .
live by no man 's code .
and hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road .
