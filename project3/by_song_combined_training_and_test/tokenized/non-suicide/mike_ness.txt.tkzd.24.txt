#she 's a knockout

everywhere she goes , people turn their heads , she 's a knockout .
everyone wishes she was sleeping in their beds , she 's a knockout .
when guys see her coming they start spending their money , she 's a knockout .
but do n't you know i 'm the only one who can call her honey , she 's a knockout .
she 's a knockout , she 's a knockout , she 's a knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , she 's a knockout .
she 's exotic but not foreign , built like an old cadillac , she 's a knockout .
once she 's left your life she be not never coming back , she 's a knockout .
with her black silk stockings and her high-heeled shoes , she 's a knockout .
once she 's left your life , you 'll surely sing the blues , she 's a knockout .
he 's a knockout , she 's a knockout , she 's a knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , she 's a knockout .
some friends were telling me , just the other day ,
they walk right up to her , they do n't know what to say .
and when she calls me , hear a ring on the telephone ,
i 'll be there waiting for her , sitting at home all alone , all alone .
in the nightclubs baby when the lights shine down , she 's a knockout .
if the feeling be not right she do n't even come around , she 's a knockout .
when she walks down the aisle ya know her hips begin to sway , she 's a knockout .
come on little baby i 'll show you the way , she 's a knockout .
she 's a knockout , she 's a knockout , she 's a knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , knock , she 's a knockout .
