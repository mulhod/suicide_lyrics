#north country blues

come gather around , friends , and i 'll tell you a tale of when the red iron ore pits run plenty .
but the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches tell you now that the whole town is empty .
in the north end of town , my own children're grown , but i was raised on the other .
in the wee hours of youth , my mother took sick and i was brought up by my brother .
the iron ore poured as the years passed the door .
the drag lines and the shovels , they was humming till one day my brother failed to come home , the same as my father before him .
well , the long winter 's wait from the window i watched .
my friends , they could n't 've been kinder .
and my schooling was cut as i quit in the spring to marry john thomas , a miner .
oh , the years passed again and the giving was good with the lunch bucket filled every season .
what with three babies born , the work was cut down to a half a day 's shift with no reason .
then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut and the fire in the air , it felt frozen till a man come to speak and he said in one week that number eleven was closing .
they complained in the east they are paying too high .
they say that your ore be not worth digging , that it 's much cheaper down in the south american towns , where the miners work almost for nothing .
so , the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted and the room smelled heavy from drinking when the sad , silent song made the hour twice as long as i waited for the sun to go sinking .
i lived by the window as he talked to himself .
this silence of tongues , it was building till one morning 's wake the bed , it was bare and i 's left alone with three children .
the summer is gone .
the ground 's turning cold .
the stores one by one , they 're folding .
my children will go as soon as they grow .
well , there be not nothing here now to hold them .
