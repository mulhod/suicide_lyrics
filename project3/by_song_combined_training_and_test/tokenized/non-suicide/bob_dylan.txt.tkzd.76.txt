#day of the locusts

oh , the benches were stained with tears and perspiration .
the birdies were flying from tree to tree .
there was little to say .
there was no conversation as i stepped to the stage to pick up my degree and the locusts sang off in the distance .
yeah , the locusts sang such a sweet melody .
oh , the locusts sang off in the distance .
yeah , the locusts sang and they were singing for me .
i glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking .
darkness was everywhere .
it smelled like a tomb .
i was ready to leave .
i was already walking , but the next time i looked there was light in the room and the locusts sang .
yeah , it give me a chill .
oh , the locusts sang such a sweet melody .
oh , the locusts sang that high , whining trill .
yeah , the locusts sang and they were singing for me .
outside of the gates the trucks were unloading .
the weather was hot , nearly ninety degrees .
the man standing next to me , his head was exploding .
well , i was praying the pieces would n't fall on me !
yeah , and the locusts sang off in the distance .
yeah , the locusts sang such a sweet melody .
oh , the locusts sang off in the distance .
and the locusts sang and they were singing for me .
i put down my robe .
i picked up my diploma , took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive straight for the hills , the black hills of dakota .
sure was glad to get out of there alive !
and the locusts sang .
well , it give me a chill .
yeah , the locusts sang such a sweet melody .
and the locusts sang with that high , whining trill .
yeah , the locusts sang and they were singing for me , singing for me , well , singing for me .
