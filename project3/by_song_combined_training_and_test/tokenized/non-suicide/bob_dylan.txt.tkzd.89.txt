#billy 4

there 's guns across the river about to pound you .
there 's a lawman on your trail like to surround you .
bounty hunters are dancing all around you .
billy , they do n't like you to be so free .
camping out all night on the veranda , walking the streets down by the hacienda , up to boot hill they 'd like to send you .
billy , do n't you turn your back on me .
there 's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces , bullet-holes and rifles in their cases .
there 's always one more notch in four more aces , billy , and you 're playing all alone .
playing around with some sweet seï¿½orita , into her dark chamber she will greet you , in the shadows of the mesa she will lead you , billy , and you 're going all alone .
they say that pat garrett 's got your number , so sleep with one eye open when you wonder if every little sound just might be thunder , thunder from the barrel of his gun .
there 's always another stranger sneaking glances , some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances , some old whore from san pedro 'll make advances , advances on your spirit and your soul .
the businessmen from taos want you to go down , so they 've hired mr . garrett .
he 'll force you to slow down .
billy , do n't it make you feel so low-down to be hunted by the man who was your friend ?
so , hang on to your woman if you 've got one .
remember in el paso once you shot one ?
i 'll be in santa fe about one .
billy , you been running for so long .
gypsy queens will play your grand finale way down in some tularosa alley , maybe in la rio pecas valley .
billy , you 're so far away from home .
billy , you 're so far away from home .
billy , you 're so far away from home .
