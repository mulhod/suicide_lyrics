#bob dylan 's dream

while riding on a train going west , i fell asleep for to take my rest .
i dreamed a dream that made me sad , concerning myself and the first few friends i had .
with half-damp eyes i stared to the room , where my friends and i spent many an afternoon , where we together weathered many a storm , laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn .
by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung , our words was told , our songs was sung , where we longed for nothing and were satisfied , joking and talking about the world outside .
with hungry hearts through the heat and cold , we never much thought we could get very old .
we thought we could sit forever in fun .
our chances really was a million to one .
as easy it was to tell black from white , it was all that easy to tell wrong from right .
and our choices , they was few , so the thought never hit that the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split .
how many a year has passed and gone , many a gamble has been lost and won , and many a road taken by many a first friend and each one i 've never seen again ?
i wish , i wish , i wish in vain that we could sit simply in that room again .
ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat , i 'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that .
