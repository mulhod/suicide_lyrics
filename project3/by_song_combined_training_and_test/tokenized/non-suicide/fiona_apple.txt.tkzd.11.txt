# not about love

the early cars already are drawing deep breaths past my door , and last night 's phrases sick with lack of basis are still writhing on my floor .
and it does n't seem fair that your wicked words should work in holding me down .
no , it does n't seem right to take information given at close range for the gag , and the bind and the ammunition round .
conversation once colored by esteem became duologue as a diagram of a play for blood
took a vacation , my palate got clean .
now i could taste your agenda while you 're spitting your cud .
and it does n't make sense i should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown .
no , it does n't seem right
to take information given at close range for the gag , and the bind , and the ammunition round .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
i miss that stupid ache .
what is this posture i have to stare at .
that 's what he said when i 'm sitting up straight .
change the name of the game because he lost , and he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late .
but i 'm not being fair , because i chose to listen to that filthy mouth , but i 'd like to choose right .
take all the things that i 've said that he stole , put 'em in a sack , swing 'em over my shoulder , turn on my heels , step out of this sight .
try to live in a lovelier light .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
i miss that stupid ache .
