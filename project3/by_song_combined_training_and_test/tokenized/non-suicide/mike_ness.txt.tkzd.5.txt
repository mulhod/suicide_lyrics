#writing on the wall

there was a time when you were proud .
you looked up to me with big eyes , and i could do no wrong .
there 's something inside , that 's clearly tearing both of us apart , ooh ooh there 's something inside .
i wonder where you are tonight , and what you did with your day .
ca n't find the words to say .
did you feel the sun ?
did you feel the warmness of my heart ?
ooh ooh did you feel at all ?
they say if you love someone , you got to let them go .
and if they return to you , that 's surely how you 'll know .
ooh ooh , i can read the writing on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go .
they say if you love someone , you got to let them go .
and if they return to you , that 's surely how you 'll know .
ooh ooh , i can read the writing on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go .
i 'm hopelessly aware of the good and bad traits we share .
it 's like looking at myself .
and i know that at times i could 've handled things differently , ooh ooh , but know my intentions were well .
they say if you love someone , you got to let them go .
and if they return to you , that 's surely how you 'll know .
ooh ooh , i can read the writing on the wall , ooh ooh , but i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
ooh , i ca n't let go .
