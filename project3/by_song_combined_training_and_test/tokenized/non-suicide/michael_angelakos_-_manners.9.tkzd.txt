#let your love grow tall

in pastures blue and green i 'll follow you and you 'll follow me , my fabric 's mystery .
i 'll wave your loyalty in the freezing breeze so desperately .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
i think i see my life .
he bows all slyly and gentle-like .
he 's never had the right .
i 've never lived without his sad and jealous eyes .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
they 'd say , "let your love grow tall , let your love grow tall" .
tall as the grass in the meadow ?
or the dunes on the shore ?
like the buildings in the city ?
and your children on the floor ?
like the darkness in the forest ?
like my frightened worried eyes ?
or the roots in the soil ?
are skies telling lies ?
but it 's the thought that counts .
quiet minds do n't know their worth .
they know what to do , so i 'll pray for them and i 'll pray for you till my face turns blue .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
and another one comes down .
they 'd say , "let your love grow tall , let your love grow tall" .
tall as the grass in the meadow ?
or the dunes on the shore ?
like the buildings in the city ?
and your children on the floor ?
like the darkness in the forest ?
like my frightened worried eyes ?
or the roots in the soil ?
are skies telling lies ?
