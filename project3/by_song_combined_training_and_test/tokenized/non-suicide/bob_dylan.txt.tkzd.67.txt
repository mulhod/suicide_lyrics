# i 'll be your baby tonight

close your eyes .
close the door .
you do n't have to worry anymore .
i 'll be your baby tonight .
shut the light .
shut the shade .
you do n't have to be afraid .
i 'll be your baby tonight .
well , that mockingbird 's going to sail away .
we 're going to forget it .
that big , fat moon is going to shine like a spoon , but we 're going to let it .
you wo n't regret it .
kick your shoes off .
do not fear .
bring that bottle over here .
i 'll be your baby tonight .
