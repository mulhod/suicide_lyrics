#girl from the north country

if you 're traveling in the north country fair , where the winds hit heavy on the borderline , remember me to the one who lives there for she once was a true love of mine .
if you go when the snowflakes storm , when the rivers freeze and summer ends , please see she has a coat so warm to keep her from the howling winds .
please see if her hair hangs long , if it rolls and flows all down her breast .
please see for me if her hair 's hanging long for that 's the way i remember her best .
i 'm wondering if she remembers me at all .
many times i 've often prayed in the darkness of my night , in the brightness of my day .
so , if you 're traveling in the north country fair , where the winds hit heavy on the borderline , remember me to the one who lives there for she once was a true love of mine .
