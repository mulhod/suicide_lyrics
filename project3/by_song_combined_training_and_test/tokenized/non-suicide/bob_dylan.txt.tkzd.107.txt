#do n't think twice , it 's alright

well , it be not no use to sit and wonder why , babe , if you do n't know by now .
and it be not no use to sit and wonder why , babe .
it 'll never do , somehow .
when your rooster crows at the break of dawn , look out your window and i 'll be gone .
you 're the reason i 'm traveling on , but do n't think twice .
it 's alright .
and it be not no use in turning on your light , babe , the light i never knowed .
and it be not no use in turning on your light , babe .
i 'm on the dark side of the road .
but i wish there was something you would do or say to try and make me change my mind and stay , but we never did too much talking anyway .
but do n't think twice .
it 's alright .
so , it be not no use in calling out my name , gal , like you never done before .
and it be not no use in calling out my name , gal .
i ca n't hear you anymore .
i 'm thinking and wondering , walking down the road .
i once loved a woman , a child , i am told .
i give her my heart , but she wanted my soul .
but do n't think twice .
it 's alright .
so long , honey babe .
where i 'm bound i ca n't tell .
goodbye 's too good a word , babe , so i 'll just say , "fare thee well . "
i be not saying you treated me unkind .
you could 've done better , but i do n't mind .
you just kind of wasted my precious time , but do n't think twice .
it 's alright .
