#dear landlord

dear landlord , please do n't put a price on my soul .
my burden is heavy .
my dreams are beyond control .
when that steamboat whistle blows , i 'm going to give you all i got to give and i do hope you receive it well , depending on the way you feel that you live .
dear landlord , please heed these words that i speak .
i know you 've suffered much , but in this you are not so unique .
all of us at times , we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much and anyone can fill his life up with things he can see but he just cannot touch .
dear landlord , please do n't dismiss my case .
i 'm not about to argue .
i 'm not about to move to no other place .
now , each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true and , if you do n't underestimate me , i wo n't underestimate you .
