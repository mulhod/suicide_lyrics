#o ' sailor

i 'm undecided about you again .
might n't be right that you 're not here .
it 's double-sided , cause i ruined it all , but also saved myself , by never believing you , dear .
everything good , i deem too good to be true .
everything else is just a bore .
everything i have to look forward to has a pretty painful and very imposing before .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
i have too been playing with fifty-two cards .
just cause i play so far from my vest .
whatever i 've got , i 've got no reason to guard .
what could i do , but spend my best ?
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
and after waiting , fighting patiently on my knees .
all the other stuff tired itself out first , not me .
and in its wake , appeared the touch and call of a different breed , one who set to get me wise , and got me there , and then got me .
and what a thing , to know what could be instead .
oh , what a blessed curse to see .
it took the agenda from its place in my bed , made a merry paramour of me .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
giving me eyes to view it , as it goes by the boards .
