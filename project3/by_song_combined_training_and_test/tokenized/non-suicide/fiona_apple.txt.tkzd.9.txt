#please please please

please , please , please , no more melodies .
they lack impact ; they 're petty .
they 've been made up already .
please , please , please , no more maladies .
i 'm so tired of crying ; you 'd think i was a siren .
but me and everybody 's on the sad same team and you can hear our sad brain screaming : give us something familiar , something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady , steady , steady going nowhere .
please , please , please , no apologies .
at best they buy you time till you next step out of line .
please , please , please , no more remedies .
my method is uncertain ; it 's a mess but it 's working .
and maybe if you tried it out , you wo n't like it when you 're crying out : give us something familiar something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady , steady , steady , steady going nowhere .
