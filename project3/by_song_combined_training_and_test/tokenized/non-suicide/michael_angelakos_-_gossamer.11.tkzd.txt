#it 's not my fault , i 'm happy

sorry i could n't be there , i was tied to a rocking chair .
i was beat down to a pulp , rocking back and forth somewhere .
if you knew , if you saw , you 'd have said it was the final straw , that my life was bound and tethered on a porch by the shore .
but there is no easy way to tell them so , the things you know .
and run , they say .
they think they know exactly so .
it 's not right , it 's not right .
how am i the only one who sees us fight ?
what are we ?
who are they ?
who says those bastards do n't deserve to pay ?
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance .
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair .
still i 'm the only one who seems to care .
it 's funny that being funny makes you feel like up and running when your past lingers like rain clouds , casting shadows below .
i could live with so many burdens .
i take all your hope and yearning , but there 's no one i want to take me for that petty little rose .
i used to glow .
once i had a love to show , a love they know .
they 're slow , so slow that they never know where i go .
it 's not right , it 's not right .
how am i the only one who sees us fight ?
what are we ?
who are they ?
who says those bastards do n't deserve to pay ?
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance .
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair .
still i 'm the only one who seems to care .
i know that it 's only something .
i 'm just working with what i 've been given .
it 's not my fault , i 'm happy .
do n't call me crazy , i 'm happy .
it 's not right , it 's not right .
how am i the only one who sees us fight ?
what are we ?
who are they ?
who says those bastards do n't deserve to pay ?
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance .
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair .
still i 'm the only one who seems to care .
