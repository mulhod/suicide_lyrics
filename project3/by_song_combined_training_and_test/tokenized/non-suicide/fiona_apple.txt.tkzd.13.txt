#sleep to dream

i tell you how i feel , but you do n't care .
i say tell me the truth , but you do n't dare .
you say love is a hell you cannot bear , and i say gimme mine back and then go there for all i care .
i got my feet on the ground , and i do n't go to sleep to dream .
you got your head in the clouds , and you 're not at all what you seem .
this mind , this body , and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways , so do n't forget what i told you : do n't come around i got my own hell to raise .
i have never been so insulted in all my life .
i could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride .
first you run like a fool just to be at my side , and now you run like a fool , but you just run to hide , and i ca n't abide .
i got my feet on the ground , and i do n't go to sleep to dream .
you got your head in the clouds , and you 're not at all what you seem .
this mind , this body , and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways , so do n't forget what i told you : do n't come around i got my own hell to raise .
do n't make it a big deal .
do n't be so sensitive .
we 're not playing a game anymore .
you do n't have to be so defensive .
do n't you plead me your case .
do n't bother to explain .
do n't even show me your face because it 's a crying shame .
just go back to the rock from under which you came .
take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim , and do n't forget the blame .
i got my feet on the ground , and i do n't go to sleep to dream .
you got your head in the clouds , and you 're not at all what you seem .
this mind , this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways , so do n't forget what i told you : do n't come around i got my own hell to raise .
