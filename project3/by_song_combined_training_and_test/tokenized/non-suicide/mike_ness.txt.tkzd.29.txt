#born to lose

i was brought in this world 1962 , i did n't have much choice you see .
but by the time i was eight , i could tell it was too late , i was already barking up the wrong tree .
when i was in school , you thought i was a fool , in trouble , breaking all the rules .
i was absent from class , my daddy spanked my bare ass , but i sure tried hard to be cool .
born to lose , was what they said , you know i was better off dead .
born to lose , you 're just bad news , you do n't get a second chance .
it was a hot summer night in mid july , a hangover and a black eye .
your momma said i was a loser , a dead end cruiser , and deep inside i know that she was right .
born to lose , was what they said , you know i was better off dead .
born to lose , you 're just bad news , you do n't get a second chance .
i tried to get myself a job because that 's the way that things are , want to have nice things and go far .
well i 'm sorry honey , i be not got much money , but i can sure play this here old
guitar .
as the years went on , i made a few mistakes it was a troublebound for this young man .
the police knocking at my door , " well he do n't live here no more , and he 's playing in a rock 'n' roll band . "
born to lose , was what they said , you know i was better off dead .
born to lose , you 're just bad news , you do n't get a second chance .
