#fourth time around

when she said , "do n't waste your words , they 're just lies , " i cried she was deaf as she worked on my face till breaking my eyes , then said , "what else you got left ? "
it was then that i got up to leave , but she said , "do n't forget .
everybody must give something back for something they get . "
i stood there and hummed .
i tapped on her drum .
i asked her , "how come ? "
and she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit .
then she said , "do n't get cute . "
so i forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs and gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum .
she threw me outside .
i stood in the dirt where everyone walked .
and , after finding that i 'd forgotten my shirt , i went back and knocked .
i waited in the hallway .
she went to get it and i tried to make sense out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against her jamaican rum and , when she did come , i asked her for some .
she said , "no , dear . "
i said , "your words are n't clear .
you better spit out your plum . "
she screamed till her face got so red .
then she fell on the floor and i covered her up and then thought i 'll go look through her drawer .
and when i was through , i filled up my shoe and brought it to you .
and you , you took me in .
you loved me then .
you never wasted time ,
and i , i never took much .
i never asked for your crutch .
now , do n't ask for mine .
