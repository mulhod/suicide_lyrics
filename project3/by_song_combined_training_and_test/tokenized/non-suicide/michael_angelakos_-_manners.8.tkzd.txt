# to kingdom come

that 's a frosty way to speak , o tell me how to live next to your potpourri .
all this talking pulls my teeth .
i believed in you , so you believed in me .
i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
once i had a name to claim .
i scraped on the walls like an orthodox saint .
i wish for the same old things that turn me inside out .
hearing is the strain .
it 's a game .
me , i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
never have i ever been clutching at your hair to cure you of some sin , but that 's the kind of state i 'm in , swimming in a pool of godly medicine .
" come , come , " i hear it calling me , yelling like if ever there was someone who could make things heavenly again .
feel alive .
me , i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
me , i cried out , "god " .
you dared me in the dark .
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark .
so now i hide in piles of princely orange peels .
it feels the way you told me how it 'd always feel .
