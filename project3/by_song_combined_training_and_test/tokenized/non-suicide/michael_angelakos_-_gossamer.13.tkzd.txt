#almost there

there are things you 'll never learn , like there 's nothing to hide from .
house of people at your door .
give it away , they 'll just take more .
but i do n't know what you want , but i ca n't get it out of my brain .
yeah , you 're almost there .
there are things you 'll never do , like even try to hurt me too .
god knows something more than ruin .
put you down and blamed my moods .
all this talk - i swear , i ca n't get it out of my brain .
yeah , you 're almost there .
yeah , you 're almost there .
