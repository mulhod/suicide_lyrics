#motorpsycho nightmare

i pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay .
i was mighty , mighty tired .
i had come a long , long way .
i said , "hey , hey , in there , is there anybody home ? "
i was standing on the steps feeling most alone when out comes a farmer .
he must 've thought that i was nuts .
he immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts .
i fell down to my bended knees , saying , "i dig farmers , do n't shoot me , please ! "
he cocked his rifle and began to shout , "are you that traveling salesman that i have heard about ? "
i said , "no , no , no!
i 'm a doctor and it 's true .
i 'm a clean-cut kid and i been to college , too . "
then in comes his daughter , whose name was rita .
she looked like she stepped out of the dolce vita .
i immediately tried to cool it with her dad and told him what a nice , pretty farm he had .
he said , "what do doctors know about farms , pray tell ? "
i said , "i was born at the bottom of a wishing well . "
well , by the dirt beneath my nails , i guess , he knew i would n't lie .
he said , "i guess you 're tired . "
he said it kind of sly .
i said , "yes , ten thousand miles today i drove . "
he said , "i got a bed for you underneath the stove .
just one condition , you can go to sleep right now : that you do n't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows . "
i was sleeping like a rat when i heard something jerking .
there stood rita , looking just like tony perkins .
she said , "would you like to take a shower ?
i 'll show you up to the door . "
i said , "oh , no , no!
i 've been through this movie before ! "
i knew i had to split , but i did not know how when she said , "would you like to take that shower now ? "
well , i could n't leave unless the old man chased me out because i 'd already promised that i 'd milk his cows .
i had to say something to strike him very weird , so i yelled , "i like fidel castro and his beard ! "
rita looked offended , but she got out of the way as he came charging down the stairs , saying , "what 's that i heard you say ? "
i said , "i like fidel castro .
i think you heard me right . "
and i ducked as he swung at me with all his might .
rita mumbled something about her mother on the hill as his fist , it hit the icebox .
he said he 's going to kill me if i do n't get out the door in two seconds flat , "you unpatriotic , rotten doctor , commie rat ! "
well , he threw a reader 's digest at my head and i did run .
i did a somersault as i seen him get his gun and crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour and landed fully blast in his garden flowers .
rita said , " come back ! " and he started to load .
the sun was coming up and i was running down the road .
well , i do n't figure i 'll be back there for a spell even though rita moved away and got a job at a motel .
he still waits for me , constant on the sly .
he wants to turn me in to the f.b.i .
me , i romp and stomp , thankful as i romp .
without freedom of speech i might be in the swamp .
