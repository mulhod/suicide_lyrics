#harvest moon

come a little bit closer , hear what i have to say .
just like children sleepinh , we could dream this night away .
but there 's a full moon rising .
let 's go dancing in the light .
we know where the music 's playing .
let 's go out and feel the night because i 'm still in love with you .
i want to see you dance again because i 'm still in love with you on this harvest moon .
when we were strangers , i watched you from afar .
when we were lovers , i loved you with all my heart .
but now it 's getting late and the moon is climbing high .
i want to celebrate , see it shining in your eye , because i 'm still in love with you .
i want to see you dance again , because i 'm still in love with you on this harvest moon .
