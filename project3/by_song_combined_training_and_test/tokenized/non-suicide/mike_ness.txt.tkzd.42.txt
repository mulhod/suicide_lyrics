#down here ( with the rest of us )

you work hard now , to put the food on the table .
you 're working for the men who do n't even know your name .
that 's the way that it goes when you 're down here with the rest of us .
you might lose now , your beautiful children , your happy home , yeah , and your beautiful wife .
that 's the way that it goes when you 're down here with the rest of us .
you 'll suffer hard now as you bury your loved ones .
you 'll suffer hard now when you lose your best friend .
that 's the way that it goes when you 're down here with the rest of us .
that 's the way that it goes and i know how you feel .
no one 's immune now , to a world of problems .
no ones exempt now from a world of pain .
that 's the way that it goes when you 're down here with the rest of us .
i try hard now to do the right thing , yet i wonder why i still do what 's wrong .
that 's the way that it goes when you 're down here with the rest of us .
that 's the way that it goes and i know how you feel .
