#waltz ( better than fine )

if you do n't have a song to sing , you 're okay .
you know how to get along humming , hmmm .
if you do n't have a date , celebrate .
go out and sit on the lawn and do nothing .
because it 's just what you must do .
nobody does it anymore .
no i do n't believe in the wasting of time , but i do n't believe that i 'm wasting mine .
if you do n't have a point to make , do n't sweat it .
you 'll make a sharp one being so kind .
and i 'd sure appreciate it .
everyone else 's goal 's to get big headed .
why should i follow that beat being that i 'm better than fine ?
