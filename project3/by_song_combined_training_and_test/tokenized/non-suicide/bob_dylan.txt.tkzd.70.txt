#lay lady lay

lay , lady , lay , lay across my big brass bed .
lay , lady , lay , lay across my big brass bed .
whatever colors you have in your mind , i 'll show them to you and you 'll see them shine .
lay , lady , lay , lay across my big brass bed .
stay , lady , stay , stay with your man awhile .
until the break of day let me see you make him smile .
his clothes are dirty , but his , his hands are clean and you 're the best thing that he 's ever seen .
stay , lady , stay , stay with your man awhile .
why wait any longer for the world to begin ?
you can have your cake and eat it too .
why wait any longer for the one you love when he 's standing in front of you ?
lay , lady , lay , lay across my big brass bed .
stay , lady , stay , stay while the night is still ahead .
i long to see you in the morning light .
i long to reach for you in the night .
stay , lady , stay , stay while the night is still ahead .
