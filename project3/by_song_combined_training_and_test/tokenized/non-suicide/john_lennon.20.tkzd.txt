#surprise , surprise ( sweet bird of paradox )

sweet as the smell of success , her body 's warm and wet .
she gets me through this god-awful loneliness , a natural high butterfly , oh i , i need , need , need her .
just like a willow tree , a breath of spring , you see , and , oh , boy , you do n't know what she do to me .
she makes me sweat and forget who i am .
i need , need , need , need her .
well , i was wondering how long this could go on , on and on .
well , i thought i could never be surprised .
but could it be that i bit my own tongue ?
oh , yeah , it 's so hard to swallow when you 're wrong .
a bird of paradise , the sunrise in her eyes .
god only knows such a sweet surprise .
i was blind .
she blew my mind .
think that i , i love , love , love , love , love her .
i love her , i love her , i love her , i love her .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
sweet sweet , sweet sweet love .
