#heresy

he sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see .
he tries to tell me what i put inside of me .
he 's got the answers to ease my curiosity .
he dreamed up a god and called it christianity .
your god is dead , and no one cares .
if there is a hell i 'll see you there .
he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line .
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine .
his perfect kingdom of killing , suffering , and pain demands devotion atrocities done in his name .
your god is dead and no one cares .
if there is a hell , i 'll see you there .
your god is dead and no one cares .
if there is a hell , i 'll see you there .
god is dead .
god is dead .
god is dead .
god is dead .
god is dead .
your god is dead and no one cares .
if there is a hell , i 'll see you there .
your god is dead and no one cares .
drowning in his own hypocrisy .
and if there is a hell i will see you there .
burning with your god in humility .
will you die for this ?
