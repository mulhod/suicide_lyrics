# though i know she lies

when i look though your eyes , i tend to get bitter .
maybe i 'm best advised to look to myself .
i fall every time , though i know she lies .
i ca n't stay away .
stars would fall from the sky , and i wo n't forsake you .
you 've got lust in your heart .
what 's sad to me ?
i 'll use every line , anything to make you mine .
keeping me in the dark .
wondering where you are .
do n't let me fall apart .
you said take it slow , but i do n't know .
i do n't know .
lying awake in the bed trying to cope with the feelings .
i do n't know if it 's love , but what can i do ?
i fall every time , though i know she lies .
i ca n't stay away .
