#black crow blues

i woke in the morning wandering , weary and worn out .
i woke in the morning wandering , weary and worn out , wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me , talk to me , tell me what it 's all about .
i was standing at the side road , listening to the billboard knock , standing at the side road , listening to the billboard knock .
well , my wrist was empty , but my nerves were kicking , ticking like a clock .
if i got anything you need , babe , let me tell you in front .
if i got anything you need , babe , let me tell you in front .
you can come to me sometime , night-time , day-time , any time you want .
sometimes i 'm thinking i 'm too high to fall .
sometimes i 'm thinking i 'm much too high to fall .
other times i 'm thinking i 'm so low i do n't know if i can come up at all .
black crows in the meadow , sleeping across a broad highway .
black crows in the meadow , across a broad highway .
though it 's funny , honey , i 'm out of touch , do n't feel much like a scarecrow today .
