#tell me that it is n't true

i have heard rumors all over town .
they say that you 're planning to put me down .
all i 'd like you to do is tell me that it is n't true .
they say that you 've been seen with some other man , that he 's tall , dark , and handsome and you 're holding his hand .
darling , i 'm counting on you .
tell me that it is n't true .
to know that some other man is holding you tight , it hurts me all over .
it does n't seem right .
all of these awful things that i have heard , i do n't want to believe them .
all i want is your word .
so , darling , you better come through .
tell me that it is n't true .
all of these awful things that i have heard , i do n't want to believe them .
all i want is your word .
so , darling , i 'm counting on you .
tell me that it is n't true .
