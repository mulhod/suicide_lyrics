#forever young

may god bless and keep you always .
may your wishes all come true .
may you always do for others and let others do for you .
may you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung .
may you stay forever young , forever young , forever young .
may you stay forever young .
may you grow up to be righteous .
may you grow up to be true .
may you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you .
may you always be courageous , stand upright and be strong .
and may you stay forever young , forever young , forever young .
may you stay forever young .
may your hands always be busy .
may your feet always be swift .
may you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift .
may your heart always be joyful .
may your song always be sung .
and may you stay forever young , forever young , forever young .
may you stay forever young .
