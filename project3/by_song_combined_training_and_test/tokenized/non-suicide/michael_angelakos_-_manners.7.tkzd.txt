#folds in your hands

leave me alone , leave me alone , leave me alone .
i 'm fine .
i 'll be fine until the morning comes , then unmask me in the blistering sun .
oh , let me go , just let me go , just let me go or i 'll burst in front of your eyes , then collect myself from the ground .
and when i go , and when i go , just let me go like a light , flickering out in the skies , lost as fast as was found .
everything 's easy when you never have to choose .
with the balances shifting it refers to you .
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom .
i will crush our love , let it burn until i get to you .
lay low .
do n't let me know what is real .
we 'll be quietly following you .
will they take me as their own ?
now i will hold you .
i will keep you up and show my love until it folds in my hands , but i 'll build it back to the top .
everything 's easy when you never have to choose .
with the balances shifting it refers to you .
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom .
i will crush our love , let it burn until i get to you .
feel it rain , feel it rain , my love , feel it rain .
