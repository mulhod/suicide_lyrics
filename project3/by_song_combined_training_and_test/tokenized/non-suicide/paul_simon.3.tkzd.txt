#blessed

blessed are the meek for they shall inherit .
blessed is the lamb whose blood flows .
blessed are the sat upon , spat upon , ratted on .
o lord , why have you forsaken me ?
i got no place to go .
i 've walked around soho for the last night or so , ah , but it does n't matter , no .
blessed is the land and the kingdom .
blessed is the man whose soul belongs to .
blessed are the meth drinkers , pot sellers , illusion dwellers .
o lord , why have you forsaken me ?
my words trickle down , from a wound that i have no intention to heal .
blessed are the stained glass , window pane glass .
blessed is the church service , makes me nervous .
blessed are the penny rookers , cheap hookers , groovy lookers .
o lord , why have you forsaken me ?
i have tended my own garden much too long .
