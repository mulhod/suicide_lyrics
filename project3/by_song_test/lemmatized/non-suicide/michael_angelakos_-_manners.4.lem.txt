# the reel we dig this hole we crawl into . 
now they 're me home . 
now here i can feel the wind , ca n't feel the rain , oh , no , and i believe in gentle harmony . 
well , how i loathe all this obscenity . 
be this the way me life have get to be ? 
have i a single opportunity ? 
look at me , oh , look at me . 
be this the way i 'll always be ? 
oh , no , oh , no . 
now i pray this somebody will quickly come and kidnap me . 
oh , no , oh , no . 
every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day . 
oh , no , oh , no . 
here i be , oh , here i be . 
oh , when will someone understand ? 
oh , no , oh , no . 
and all at once i feel this . 
oh , how it cling to me . 
it reel and call me toward it , confound destiny . 
and i can feel the madness inch by inch . 
the more i run the more i be convince . 
a color all this like the branch glimpse just like the saddle in the foggy mist . 
look at me , oh , look at me . 
be this the way i 'll always be ? 
oh , no , oh , no . 
now i pray this somebody will quickly come and kidnap me . 
oh , no , oh , no . 
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day . 
oh , no , oh , no . 
here i be , oh , here i be . 
oh , when will someone understand ? 
oh , no , oh , no . 
look at me , oh , look at me . 
be this the way i 'll always be ? 
oh ,no , oh , no . 
now i pray this somebody will quickly come and kidnap me . 
oh , no , oh , no . 
and every day i lie awake and pray to god today 's the day . 
oh , no , oh , no . 
here i be , oh , here i be . 
oh , when will someone understand ? 
oh , no , oh , no .
