" #april come he will april come he will when stream be ripe and swell with rain . 
may he will stay rest in me arm again . 
june he 'll change he tune . 
in restless walk he 'll prowl the night . 
july he will fly and give no warn to he flight . 
august die he must . 
the autumn wind blow chilly and cold . 
september i remember a love once new have now grow old .
