#you to thank by the time the buzz be wear off , we be stand out on the sidewalk with we tattoo this look like ring in the hot nevada sun . 
kid pile high , and we mom and dad shake hand in a party of polaroid friend , rent a pool and hire a band . 
maybe they know more then we know because they dance and drink while we jump off the deep end . 
oh i 've get you to thank for this . 
christmas come around , yeah , and everything be go to crap and we mom and dad not a clue to be have . 
yeah , we put on a pretty good act and they seem to all need to believe it , so we dance and smile and paddle hard beneath it . 
oh i 've get you to thank for this . 
you ca n't say you 've never have a doubt and smoke it down but really want out . 
by the time the buzz be wear off , we be stand out on the sidewalk with we tattoo this look like ring in the hot nevada sun . 
and they wo n't fade . 
i 've get you to thank .
