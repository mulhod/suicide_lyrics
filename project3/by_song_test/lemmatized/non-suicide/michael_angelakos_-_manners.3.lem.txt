#moth 's wing dear friend , as you know you flower be wither , you mother 's go insane , you leave have drift away , but the cloud be clear up and i 've come revel , burn incandescently like a bastard on the burn sea . 
you 're just like you father , bury deep under the water . 
you 're rest on you laurel and step on me toe . 
who side be you on ? 
what side be this anyway ? 
put down you sword and crown . 
come lie with me on the grind . 
you come beat like moth 's wing , spastic and violently , whip me into a storm , shake me down to the core , but you run away from me and you leave me shimmer like diamond wed ring spin dizzily down on the floor . 
you 're just like you father , bury deep under the water . 
you 're rest on you laurel and step on me toe . 
who side be you on ? 
what side be this anyway ? 
put down you sword and crown . 
come lie with me on the grind .
