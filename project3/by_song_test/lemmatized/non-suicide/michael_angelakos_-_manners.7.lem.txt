#folds in you hand leave me alone , leave me alone , leave me alone . 
i 'm fine . 
i 'll be fine until the morning come , then unmask me in the blister sun . 
oh , let me go , just let me go , just let me go or i 'll burst in front of you eye , then collect me from the grind . 
and when i go , and when i go , just let me go like a light , flicker out in the sky , lose as fast as be find . 
everything 's easy when you never have to choose . 
with the balance shift it refer to you . 
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom . 
i will crush we love , let it burn until i get to you . 
lie low . 
do n't let me know what be real . 
we 'll be quietly follow you . 
will they take me as they own ? 
now i will hold you . 
i will keep you up and show me love until it fold in me hand , but i 'll build it back to the top . 
everything 's easy when you never have to choose . 
with the balance shift it refer to you . 
like the sun and the moon i will circle you till you bloom . 
i will crush we love , let it burn until i get to you . 
feel it rain , feel it rain , me love , feel it rain .
