#seaweed song some day you 'll see , surround by angel , float atop of the sea . 
abandon me . 
do n't go where they go . 
do n't sing all the song they sing . 
nobody know you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i think i know . 
yeah , i think i know . 
nobody know you the way you know you , but i think i do . 
but i think i know . 
yeah , i think i know . 
between this wall he back , strange glimpse , cast shadow frighteningly tall . 
i slow to a crawl . 
i jump and i yell , but he hear nothing at all . 
nobody know you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i think i know . 
yeah , i think i know . 
nobody know you the way you know you , but i think i do , ut i think i know . 
yeah , i think i know . 
stay , stay the same beause everything else will change and i 've always be to blame , so please just stay the same . 
the current pull me in . 
the tide have reach me chin . 
the seaweed tickle skin . 
just let the water win . 
i 'm freeze to the bone . 
you 'll never be at home . 
just watch , you 're run out . 
just watch you body go . 
nobody know you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i think i know . 
yeah , i think i know . 
nobody know you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i think i know . 
yeah , i think i know .
