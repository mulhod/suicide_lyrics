the man walk down the street keep he head down low . 
do n't look up , want to give up . 
he just keep on look down , stare at the grind . 
stand here at the corner i 'm watch he walk away . 
stand here and i do n't know why , but i 'm think it can be a great day . 
look up . 
look up . 
you 'll see the sky .

he 's be wait for so long . 
if you look up , you 'll see he . 
you know we 're all alone . 
look up . 
look up . 
you 'll see the sky . 
look up . 
look up . 
he 's the life wait to love you , want to reach you . 
look up . 
look up .
