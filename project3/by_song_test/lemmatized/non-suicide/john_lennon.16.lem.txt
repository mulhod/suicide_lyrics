#i know ( i know ) the year have pass so quickly . 
one thing i 've understand : i be only learn to tell the tree from wood . 
i know what 's come down and i know where it 's come from and i know and i 'm sorry , yes , i be , but i never can speak me mind . 
and i know just how you feel and i know now what i have do and i know and i 'm guilty , but i never can speak me mind . 
i know what i be miss , but now me eye can see . 
i put me in you place as you do for me . 
today i love you more than yesterday . 
right now i love you more right now . 
now i know what 's come down . 
i can feel where it 's come from and i know it 's get well all the time as we share in each other 's mind .
