#dreaming man i 'm a dream man , yes , this 's me problem . 
i ca n't tell when i 'm not be real . 
in the meadow dusk i park me aerostar with a load gun and sweet dream of you . 
i 'll always be a dream man . 
i do n't have to understand . 
i know it 's alright . 
i see you curve and i feel you vibration , you dress in black and white , you lose in the mall . 
i watch you disappear past club med vacation . 
another sleepless night , a sun this wo n't fall . 
i 'll always be a dream man . 
i do n't have to understand . 
i know it 's alright . 
now the night be go , a new day be dawn , and we homeless dream go back to the street . 
another time or place , another civilization will really make this life feel so complete . 
i 'll always be a dream man . 
i do n't have to understand . 
i know it 's alright . 
dream man , he 's get a problem . 
dream man , dream man , he 's get a problem . 
dream man .
