#swimming in the flood me eye have once again be prove wrong . 
you cloud , you blanket , and me pity song , hover on you front lawn , carry on until it 's go . 
what can i do ? 
the river 's overrun . 
we 're swim in a flood , you know ? 
i think i feel you touch , but the water 's rise up . 
then i lie naked in a rampage in the flesh , face to face with the onset . 
i forget everything this 's ever make me . 
rise again . 
now slowly leave me memory . 
what can i do ? 
the river 's overrun . 
we 're swim in a flood , you know ? 
i think i feel you touch , but the water 's rise up . 
now all me lover raise they cup . 
what can i do ? 
the river 's overrun . 
we 're swim in a flood , you know ? 
i think i feel you touch , but the water 's rise up . 
now all me lover raise they cup .
