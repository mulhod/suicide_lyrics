the sound of silence hello darkness , me old friend . 
i 've come to talk with you again because a vision softly creep , leave it seed while i be sleep . 
and the vision this be plant in me brain still remain within the sound of silence . 
in restless dream i walk alone , narrow street of cobblestone . 
beneath the halo of a street lamp , i turn me collar to the cold and damp . 
when me eye be stab by the flash of a neon light this split the night and touch the sound of silence . 
and in the naked light , i see ten thousand people , maybe more . 
people talk without speak , people hear without listen , people write song this voice never share . 
and no one dare disturb the sound of silence . 
"fools " say i ,"you do not know silence like a cancer grow . 
hear me word this i may teach you . 
take me arm this i may reach you " . 
but me word like silent raindrop fall and echo in the well of silence . 
and the people bow and pray to the neon god they make . 
and the sign flash out it warn in the word this it be form . 
and the sign say , 'the word of the prophet be write on the subway wall and tenement hall and whisper 'd in the sound of silence .
