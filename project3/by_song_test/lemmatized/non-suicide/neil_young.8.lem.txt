#from hank to hendrix from hank to hendrix i walk this street with you . 
here i be with this old guitar , do what i do . 
i always expect this you will see me through . 
i never believe in much , but i believe in you . 
can we get it together ? 
can we still stand side by side ? 
can we make it last , like a musical ride ? 
from marilyn to madonna i always love you smile . 
now we 're head for the big divorce , california-style . 
i find me sing like a long-lost friend . 
the same thing this make you live can kill you in the end . 
can we get it together ? 
can we still stand side by side ? 
can we make it last , like a musical ride ? 
sometime it 's distort , not clearly to you sometime the beauty of love just come ring through . 
new glass in the window , new leaf on the tree , new distance between we , you and me . 
can we get it together ? 
can we still walk side by side ? 
can we make it last , like a musical ride ?
