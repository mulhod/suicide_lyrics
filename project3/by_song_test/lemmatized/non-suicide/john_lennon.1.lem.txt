imagine imagine there 's no heaven . 
it 's easy if you try . 
no hell below we , above we only sky . 
imagine all the people live for today . 
imagine there 's no country . 
it be n't hard to do . 
nothing to kill or die for , and no religion too . 
imagine all the people live life in peace . 
you may say i 'm a dreamer , but i 'm not the only one . 
i hope someday you 'll join we , and the world will be as one . 
imagine no possession . 
i wonder if you can . 
no need for greed or hunger , a brotherhood of man . 
imagine all the people share all the world . 
you may say i 'm a dreamer , but i 'm not the only one . 
i hope someday you 'll join we , and the world will live as one .
