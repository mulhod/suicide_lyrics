#leaves this be green i be twenty-one year when i write this song . 
i 'm twenty-two now but i wo n't be for long . 
time hurry on . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
once me heart be fill with the love of a girl . 
i hold he close , but he fade in the night like a poem i mean to write . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
i throw a pebble in a brook . 
and watch the ripple run away . 
and they never make a sound . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand . 
hello , hello , hello , hello . 
good-bye , good-bye , good-bye , good-bye . 
this 's all there be . 
and the leave this be green turn to brown . 
and they wither with the wind . 
and they crumble in you hand .
