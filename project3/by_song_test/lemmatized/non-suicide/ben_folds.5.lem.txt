#gracie you ca n't fool me , i see you when you come out . 
you get you mama 's taste but you get me mouth . 
and you will always have a part of me nobody else be ever go to see , gracie girl , with you card to you chest walk on you toe . 
what you get in the box only gracie know . 
and i will never try to make you be anything you do n't really want to be , gracie girl . 
life fly by in second . 
you 're not a baby , gracie , you 're me friend . 
you 'll be a lady soon but until then you get to do what i say . 
you nod off in me arm watch tv. 
i wo n't move you an inch even though me arm 's asleep. one day you 're go to want to go . 
i hope we teach you everything you need to know , gracie girl . 
and there will always be a part of me nobody else be ever go to see but you and me , me little girl , me gracie girl .
