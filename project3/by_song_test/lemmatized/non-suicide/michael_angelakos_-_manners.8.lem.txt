# to kingdom come this 's a frosty way to speak , o tell me how to live next to you potpourri . 
all this talk pull me teeth . 
i believe in you , so you believe in me . 
i cry out , "god " . 
you dare me in the dark . 
i feel a hush fall quietly from me spark . 
so now i hide in pile of princely orange peel . 
it feel the way you tell me how it 'd always feel . 
once i have a name to claim . 
i scrape on the wall like an orthodox saint . 
i wish for the same old thing this turn me inside out . 
hear be the strain . 
it 's a game . 
me , i cry out , "god " . 
you dare me in the dark . 
i feel a hush fall quietly from me spark . 
so now i hide in pile of princely orange peel . 
it feel the way you tell me how it 'd always feel . 
never have i ever be clutch at you hair to cure you of some sin , but this 's the kind of state i 'm in , swim in a pool of godly medicine . 
" come , come , " i hear it call me , yell like if ever there be someone who can make thing heavenly again . 
feel alive . 
me , i cry out , "god " . 
you dare me in the dark . 
i feel a hush fall quietly from me spark . 
so now i hide in pile of princely orange peel . 
it feel the way you tell me how it 'd always feel . 
me , i cry out , "god " . 
you dare me in the dark . 
i feel a hush fall quietly from me spark . 
so now i hide in pile of princely orange peel . 
it feel the way you tell me how it 'd always feel .
