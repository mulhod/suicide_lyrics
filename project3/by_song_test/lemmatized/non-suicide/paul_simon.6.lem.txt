#richard cory they say this richard cory own one half of this whole town , with political connection to spread he wealth around . 
bear into society , a banker 's only child , he have everything a man can want : power , grace , and style . 
but i work in he factory . 
and i curse the life i 'm live . 
and i curse me poverty . 
and i wish this i can be , oh , i wish this i can be , oh , i wish this i can be richard cory . 
the paper print he picture almost everywhere he go : richard cory at the opera , richard cory at a show . 
and the rumor of he party and the orgy on he yacht ! 
oh , he surely must be happy with everything he 's get . 
but i work in he factory . 
and i curse the life i 'm live . 
and i curse me poverty . 
and i wish this i can be , oh , i wish this i can be , oh , i wish this i can be richard cory . 
he freely give to charity . 
he have the common touch . 
and they be grateful for he patronage and thank he very much . 
so me mind be fill with wonder when the even headline read : "richard cory wend home last night and put a bullet through he head . 
" but i work in he factory . 
and i curse the life i 'm live . 
and i curse me poverty . 
and i wish this i can be , oh , i wish this i can be , oh , i wish this i can be richard cory .
