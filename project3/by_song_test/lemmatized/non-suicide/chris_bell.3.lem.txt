#speed of sound i remember the first time you say you love me . 
i wait all weekend . 
you never call me . 
so you find he attractive . 
so what if he be ? 
you 'd like some excitement . 
you can count he same kiss . 
so it go on and on . 
me love grow and you be go . 
a lonely existence , well it 's just a lie . 
if there be a reason , i 'd like to know why . 
something i want you to know : i 've tell you this once before , do n't want you to see he no more . 
once again you 've let me down , break me heart , and turn me around . 
there 's a light in the darkness . 
it do n't seem far . 
be something the matter this 's bring we ajar ? 
the plane go down , will not land . 
pilot 's dead . 
nowhere to be find .
