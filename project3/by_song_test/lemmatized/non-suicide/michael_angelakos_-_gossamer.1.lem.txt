take a walk all this kind of place make it seem like it 's be age . 
tomorrow some new build will scrape the sky . 
i love this country dearly , i can feel the ladder clearly , but i never think i 'd be alone to try . 
once i be outside penn station sell red and white carnation . 
we be still alone , me wife and i , before we marry , save me money , bring me dear wife over . 
now i work to bring me family stateside , but off the boat they stay awhile , then scatter across the coast . 
once a year i 'll see they for a week or so at more . 
i take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk i take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk practice be n't perfect , but the market cut the loss . 
i remind me this time can be much worse . 
me wife wo n't ask me question . 
there 's not so much to ask and he 'll never flaunt around an empty purse . 
once me mother-in-law come just to stay a couple night , then decide he will stay the rest of he life . 
i watch me little child play some board game in the kitchen and i sit and pray they never feel me strife . 
but then me partner call to say the pension fund be go . 
he make some bad investment . 
now the account be overdraw . 
i take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk i take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk , take a walk honey , it 's you son . 
i think i borrow just too much . 
we have tax , we have bill , we have a lifestyle to front and tonight i swear i 'll come home and we 'll make love like we 're young and tomorrow you 'll cook dinner for the neighbor and they kid . 
we can rip apart this socialist and all they damn tax , but see i be no criminal . 
i 'm down on both bad knee . 
i 'm just too much a coward to admit when i 'm in need .
