#there be a light there be a light so dear to me i want to live . 
there be a time so near to me i ask you to give you life to me . 
if it 's a sign send down to me , i 'm ask you why it have to be . 
spend all me time , wait to die - what 's the use ? 
there be a light so dear to me i want to live . 
there be a time so dear to me i ask you to give you life to me .
