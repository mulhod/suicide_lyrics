# when you awake ollie tell me , i 'm a fool , so i walk on down the road a mile , wend to the house this bring a smile , sit upon me grandpa 's knee and what do you think he say to me ? 
when you awake , you will remember everything . 
you will be hang on a string from your... when you believe , you will relieve the only soul this you be bear with to grow old and never know . 
ollie show me the fork in the road . 
you can take to the leave or go straight to the right . 
use you day and save you night . 
careful where you step and watch what you eat . 
sleep with the light and you get it beat . 
when you awake , you will remember everything . 
you will be hang on a string from your... when you believe , you will relieve the only soul this you be bear with to grow old and never know . 
ollie warn me , it 's mean old world . 
the street do n't greet you , yes , it 's true . 
what be i suppose to do ? 
read the write on the wall . 
i hear it when i be very small . 
when you awake , you will remember everything . 
you will be hang on a string from your... when you believe , you will relieve the only soul this you be bear with to grow old and never know . 
wash me hand in lye water , i get a date with the captain 's daughter . 
you can go and tell you brother . 
we sure gonna love one another , oh , yeah . 
may be right and you may be wrong . 
i ai n't gonna worry all day long . 
snow 's gonna come and the frost gonna bite . 
me old car freeze up last night . 
ai n't no reason to hang me head . 
i can wake up in the morning dead .
