#in a station once i walk through the hall of a station . 
someone call you name . 
in the street i hear child laugh . 
they all sound the same . 
wonder , can you ever know me , know the reason why i live ? 
be there nothing you can show me ? 
life seem so little to give . 
once i climb up the face of a mountain and eat the wild fruit there , fall asleep until the moonlight wake me and i can taste you hair . 
be n't everybody dream ? 
then the voice i hear be real . 
out of all the idle scheme , ca n't we have something to feel ? 
once upon a time they use me indeed . 
tomorrow never come . 
i can sing the sound of you laughter . 
still i do n't know you name . 
must be some way to repay you out of all the good you give . 
if a rumour should delay you , love seem so little to say .
