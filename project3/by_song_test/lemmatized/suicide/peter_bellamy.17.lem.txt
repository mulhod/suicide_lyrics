# the still and silent ocean across the still and the silent ocean we ship he find he way alone . 
the crow they make no loud commotion . 
the chain transport they make no moan . 
all black despair do lie behind we , and what await we no man may know . 
of this dark day naught can remind we . 
new world be wait to which we go . 
be we in chain ? 
we do not feel they . 
be we ill-quartered ? 
we do n't complain . 
do we have guard ? 
we do not see they . 
do we have sickness ? 
we fall no pain . 
for the night be pass . 
new day be dawn . 
winter be over , and spring draw nigh . 
what 's do be do . 
there 's no time for mourn . 
what 's lose be lose , and there 's no time to sigh . 
god bless this tender-hearted creature who bring we back to we own again . 
good health to all who kind deed do reach we . 
good luck to they who do ease we pain . 
glad fortune come to mrs . 
jackson , to bold john simpson and lord sydney too . 
almighty god , do spare and keep they , and grant they peace when they day be through . 
come all you poor benight convict . 
come join we in we present joy . 
come all you seaman who sail the tropic . 
rejoice with we this we goal be nigh . 
when we 're ashore the priest will wed we , as soon as we do reach the strand . 
salute the captain who here have lead we to the hopeful pasture of van diemen 's land !
