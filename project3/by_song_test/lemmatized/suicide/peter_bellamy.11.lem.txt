# the black and bitter night it be cold , sad , and lonely in this dismal cell . 
no solace come up with the day . 
me heart know an anguish this no tongue can tell since they 've take me true love away . 
oh , the black and bitter night , and oh , the weary day . 
me love have be snatch far , far from me sight , and the transport will bear he away . 
when first in this prison so deep be me pain . 
then he come and he banish dismay . 
but now in despondence i 'm drown again , for they 've take me true love away . 
though surround by horror , yet we find delight , for where love be , no sorrow can stay . 
but misery and squalor swim back to me sight now they 've take me true love away why , the grass still grow , and the stream still down flow , and the blackbird still sing on the spray . 
but in dank , deary dungeon there 's nothing but woe since they 've take me true love away . 
well , if i be a seagull , i 'd fly to he side , and it 's there this i wish i can stay . 
but soon the cruel prison ship leave with the tide and they 've bear me true love away . 
if i be a herring , i 'd wait by the slip , though i wait a year and a day . 
then through the wide ocean i 'd follow the ship this be bear me true love away so lover , cling fast to each pleasure you find and cherish each moment of play , for all you will have be what stay in you mind once they 've take you true love away .
