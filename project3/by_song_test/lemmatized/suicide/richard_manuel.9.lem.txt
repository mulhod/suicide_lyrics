#sleeping for the life we choose in the even we rise just long enough to be lover again and for nothing more . 
the world be too sore to live in . 
sad old ship , a morning eclipse . 
i spend me whole life guess . 
then i turn from the sun and see everyone search . 
the hoot owl and he song will bring you along . 
where else on earth will you wanna go ? 
we can leave all this hate before it 's too late . 
why will we wanna come back at all ? 
cobweb on me pillow , i 'm find in the willow . 
i 'd spend me whole life sleep . 
to be call by noon be to be call too soon today . 
the storm be pass , there be peace at last . 
i 'll spend me whole life sleep . 
now there 's not a sound , no one to be find anywhere . 
the shepherd and he sheep will wind you to sleep. where else on earth will you wanna go to a land of wonder when you go under ? 
why will we want to come back at all ?
