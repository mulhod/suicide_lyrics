#angelique angelique , you name be whisper by the pass breeze . 
proclaim you beauty to the tall tree . 
and you 're me , angelique . 
angelique , you stand alone because none compare with you . 
so far from this who try to be with you . 
and you 're me , angelique . 
angelique , you kiss be only like the morning dew . 
you smile , the whole wide world , it smile with you . 
and you 're me , angelique . 
and you 're me , angelique . 
i 'll never be with you , never ever touch you hand . 
so i 'll just dream of you , lonely in me wonder land . 
angelique , when will i ever meet a girl like you ? 
and if i do , how will i know it 's true , this you 're me , angelique ?
