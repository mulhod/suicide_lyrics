#sweet love friendship if you look out from some high , high window , you will see the sun set beyond the town . 
you will see the rook to the tree-tops scream , and the wing of even come fold down . 
between the morning and the even , between the springtime and the winter drear , there come a time of new beginning , when sweet love friendship drive away all fear . 
there be many here they know naught but sorrow , and like the beast they live from day to day . 
but we can think on a bright tomorrow since sweet love friendship drive all grief away . 
all hope in prison , it soon will smother if none will with you you sorrow share . 
but we cling fast to one each other and sweet love friendship banish despair . 
just like the sailor when he ship make harbor , just like the traveller who find an inn , what care they if the wind blow hard when they be safe and warm within ? 
no lonely convict can resist the darkness , just as no sailor can the drive rain . 
but find a comrade for to share you fastness and sweet love friendship will ease you pain . 
so if you look out from some high , high window , and see the sun set beyond the sky . 
you need not mourn at the come shadow if some love friend be stand nigh .
