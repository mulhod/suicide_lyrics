i 'm a thief and i dig it ! 
oh , jawbone , why do n't you sit and moan ? 
oh , jawbone , you know this it 's stone for stone . 
sneak through the night upon you toe . 
to look in you eye , it never show . 
you name upon the post office wall put you on edge because they write it too small ! 
oh , jawbone , revenge stay on you mind . 
oh , jawbone , you be do too much time . 
pull off a job with an inside man who need the cash and like you plan . 
then you will know just who to thank when you land right back in the tank . 
oh , jawbone , why do n't you go home ? 
oh , jawbone , where be it you belong ?
