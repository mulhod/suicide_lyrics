# the humane turnkey ( 2nd ) now when i come to london , have ride two hundred mile , to see a turnkey nurse a babe , it cause the crowd to smile . 
but hear it sad history , it make the crowd to groan , and many a worthy citizen swear justice will be do . 
then up and speak a gentleman and loudly do declare this only one man in the land can settle the affair . 
so to lord sydney 's house i wend , the crowd do follow on , for they swear they will see charity before the day be do . 
when we come to lord sydney 's house , it be the hour of nine . 
we all come burst in on he as he sit down to dine . 
he listen to me story , and he countenance be grave , then declare this ere the week be out , the family will be save . 
lord sydney write two letter and he sign they with he hand , one to plymouth , one to norwich , bid they to understand this young cabell and the baby with susannah be to go as a unite family unto this distant shear . 
now i 'm home again in norwich but some other trade i 'll seek as a coachman or a waggoner , a shopman or a sweep . 
perhaps i 'll take the shill or go wear the jacket blue . 
there 's no trade but it 's the kind , so lock and bar , adieu !
