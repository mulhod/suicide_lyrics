# the green field of england farewell to we lover and we kind relation . 
farewell to the home we love well . 
there be never an end to we tribulation , for they 've damn we like sinner to hell . 
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green field of england . 
now we 're part from you . 
the sweet fetter of love they be wrench asunder as they tear we from sweetheart and wive . 
and on some foreign shear we be sentence to wander in exile the rest of we life . 
from devon , from derby , from wiltshire and wale , from norwich , from newark and frome , we be herd together from verminous jail and like vermin be force from we home . 
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green field of england . 
now we 're part from you . 
the sweet fetter of love they be wrench asunder as they tear we from sweetheart and wive . 
and on some foreign shear we be sentence to wander in exile the rest of we life . 
there 's cheat and cut-purses and rogue with no name . 
there 's swindler and sheep-stealers bold . 
there 's poor poach fellow take nothing but game , and there 's footpad take nothing but gold ! 
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green field of england . 
now we 're part from you . 
the sweet fetter of love they be wrench asunder as they tear we from sweetheart and wive . 
and on some foreign shear we be sentence to wander in exile the rest of we life . 
there 's coiner and clipper and lady of pleasure . 
there 's dicer and drunkard and whore . 
there 's butcher and baker who deal in short measure , and a few who have break no law . 
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green field of england . 
now we 're part from you . 
the sweet fetter of love they be wrench asunder as they tear we from sweetheart and wive . 
and on some foreign shear we be sentence to wander in exile the rest of we life . 
there 's some who expect to go to the scaffold . 
there 's others who think to go free . 
but now one and all in the hulk lie shackle , and together must plough the salt sea . 
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green field of england . 
now we 're part from you . 
the sweet fetter of love they be wrench asunder as they tear we from sweetheart and wive . 
and on some foreign shear we be sentence to wander in exile the rest of we life . 
there 's some of we number be handsome and hearty . 
there 's others the voyage will mend . 
but there 's never a soul of we miserable party will live to see england again . 
here 's adieu , here 's adieu to the green field of england . 
now we 're part from you . 
the sweet fetter of love they be wrench asunder as they tear we from sweetheart and wive . 
and on some foreign shear we be sentence to wander in exile the rest of we life . 
so farewell to all judge so kind and forgive . 
farewell to you prison and cell . 
for though me must leave all this make life worth live , we be leave you bastard as well !
