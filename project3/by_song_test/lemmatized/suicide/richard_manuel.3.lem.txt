#lonesome suzie lonesome suzie never get the break . 
he 's always lose and so he sit and cry and shake . 
it 's hard just to watch he and , if i touch he , oh , poor suzie , i 'm wonder what to do . 
he just sit there hope for a friend . 
i do n't fit here , but i may have a friend to lend . 
maybe i mistake he , but i ca n't overlook he . 
must be someone who can pull he through . 
anyone who 's feel this bad can tell me what to say . 
even if he just get mad he may be well off this way . 
and where be all the understand ? 
he problem ca n't be this demand . 
why be it he look me way every time he start to cry ? 
lonesome suzie , i ca n't watch you cry no long , if you can use me until you feel a little strong . 
i guess just watch you have make me lonesome too . 
why do n't we get together ? 
what else can we do ?
