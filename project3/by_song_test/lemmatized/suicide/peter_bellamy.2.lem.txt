#us poor fellow the time they be hard and the wage be poor . 
none of we poor fellow have money in store . 
so how can a good man keep the wolf from the door ? 
poor fellow , we all will go down . 
when work it be scarce , tell me , how can we eat ? 
how can we afford to buy shoe for we foot ? 
and how can we get clothe to keep off the sleet ? 
poor fellow , we may as well drown . 
if we can find labor we never will complain . 
we 'd work well for a master , he favour to gain . 
we 'd be honest and faithful with never a stain . 
but , poor fellow , how will we survive ? 
we can plough the good land . 
we can fish the salt sea . 
we can work in the woodland fell of tree . 
but when only the breath of we body be free , poor fellow , can we stay alive ? 
now a man this be single , he 's free of all care . 
he can soon leave a district if no work be there . 
there 's no manner of hardship this he can bear . 
poor fellow , if he be alone . 
but a man with a family , he hand they be tie . 
he must look to they comfort or lose all he pride . 
he ca n't wander away but must stay by they side , poor fellow , and maintain he home . 
oh a man this be will ca n't understand why he can find no employment , how hard he may try . 
and it break he poor heart for to see he wife cry , so poor fellow , he 'll do what he can . 
and a man this be desperate and ca n't find a job , he will not be contend to sit home and sob . 
be he ever so honest , he 'll turn out and rob , poor fellow , to prove he 's a man . 
if a good man go rob , you know it 's a shame . 
he bring scorn and misfortune on he honest name . 
but it pitiful strait , tell me , who be to blame ? 
poor fellow , you know he must try . 
so let 's hope this this hard time they soon pass away . 
all unto we sweet saviour we earnestly pray this this dark , cloudy morn bring a glorious day . 
poor fellow , sometime ere we die .
