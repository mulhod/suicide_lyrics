#king of the load

he 's the king of the road , the old man , the child .
the joker running wild , making it funny .
he 's of no fixed abode .
when he carries the load , he 'll do anything he can to make it funny .
but he 'll never say die if he 's living a lie .
pick up his hat and go .
if there 's reason to cry , he 'll just make it a sigh , and wander on down the road .
he 's a natural friend with the money to lend , or whatever it takes to turn you on , too .
he 's the father , the son .
he do n't owe anyone .
all his debts are all paid with his confection .
then he 'll wander away with no time in his way .
pick up his hat and go .
he 'll never say die if he 's living a lie .
just wander on down the road , wander on down the road .
and he 'll wander away with no time in his way .
pick up his hat and go .
he never said die .
he was living a lie .
just wandered on down the road , wandered on down the road , wandered on down the road .
