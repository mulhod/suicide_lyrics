#sweet loving friendship

if you look out from some high , high window , you will see the sun set beyond the town .
you will see the rooks to the tree-tops screaming , and the wing of evening come folding down .
between the morning and the evening , between the springtime and the winter drear , there comes a time of new beginnings , when sweet loving friendship drives away all fear .
there is many here they know naught but sorrow , and like the beasts they live from day to day .
but we can think on a bright tomorrow since sweet loving friendship drives all grief away .
all hope in prison , it soon will smother if none will with you your sorrow share .
but we cling fast to one each other and sweet loving friendship banishes despair .
just like the sailor when his ship makes harbor , just like the traveller who finds an inn , what care they if the wind blows harder when they be safe and warm within ?
no lonely convict can resist the darkness , just as no sailor can the driving rain .
but find a comrade for to share your fastness and sweet loving friendship will ease your pain .
so if you look out from some high , high window , and see the sun set beyond the sky .
you need not mourn at the coming shadow if some loving friend is standing nigh .
