# the leaves in the woodland

oh the grass in the meadow , the reeds by the mere , the sad boom of the bittern is all that i hear .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall sit by your loved ones no more .
when i was a young girl the world did seem gay , but these cruel hard times do drive comfort away .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall dance with your sweetheart no more .
once i gathered wild flowers in the sweet countryside , but my garlands have withered .
my posies have died .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall lie by your husband no more .
once i went a-courting , but now my man 's gone .
once i was a mother , but now i 'm alone .
and the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : you never shall walk with your menfolk no more .
come all you young women that 's free from all care .
do n't you ever get married , all sorrows lies there .
for the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry : the heart that is given no man may restore .
now the fields are all empty .
the hedgerows are bare .
only wild desolation is all i find there .
i 'll go down to the river to ease all my pain , and who knows , but i might find my dear ones again .
