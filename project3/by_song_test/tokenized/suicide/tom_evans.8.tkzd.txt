#sing for the song

words wo n't come together , and they 're very hard to me .
peace of mind is all i have to win .
tuning does n't matter just as long as i can sing .
get myself together for the song , and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
yes , we 'll all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
now , i get to feeling that it may be just a dream .
may be just another foolish game .
as long as we all sing it when we have no time to think .
have no time for bringing down our friends .
and we can all sing , sing for the song .
yes , we 'll all bring , bring it along .
yes , we 'll all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
and we can all sing , sing for the song , and we 'll all bring , bring it along .
