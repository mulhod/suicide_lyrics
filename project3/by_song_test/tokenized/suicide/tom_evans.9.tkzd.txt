#blind owl

lies , ties , mr . cool disguise .
hang it up .
get up on your own .
pill-driven skills , weeping whip-poor-wills .
too much going around that you ca n't hide .
look out for the blind owl .
you can only find that you were wrong .
no one else around me ever loved me like you do , so i 'll be strong .
look out for the blind owl .
you can only find that you were wrong .
no one else around me ever loved me like you do , so i 'll be strong .
days , plays , interviewer 's maze .
play the role .
sell your soul .
becoming to yourself , a hero who must never lie .
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
who must never lie ?
