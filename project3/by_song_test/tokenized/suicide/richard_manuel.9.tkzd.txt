#sleeping

for the life we chose in the evening we rose just long enough to be lovers again and for nothing more .
the world was too sore to live in .
sad old ships , a morning eclipse .
i spent my whole life guessing .
then i turned from the sun and saw everyone searching .
the hoot owl and his song will bring you along .
where else on earth would you wanna go ?
we can leave all this hate before it 's too late .
why would we wanna come back at all ?
cobwebs on my pillow , i 'm found in the willow .
i 'd spend my whole life sleeping .
to be called by noon is to be called too soon today .
the storm is passed , there is peace at last .
i 'll spend my whole life sleeping .
now there 's not a sound , no one to be found anywhere .
the shepherd and his sheep will wind you to sleep.
where else on earth would you wanna go to a land of wonder when you go under ?
why would we want to come back at all ?
