# the still and silent ocean

across the still and the silent ocean our ship she finds her way alone .
the crew they make no loud commotion .
the chained transports they make no moan .
all black despair do lie behind us , and what awaits us no man may know .
of those dark days naught can remind us .
new worlds are waiting to which we go .
are we in chains ?
we do not feel them .
are we ill-quartered ?
we do n't complain .
do we have guards ?
we do not see them .
do we have sickness ?
we fell no pain .
for the night is passed .
new days are dawning .
winter is over , and spring draws nigh .
what 's done is done .
there 's no time for mourning .
what 's lost is lost , and there 's no time to sigh .
god bless those tender-hearted creatures who brought us back to our own again .
good health to all whose kind deeds did reach us .
good luck to them who did ease our pain .
glad fortune come to mrs . jackson , to bold john simpson and lord sydney too .
almighty god , do spare and keep them , and grant them peace when their days are through .
come all you poor benighted convicts .
come join us in our present joy .
come all you seamen who sail the tropics .
rejoice with us that our goal is nigh .
when we 're ashore the priest will wed us , as soon as we do reach the strand .
salute the captain who here has led us to the hopeful pastures of van diemen 's land !
