#us poor fellows

the times they are hard and the wages are poor .
none of us poor fellows has money in store .
so how can a good man keep the wolf from the door ?
poor fellows , we all will go down .
when work it is scarce , tell me , how can we eat ?
how can we afford to buy shoes for our feet ?
and how can we get clothing to keep off the sleet ?
poor fellows , we might as well drown .
if we could find labor we never would complain .
we 'd work well for a master , his favour to gain .
we 'd be honest and faithful with never a stain .
but , poor fellows , how will we survive ?
we could plough the good land .
we could fish the salt sea .
we could work in the woodland felling of trees .
but when only the breath of our bodies is free , poor fellows , can we stay alive ?
now a man that is single , he 's free of all care .
he can soon leave a district if no work be there .
there 's no manner of hardship that he cannot bear .
poor fellows , if he is alone .
but a man with a family , his hands they are tied .
he must look to their comfort or lose all his pride .
he ca n't wander away but must stay by their side , poor fellows , and maintain his home .
oh a man that is willing ca n't understand why he can find no employment , how hard he may try .
and it break his poor heart for to see his wife cry , so poor fellow , he 'll do what he can .
and a man that is desperate and ca n't find a job , he will not be contended to sit home and sob .
be he ever so honest , he 'll turn out and rob , poor fellow , to prove he 's a man .
if a good man goes robbing , you know it 's a shame .
he brings scorn and misfortune on his honest name .
but it pitiful straits , tell me , who is to blame ?
poor fellow , you know he must try .
so let 's hope that these hard times they soon pass away .
all unto our sweet saviour we earnestly pray that this dark , cloudy morn brings a glorious day .
poor fellows , sometime ere we die .
