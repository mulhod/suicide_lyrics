#on my way

ballerina , trapped between the walls of her own home .
oh , god , kristina , do n't once think that this madness is my fault alone .
now her nightmare 's in her hands .
still every day 's another chance .
i 'm on my way .
i 'm on my way .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
spinning one beat until i finally realize how busy i am .
we 're both so broken , and all i 'm long hoping is that we 'll stumble upon our love again .
just believe in me , kristina .
all these demons , i can beat them .
i 'm on my way .
i 'm on my way .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
i caught you dancing quietly .
it felt like being somebody else .
oh , my friend , it seems like our love is too lovely for everyone else .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
i 'm on my way .
i 'm on my way .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
