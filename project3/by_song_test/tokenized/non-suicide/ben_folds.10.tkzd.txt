#time

think of me any way you want .
i can be the problem if that 's easier .
in your head , move the pieces around , things i 've said .
turn the memory upside down and it makes it better , i know , but sometimes it 's hard to swallow .
in time , i will fade away .
in time , i wo n't hear what you 're saying .
in time , but time takes time , you know .
tell your friends the things they want to hear and see .
start the drums .
band against the enemy and in time i will fade away .
in time , i wo n't care what you 're saying .
in time , but time takes time , you know .
in your head , move the pieces around , things i 've said .
turn the memory upside down .
it might make it better , i know , but sometimes it 's hard to swallow .
in time , i will fade away .
in time , i wo n't care what you 're saying .
in time , but time takes time , you know .
time takes time you know .
