#constant conversations

well , you 're wrapped up in a blanket and you 're staring at the floor .
the conversation 's moderated by the noisy streets below .
i never want to hurt you , baby .
i 'm just a mess with a name and a price and now i 'm drunker than before .
they told me drinking does n't make me nice .
you never know where some people will go .
yeah , some people been hurting me .
you can tell by a look , by the slightest crook in the neck or the blink of an eye .
well , then , they 'll see what they see , and they 'll do what they 'll do , but that does n't mean a goddamn thing .
you can listen if you want .
you can listen if you do n't .
yeah , they 'll talk .
yeah , they 'll even sing .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , they come singing through the window , singing through the trees .
yeah , they 're singing trough the bright spring leaves .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , yeah , they love you when they need you , but someday you 're going to need to find some other kind of place to go , oh .
now you 're standing in the kitchen , and you 're pouring out my drink .
well , there 's a very obvious difference , and it 's that one of us can think .
if there 's a bump in the road , yeah , you fix it , but for me i 'll just run off the road .
but tonight you 've got me cornered , and i have n't got a place to go .
you never know where some people will go .
yeah , some people been hurting me .
you can tell by a look , by the slightest crook in the neck or the blink of an eye .
well , then , they 'll see what they see , and they 'll do what they 'll do , but that does n't mean a goddamn thing .
you can listen if you want .
you can listen if you do n't .
yeah , they 'll talk .
yeah , they 'll even sing .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , they come singing through the window , singing through the trees .
yeah , they 're singing through the bright spring leaves .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , sing it loud , sing it loud .
yeah , they love you when they need you , but someday you 're going to need to find some other kind of place to go , do n't you know , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ?
