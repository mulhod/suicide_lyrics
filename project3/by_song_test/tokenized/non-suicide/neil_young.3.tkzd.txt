# the needle and the damage done

i caught you knocking at my cellar door .
i love you , baby .
can i have some more ?
ooh , ooh , the damage done .
i hit the city and i lost my band .
i watched the needle take another man .
gone , gone , the damage done .
i sing the song because i love the man .
i know that some of you do n't understand .
milk blood to keep from running out .
i 've seen the needle and the damage done , a little part of it in everyone .
but every junkie 's like a setting sun .
