#sentimental guy

there 's a moment in my mind i scribbled and erased a thousand times like a letter never written or sent .
these conversations with the dead .
i used to be a sentimental guy .
now i 'm haunted by the left unsaid .
i never thought so much could change .
little things you said or did are part of me , come out from time to time .
probably no one i know now would notice .
but i never thought so much could change .
you drifted far away , far away it seems .
time has stopped , the clock keeps going .
people talking and i 'm watching as flashes of their faces go black and white and fade to yellow in a box in an attic .
but i never thought so much could change .
now i do n't miss anyone .
i do n't miss anything .
what a shame because i used to be a sentimental guy .
