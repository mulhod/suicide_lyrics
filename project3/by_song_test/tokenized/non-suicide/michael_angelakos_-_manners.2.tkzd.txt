#little secrets

when i came down , the dawn poured into me .
i shook them up , the walls came crumbling , my thin skin trembling with these salty wounds , my stolen gold inside the emperor 's tomb .
now painting rainbows on my ugly face .
i built this cardboard neighborhood 's disgrace .
but i ascend and serve my feverish need within the confines of such chemistry .
it 's the way i see everything i need .
it 's no way to be .
let this be our little secret .
no one needs to know we 're feeling higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me .
up and up we keep on climbing , higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
my face blew up at such a casual sight , the smattered colors of ecstatic fright , the rush above me to oblivion , outlining wet sidewalks in halogen .
oh , have you ever felt so goddamn strong ?
how come it takes some people so damn long ?
he turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain .
the citrus drawing out the scene in stains .
watch the basin drain as your life lines wane and you ca n't explain as your friends complain .
you 've caused all this pain and you proudly shame your whole family 's name .
let this be our little secret .
no one needs to know we 're feeling higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me .
up and up we keep on climbing , higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
mother , i can tell what you 've been thinking , staring at the stars on your ceiling , thinking once there was a power that you were wielding .
but now i 've hit the mark , stabbing at the dark , and i cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars .
let this be our little secret .
no one needs to know we 're feeling higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
but i feel alive , oh , i feel it in me .
up and up we keep on climbing , higher and higher and higher , higher and higher and higher .
