#mind games

we 're playing those mind games together , pushing the barriers , planting seeds , playing the mind guerrilla , chanting the mantra peace on earth .
we all been playing those mind games forever , some kind of druid dudes lifting the veil , doing the mind guerrilla .
some call it magic , the search for the grail .
love is the answer and you know that for sure .
love is a flower .
you got to let it grow .
so keep on playing those mind games together , faith in the future out of the now .
you just ca n't beat on those mind guerrillas , absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind .
yeah , we 're playing those mind games together , projecting our images in space and in time .
yes is the answer and you know that for sure .
yes is surrender .
you got to let it go .
so keep on playing those mind games together , doing the ritual dance in the sun , millions of mind guerrillas putting their soul power to the karmic wheel .
keep on playing those mind games together , raising the spirit of peace and love .
i want you to make love , not war .
i know you 've heard it before .
