#going back

in a foreign land there were creatures at play , running hand in hand , needing nowhere to stay , driven to the mountains high , they were sunken in the cities deep , living in my sleep.
i feel like going back , back where there 's nowhere to stay , when fire filled the sky .
i 'll still remember that day .
these rocks i 'm climbing down have already left the ground , careening through space .
i used to build these buildings .
i used to walk next to you .
their shadows tore us apart and now we do what we do .
driven to the mountains high , sunken in the cities deep , living in our sleep.
i feel like going back , back where there 's nowhere to stay .
