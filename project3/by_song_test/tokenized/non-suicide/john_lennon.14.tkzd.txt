#out the blue

out the blue you came to me and blew away life 's misery , out the blue life 's energy , out the blue you came to me .
every day i thank the lord and lady for the way that you came to me .
anyway , it had to be two minds , one destiny .
out the blue you came to me and blew away life 's misery , out the blue life 's energy , out the blue you came to me .
all my life 's been a long slow knife .
i was born just to get to you .
anyway , i survived long enough to make you my wife .
out the blue you came to me and blew away life 's misery , out the blue life 's energy , out the blue you came to me .
like a u.f.o . you came to me and blew away life 's misery , out the blue life 's energy , out the blue you came to me .
