#how do you sleep ?

so sergeant pepper took you by surprise .
you better see right through that mother 's eyes .
those freaks was right when they said you was dead .
the one mistake you made was in your head .
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
you live with straights who tell you you was king , jump when your mama tell you anything .
the only thing you done was yesterday and , since you 're gone , you 're just another day .
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
a pretty face may last a year or two , but pretty soon they 'll see what you can do .
the sound you make is muzak to my ears .
you must have learned something in all those years .
ah , how do you sleep ?
ah , how do you sleep at night ?
