#crippled inside

you can shine your shoes and wear a suit .
you can comb your hair and look quite cute .
you can hide your face behind a smile .
one thing you ca n't hide is when you 're crippled inside .
you can wear a mask and paint your face .
you can call yourself the human race .
you can wear a collar and a tie .
one thing you ca n't hide is when you 're crippled inside .
well , now , you know that your cat has nine lives , nine lives to itself , but you only got one and a dog 's life ai n't fun .
mama , take a look outside .
you can go to church and sing a hymn .
you can judge me by the color of my skin .
you can live a lie until you die .
one thing you ca n't hide is when you 're crippled inside .
