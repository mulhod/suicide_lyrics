#seaweed song

some day you 'll see , surrounded by angels , floating atop of the sea .
abandon me .
do n't go where they go .
do n't sing all the songs they sing .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do . but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
between these walls her back , strange glimpse , casts shadows frighteningly tall .
i slow to a crawl .
i jump and i yell , but she hears nothing at all .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , ut i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
stay , stay the same beause everything else will change and i 've always been to blame , so please just stay the same .
the currents pull me in .
the tide has reached my chin .
the seaweed tickles skin .
just let the water win .
i 'm freezing to the bone .
you 'll never be at home .
just watch , you 're running out .
just watch your body go .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
nobody knows you the way you know you , but i think i do , but i thought i knew .
yeah , i thought i knew .
