take a walk

all these kinds of places make it seem like it 's been ages .
tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky .
i love this country dearly , i can feel the ladder clearly , but i never thought i 'd be alone to try .
once i was outside penn station selling red and white carnations .
we were still alone , my wife and i , before we married , saved my money , brought my dear wife over .
now i work to bring my family stateside , but off the boat they stayed awhile , then scattered across the coast .
once a year i 'll see them for a week or so at most .
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
practice is n't perfect , but the market cuts the loss .
i remind myself that times could be much worse .
my wife wo n't ask me questions .
there 's not so much to ask and she 'll never flaunt around an empty purse .
once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights , then decided she would stay the rest of her life .
i watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen and i sit and pray they never feel my strife .
but then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone .
he made some bad investments .
now the accounts are overdrawn .
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
honey , it 's your son .
i think i borrowed just too much .
we had taxes , we had bills , we had a lifestyle to front and tonight i swear i 'll come home and we 'll make love like we 're young and tomorrow you 'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids .
we can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes , but see i am no criminal .
i 'm down on both bad knees .
i 'm just too much a coward to admit when i 'm in need .
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
