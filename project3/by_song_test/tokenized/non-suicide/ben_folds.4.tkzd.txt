#landed

we 'd hit the bottom .
i thought it was my fault and in a way i guess it was .
i 'm just now finding out what it was all about .
we 'd moved to the west coast , away from everyone .
she never told me that you called back when i was still , i was still in love till i opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
and i twisted it wrong just to make it right , had to leave myself behind .
and i 've been flying high all night , so come pick me up .
i 've landed .
the daily dramas she made from nothing , so nothing ever made it right .
she liked to push me and talk me back down till i believed i was the crazy one , and in a way i guess i was .
well i opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
dragging the sea of a troubled mind , had to leave myself behind .
singing bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
if you wrote me off , i 'd understand it because i 've been on some other planet , so come pick me up .
i 've landed .
and you will be so happy to know i 've come alone .
it 's over .
well i opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
down comes the reign of the telephone czar .
it 's okay to call and i will answer for myself .
come pick me up .
come pick me up .
i 've landed .
