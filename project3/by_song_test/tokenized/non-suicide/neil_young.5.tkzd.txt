#comes a time

comes a time when you 're drifting , comes a time when you settle down .
comes a light , feelings lifting .
lift that baby right up off the ground .
oh , this old world keeps spinning around .
it 's a wonder tall trees ai n't laying down .
there comes a time .
you and i , we were captured .
we took our souls and we flew away .
we were right , we were giving .
that 's how we kept what we gave away .
oh , this old world keeps spinning around .
it 's a wonder tall trees ai n't laying down .
there comes a time .
