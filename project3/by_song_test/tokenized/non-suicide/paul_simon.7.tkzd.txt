she said he was a most peculiar man .
he was a most peculiar man .
he lived all alone within a house , within a room , within himself .
a most peculiar man .
he had no friends ; he seldom spoke .
and no one in turn ever spoke to him because he was n't friendly and he did n't care , and he was n't like them .
oh , no!
he was a most peculiar man .
he died last saturday .
he turned on the gas and he went to sleep with the windows closed so he 'd never wake up to his silent world and his tiny room .
and mrs . riordan says he has a brother somewhere who should be notified soon .
and all the people said , "what a shame that he 's dead , but was n't he a most peculiar man ? "
