#look up

look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
look up .
look up .
he 's the life waiting to love you , wanting to reach you .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
the man walking down the street keeps his head down low .
does n't look up , wants to give up .
he just keeps on looking down , staring at the ground .
standing here at the corner i 'm watching him walk away .
standing here and i do n't know why , but i 'm thinking it could be a great day .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
oh , i wish you knew him .
he 's been waiting for so long .
if you look up , you 'll see him .
you know we 're all alone .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
look up .
look up .
he 's the life waiting to love you , wanting to reach you .
look up .
look up .
you 'll see the sky .
