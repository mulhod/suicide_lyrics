#leaves that are green

i was twenty-one years when i wrote this song .
i 'm twenty-two now but i wo n't be for long .
time hurries on .
and the leaves that are green turn to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
once my heart was filled with the love of a girl .
i held her close , but she faded in the night like a poem i meant to write .
and the leaves that are green turn to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
i threw a pebble in a brook .
and watched the ripples run away .
and they never made a sound .
and the leaves that are green turn to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
hello , hello , hello , hello .
good-bye , good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
that 's all there is .
and the leaves that are green turned to brown .
and they wither with the wind .
and they crumble in your hand .
