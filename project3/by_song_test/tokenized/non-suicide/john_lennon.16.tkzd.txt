#i know ( i know )

the years have passed so quickly .
one thing i 've understood : i am only learning to tell the trees from wood .
i know what 's coming down and i know where it 's coming from and i know and i 'm sorry , yes , i am , but i never could speak my mind .
and i know just how you feel and i know now what i have done and i know and i 'm guilty , but i never could speak my mind .
i know what i was missing , but now my eyes can see .
i put myself in your place as you did for me .
today i love you more than yesterday .
right now i love you more right now .
now i know what 's coming down .
i can feel where it 's coming from and i know it 's getting better all the time as we share in each other 's minds .
