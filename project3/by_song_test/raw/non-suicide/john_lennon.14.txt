#Out the Blue

Out the blue you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me .
Every day I thank the Lord and Lady for the way that you came to me.
Anyway, it had to be two minds, one destiny .
Out the blue you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me .
All my life's been a long slow knife.
I was born just to get to you.
Anyway, I survived long enough to make you my wife .
Out the blue you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me .
Like a U.F.O. you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me.
