#Going Down on Love

Got to get down, down on my knees.
Got to get down, down on my knees.
Going down on love.
Going down on love.
Going down, going down, going down.
When the real thing goes wrong and you can't get it on and your love, she has gone and you got to carry on and you shoot out the light, ain't coming home for the night, you know you got to, got to, got to pay the price.
Somebody please, please help me.
You know I'm drowning in the sea of hatred.
Got to get down, down on my knees.
Got to get down, down on my knees.
Going down on love.
Going down on love.
Going down, going down, going down.
Something precious and rare disappears in thin air and it seems so unfair.
Nothing doing nowhere.
Well, you burn all your boats and you sow your wild oats.
Well, you know, you know, you know the price is right!
