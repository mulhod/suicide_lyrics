#Get Away

I know what it is you're thinking, but baby, it's sacred to me.
Whenever I feel like I'm sinking, you make a beautiful scene.
You don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
Baby, I'm feeling low.
Don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't know what you're putting me through.
Once in a while you're lonely.
If you feel lonely, cry.
I'd love to know what is the matter, unless you're with some other guy, because you don't lie to me and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
Baby, I'm feeling low.
Don't know what I'm going to do.
You don't know what you're putting me through.
Do you want to?
I want you.
Do you want to?
I want you too.
Don't you know I'm losing sleep at night, sleep at night?
Don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't know what you're putting me through.
I know what it is you're thinking, but baby, it's strange to me.
Whenever I feel like I'm sinking, you make a beautiful scene.
Don't lie to me, and I wouldn't lie to you, oh, no.
And, baby, I'm feeling low.
Don't know what I'm going to do.
Don't know what you're putting me through.
