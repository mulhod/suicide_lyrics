#Landed

We'd hit the bottom.
I thought it was my fault and in a way I guess it was.
I'm just now finding out what it was all about.
We'd moved to the west coast, away from everyone.
She never told me that you called back when I was still, I was still in love till I opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down, and it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right, had to leave myself behind.
And I've been flying high all night, so come pick me up.
I've landed.
The daily dramas she made from nothing, so nothing ever made it right.
She liked to push me and talk me back down till I believed I was the crazy one, and in a way I guess I was.
Well I opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down, and it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
Dragging the sea of a troubled mind, had to leave myself behind.
Singing bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
If you wrote me off, I'd understand it because I've been on some other planet, so come pick me up.
I've landed.
And you will be so happy to know I've come alone.
It's over.
Well I opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down, and it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried.
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar.
It's okay to call and I will answer for myself.
Come pick me up.
Come pick me up.
I've landed.
