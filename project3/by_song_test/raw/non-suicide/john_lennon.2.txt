#Instant Karma!

Instant Karma's going to get you, going to knock you right in the head.
You'd better get yourself together.
Pretty soon you're going to be dead.
What in the world're you thinking of, laughing in the face of love?
What on Earth you trying to do?
It's up to you, yeah, you.
Instant Karma's going to get you, going to knock you right in the face.
You better get yourself together, darling, join the human race.
How in the world're you going to see, laughing at fools like me.
Who on Earth do you think you are, a superstar? 
Well, right you are.
And we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Well, we all shine on, everyone, come on.
Instant Karma's going to get you, going to knock you off your feet.
Better recognize your brothers, everyone you meet.
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear.
Why on Earth are you there when you're everywhere, going to get your share?
Well, we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on.
Come on and on and on, on, on.
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Well, we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on, on and on and on, on and on.
And we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Well, we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on, like the moons and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on, like the moon and the stars and the sun.
