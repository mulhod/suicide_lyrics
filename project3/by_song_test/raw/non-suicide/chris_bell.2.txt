#Better Save Yourself

I'm off the street. 
I'm all alone. 
I just can't think what I've been doing wrong. 
I know you're mine. 
He treats you nice. 
It's suicide. 
I know, I tried it twice. 
You should've given your love to Jesus. 
It couldn't do you no harm. 
Should've given your love to Jesus. 
It wouldn't do you no harm. 
You've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace, but you better save yourself If you want to see his face.
I guess there are things you'd like to know.
It's getting late, and I know you want to go. 
You should've given your love to Jesus. 
It couldn't do you no harm. 
Should've given your love to Jesus. 
It wouldn't do you no harm. 
You've been sitting on your ass trying to find some grace, but you better save yourself if you want to see his face. 
I'm off the street. 
I'm all alone. 
I just can't think what I've been doing wrong.
