#On My Way

Ballerina, trapped between the walls of her own home.
Oh, God, Kristina, don't once think that this madness is my fault alone.
Now her nightmare's in her hands.
Still every day's another chance.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Let's get married.
I'll buy a ring and then we'll consecrate this messy love.
Spinning one beat until I finally realize how busy I am.
We're both so broken, and all I'm long hoping is that we'll stumble upon our love again.
Just believe in me, Kristina.
All these demons, I can beat them.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Let's get married.
I'll buy a ring and then we'll consecrate this messy love.
I caught you dancing quietly.
It felt like being somebody else.
Oh, my friend, it seems like our love is too lovely for everyone else.
Let's get married.
I'll buy a ring and then we'll consecrate this messy love.
I'm on my way.
I'm on my way.
Let's get married.
I'll buy a ring and then we'll consecrate this messy love.
