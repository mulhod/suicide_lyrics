#Only People

Let's go.
Only people know just how to talk to people.
Only people know just how to change the world.
Only people realize the power of people.
Well, a million heads are better than one.
So come on, get it on.
Well, I know how we tried, the millions of tears that we cried.
Now we are hipper we been through the trip and we can't be denied with woman and man side by side.
Make no mistake: it's our future we're making.
Bake the cake and eat it, too.
We don't want no pig brother scene.
Only people know just how to talk to people.
Only people know just how to change the world.
Only people realize the power of people.
Well, a million heads are better than one.
So come on, get it on.
Well, it's long overdue.
there ain't nothing better to do.
Now we are hipper we been through the trip.
We can fly right on through.
there's nothing on earth we can't do.
Fish or cut bait.
it's our future we're making.
All together now pull the chain.
We don't want no pig brother scene.
Only people know just how to talk to people.
Only people know just how to change the world.
Only people know just how to talk to people.
Only people know just how to change the world.
Only people know just how to talk to people.
Only people know just how to change the world.
Only people know just how to talk to people.
Only people know just how to change the world.
