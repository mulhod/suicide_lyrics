#Where We Belong

It's gotten cold in here, but a solemn warmth draws near and with a gentle touch all these burdens and such fears are wiped clear.
Who says you ought to stay?
How's this the easier way?
It's far from giving up.
Cowards never say enough is enough.
And then I'm lifted up out of the crimson tub
The bath begins to drain and from the floor he prays away all my pain.
Who says that God exists?
We can't see icons or myths, but, well, I believe in you.
Do you believe in me, too, Gabriel?
All the things you can't control should never destroy the love one holds.
I found a place, I found a place, I found a place where we belong.
Never be up and down, be in between the whitest clouds.
Never did I ever think I'd find all the things I've found because how you keep on living when you're always but a million down.
All I've ever wanted was to be happy and make you proud.
