#Sentimental Guy

There's a moment in my mind I scribbled and erased a thousand times like a letter never written or sent.
These conversations with the dead.
I used to be a sentimental guy.
Now I'm haunted by the left unsaid.
I never thought so much could change.
Little things you said or did are part of me, come out from time to time.
Probably no one I know now would notice.
But I never thought so much could change.
You drifted far away, far away it seems.
Time has stopped, the clock keeps going.
People talking and I'm watching as flashes of their faces go black and white and fade to yellow in a box in an attic.
But I never thought so much could change.
Now I don't miss anyone.
I don't miss anything.
What a shame because I used to be a sentimental guy.
