I Am The Cosmos

Every night I tell myself: "I am the cosmos, I am the wind," but that don't get you back again.
Just when I was starting to feel okay, you're on the phone.
I never want to be alone never want to be alone.
I hate to have to take you home. 
Wanted too much to say no, no. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, never want to be alone.
I hate to have to take you home. 
Want you too much to say no, no. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, my feeling's always happening, something I couldn't hide. 
I can't confide. 
Don't know what's going on inside. 
So every night I tell myself: "I am the cosmos, I am the wind," but that don't get you back again. 
I'd really like to see you again. 
I really want to see you again. 
I'd really like to see you again. 
I really want to see you again. 
I'd really like to see you again. 
I really want to see you again. 
I never want to see you again. 
Really want to see you again.
