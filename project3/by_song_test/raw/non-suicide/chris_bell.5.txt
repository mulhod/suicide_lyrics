#You and Your Sister    

They say my love for you ain't real, but they don't know how real it feels.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
Your sister says that I'm no good.
You know I'd show her them if I could.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
Love you every day.
Let me hear you say your love won't be leaving.
Your eyes ain't deceiving.
Love you every day.
Let me hear you say: All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
And let me whisper in your ear: don't you worry, they can't hear.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
If you give me a little time, I will show you I ain't lying.
All I want to do is to spend some time with you so I can hold you, hold you.
