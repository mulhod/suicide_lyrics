#Little Secrets

When I came down, the dawn poured into me.
I shook them up, the walls came crumbling, my thin skin trembling with these salty wounds, my stolen gold inside the emperor's tomb.
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face.
I built this cardboard neighborhood's disgrace.
But I ascend and serve my feverish need within the confines of such chemistry.
It's the way I see everything I need.
It's no way to be.
Let this be our little secret.
No one needs to know we're feeling higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
But I feel alive, oh, I feel it in me.
Up and up we keep on climbing, higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
My face blew up at such a casual sight, the smattered colors of ecstatic fright, the rush above me to oblivion, outlining wet sidewalks in halogen.
Oh, have you ever felt so goddamn strong?
How come it takes some people so damn long?
He turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain.
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains.
Watch the basin drain as your life lines wane and you can't explain as your friends complain.
You've caused all this pain and you proudly shame your whole family's name.
Let this be our little secret.
No one needs to know we're feeling higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
But I feel alive, oh, I feel it in me.
Up and up we keep on climbing, higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
Mother, I can tell what you've been thinking, staring at the stars on your ceiling, thinking once there was a power that you were wielding.
But now I've hit the mark, stabbing at the dark, and I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars.
Let this be our little secret.
No one needs to know we're feeling higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
But I feel alive, oh, I feel it in me.
Up and up we keep on climbing, higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher.
