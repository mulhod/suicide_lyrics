#Orange Juice Blues (Blues for Breakfast)

I had a hard time waking this morning.
I got a lotta things on my mind, like those friends of yours.
They keep bringing me down, just hanging around all the time.
I've had a hard time waking most mornings and it's been that way for a month or more.
You've had things your way, but now I've got to say I'm on my way out the door.
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby?
You haven't been right with me.
why don't you get right, try and get right, baby?
don't you remember how it used to be?
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby?
You haven't been right with me.
why don't you get right, try and get right, baby?
don't you remember how it used to be?
You had a hard time waking this morning and I can see it in your empty eyes, but there's no need for talking or walking round the block just to figure out the reason why.
I have a hard time handing out warnings.
I'll just slide on out the door because I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful, and I ain't coming back no more.
Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby?
You haven't been right with me.
why don't you get right, try and get right, baby?
don't you remember how it used to be?
