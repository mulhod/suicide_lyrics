#Lost Horizons

The last horizons I can see are filled with bars and factories, and in them all we fight to stay awake.
Drink enough of anything to make this world look new again.
Drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves.
She had nothing left to say, so she said she loved me.
I stood there grateful for the lie.
Drink enough of anything to make this girl look new again.
Drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves.
Turn summer trees to bones and ice.
Turn insect songs against the night with words we build and words we break.
I'm drunk, drunk, drunk in the gardens and the graves.
Maybe I could use you to reassure myself.
I wouldn't wish this indecision on anybody else.
Drink enough of anything to make this world look new again.
And when the sin smiles, how could it be wrong?
The last horizons I could see are not resigned to memories.
I never thought I'd still be here today.
Drink enough of anything to make myself look new again.
Drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves.
