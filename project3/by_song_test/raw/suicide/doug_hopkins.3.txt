#Pieces of the Night 

Is it any wonder that the stars just don't rush by when you're only doing 60 through this oh so vacant night?
But it's lacking something big this time.
What the hell did you expect to find, Aphrodite on a barstool by your side?
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
And is it any wonder in the middle of the crowd you let your feet get trampled on when the music is that loud.
But you wanted to be where you are, but it looked much better from afar.
A hillside in shadow between the people and the stars.
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
It seems so distant, but still only half the night away where notions between your questions come too.
Is it any wonder where the pieces of the night have been?
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
Only pieces of the night.
Then I saw.
Only pieces of the night.
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
Then I saw: gin mill rainfall.
What do you remember if at all?
Only pieces of the night.
Twelfth night, we go after something everyone should know.
Somewhere in the distance out of sight.
