#The Plymouth Mail

The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
When I was a lad I used to play by the roadside all the live-long day, hoping always to espy the gentry's coaches rolling by.
When I was a youth I used to roam with a waggoner from town to town, but I longed to fly across the land on a stagecoach high with a four-in-hand.
Now I am grown unto a man on the driver's box I take my stand.
Like the captain bold of a ship of sail, I'm the man who drives the Plymouth Mail.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
With six on top and four inside, the post-poy and the guard beside, their bags and baggage safely stowed, it's time to take the open road.
Then the hooves do fly, and the wheels spin round and we bid adieu to Plymouth town.
Plympton, Brent, and Ashburton pass, and to Exeter we comes at last.
Then the horses blow, and their sides do steam, as the ostlers run to change the team.
The travellers gulp a glass of ale then back they scramble on the Plymouth Mail.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
We roll across the Dorset Downs and stage again in Shaftesbury town.
Then I crack my whip with might and main, and on we roll to Salisbury Plain.  
Soon over Hounslow Heath we fly where the gibbets loom against the sky.
And the passengers all hide their gold for fear we meet some robbers bold.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
At the sign of the Standard in Cornhill, at last my rumbling wheels are still.
And the passengers all stiff and sore thank God their journey's safely over.
In a cozy parlor now I stand with a goodly bumper to my hand, and the travellers drink a glass of ale to the health of the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
