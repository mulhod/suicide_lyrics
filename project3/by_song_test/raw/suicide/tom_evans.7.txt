#No Good at All

Don't let your mother see you rock.
Don't let your mother see you roll.
Don't let your mother hear you knocking.
Don't let your mother see you go.
Don't ever let her see you out of your head.
Do you no good at all.
Don't let your brother put you down.
Don't let your brother put you on.
Don't let your brother hear your barking.
Don't let your brother see you go.
Don't ever let him see you out of your head.
Do you no good at all.
