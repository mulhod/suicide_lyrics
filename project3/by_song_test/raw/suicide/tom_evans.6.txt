#It's Over

Pack my bag. 
I'm going away.
It's over.
Going home.
Thank you, people, but it's too much to stay.
It's done now.
I'm going home.
Now I feel like I'm warm.
Now I feel like I'm tuned.
Spent my time and some fun, and for that I thank you.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over. 
I'm going home.
It's over.
It's over, and for that I thank you.
Now I feel like I'm warm.
Now I feel like I'm tuned.
Spent my time and some fun, and for that I thank you.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over. 
I'm going home.
It's over.
It's over, and for that I thank you.
