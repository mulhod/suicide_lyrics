#Beautiful and Blue

She looks out of her window at the people passing by. 
They look so happy. 
Makes her cry.
She watches them laughing. 
Sees the lovers holding hands, and everyone each other's friends.
Beautiful and blue, they're not as good as you.
Beautiful and blue, they're lonely too.
She feels so unhappy.
She no longer cares for life and is close to ending all her strifes.
The world doesn't know her.
It's so hard and cold and cruel.
She wonders why she's such a fool.
Beautiful and blue.
Beautiful and blue.
