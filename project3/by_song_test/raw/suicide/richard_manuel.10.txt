#Just Another Whistle Stop

To all concerned dead or alive, the locomotive will arrive, bringing souls from all around.
They'll be bound for higher ground.
Look out, stranger, it's coming through with plenty of room for me and you and it's just another whistle stop.
If you don't quit till we reach the top, I'd be much obliged to you.
Odd man out.
you know that's the rule.
You can scream and you can shout, but they'll only call you a crazy fool.
Pay no mind to what they say.
When they're bitter, they talk that way.
I seen a young boy on the run and I seen other children having fun.
A police siren flashing light.
I wonder who went down tonight.
People, people, where do you go before you believe in what you know?
It's just another whistle stop.
If you don't quit till we reach the top, I'd be much obliged to you.
When the trolley is clean out of reach, a certain lesson it will teach.
to grind your axe until it's dull, you've got to get it in your skull.
Tell the people all across the sea, Don't turn your back because it's free.
It's just another whistle stop.
If you don't quit till we reach the top, I'd, I'd be much obliged to you.
And it's odd man out.
You know that's the rule.
You can scream and you can shout, but they'll only call you a crazy fool.
Pay no mind to what you read.
There's one way home that's guaranteed.
