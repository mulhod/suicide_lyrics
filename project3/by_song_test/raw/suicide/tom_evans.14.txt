#Lost Inside Your Love

What can I say?
What can I do?
All of my life I've been a victim of you.
What can I say or do?
Lost inside your love.
What can it be?
Who can I see?
All of your life you've been the winner in me.
What can I say or do?
Lost inside your love.
Is it any wonder, there's no reason why?
Is it all because I left it open wide for your pride, to leave me one more time?
Are you leaving me one more time?
What can I say?
What can I do?
All of my life I've been a winner with you.
What can I say or do?
Lost inside your love.
Lost inside your love.
Lost inside your love.
