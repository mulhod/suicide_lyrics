Fisherman

Between the darkness and the light, as the stars fade out of sight, I can hear his shiny boots fall on the sand.
With a basket at his side, and the morning full of pride you can see him cast his line with skillful hands.
Hey, hey, fisherman, wish you luck that's all I can.
Hey, hey, fisherman, forget the world if that's your plan.
As the morning turns to noon, he's content to sit and croon, and he lights his twisted pipe and settles down.
Onward goes the time as he tries new baited line, so he digs another worm up from the ground.
Hey, hey, fisherman, wish you luck that's all I can.
Hey, hey, fisherman, forget the world if that's your plan.
Between the nightness and the light, the line is taut.
He has a bite, and he hauls the beauty in with skillful pride.
And his patient mind is blown because the fish is overgrown.
It was really worth a day for such a prize.
Hey hey, fisherman.
