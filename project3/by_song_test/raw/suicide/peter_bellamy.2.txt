#Us Poor Fellows

The times they are hard and the wages are poor.
None of us poor fellows has money in store.
So how can a good man keep the wolf from the door?
Poor fellows, we all will go down.
When work it is scarce, tell me, how can we eat?
How can we afford to buy shoes for our feet?
And how can we get clothing to keep off the sleet?
Poor fellows, we might as well drown.
If we could find labor we never would complain.
We'd work well for a master, his favour to gain.
We'd be honest and faithful with never a stain.
But, poor fellows, how will we survive?
We could plough the good land.
We could fish the salt sea.
We could work in the woodland felling of trees.
But when only the breath of our bodies is free, poor fellows, can we stay alive?
Now a man that is single, he's free of all care.
He can soon leave a district if no work be there.
There's no manner of hardship that he cannot bear.
Poor fellows, if he is alone.
But a man with a family, his hands they are tied.
He must look to their comfort or lose all his pride.
He can't wander away but must stay by their side, poor fellows, and maintain his home.
Oh a man that is willing can't understand why he can find no employment, how hard he may try.
And it break his poor heart for to see his wife cry, so poor fellow, he'll do what he can.
And a man that is desperate and can't find a job, he will not be contended to sit home and sob.
Be he ever so honest, he'll turn out and rob, poor fellow, to prove he's a man.
If a good man goes robbing, you know it's a shame.
He brings scorn and misfortune on his honest name.
But it pitiful straits, tell me, who is to blame?
Poor fellow, you know he must try.
So let's hope that these hard times they soon pass away.
All unto our sweet saviour we earnestly pray that this dark, cloudy morn brings a glorious day.
Poor fellows, sometime ere we die.
