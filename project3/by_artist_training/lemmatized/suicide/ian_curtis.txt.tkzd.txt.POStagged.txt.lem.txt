#isolation in fear every day , every even , he call he aloud from above , carefully watch for a reason , painstaking devotion and love , surrender to self-preservation from others who care for they , a blindness this touch perfection , , but hurt just like anything else .

#passover this be a crisis i know have to come , destroy the balance i 'd keep , doubt , unsettle , and turn around , wonder what will come next . 
be this the role this you want to live ? 
i be foolish to ask for so much . 
without the protection and infancy 's guard , it all fall apart at first touch . 
watch the reel as it come to a close , brutally take it time . 
people who change for no reason at all . 
it 's happen all of the time . 
can i go on with this train of event disturb and purge me mind ? 
back out of me duty when all 's say and do . 
i know this i 'll lose every time . 
move along in we god-given way . 
safety be sit by the fire , sanctuary from this feverish smile . 
leave with a mark on the door . 
be this the gift this i want to give ? 
"forgive and forget " 's what they teach . 
or pass through the desert and wasteland once more and watch as they drop by the beach . 
this be the crisis i know have to come , destroy the balance i 'd keep , turn around to the next set of life , wonder what will come next . 
#colony a cry for help . 
a hint of anaesthesia . 
the sound from break home . 
we use to always meet here .

some thing i have to do , but i do n't mean you harm . 
a worry parent 's glance . 
a kiss . 
a last goodbye . 
hand he the bag he pack . 
the tear he try to hide . 
a cruel wind this blow down to we lunacy and leave he stand cold here in this colony . 
i ca n't see why all this confrontation . 
i ca n't see why all this dislocation . 
no family life .

#heart and soul instinct this can still betray we . 
a journey this lead to the sun . 
soulless and bend on destruction . 
a struggle between right and wrong . 
you take me place in the showdown . 
i 'll observe with a pitiful eye . 
i 'd humbly ask for forgiveness , a request well beyond you and i . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
an abyss this laugh at creation . 
a circus complete with all fool . 
foundation this last the age , then rip apart at they root . 
beyond all this good be the terror , the grip of a mercenary hand , when savagery turn all good reason . 
there 's no turn back , no last stand .

#twenty four hour so this be permanence , love 's shatter pride , what once be innocence turn on it side . 
a cloud hang over me , mark every move , deep in the memory of what once be love . 
oh , how i realize ! 
how i want time ! 
put into perspective . 
try so hard to find . 
just for one moment , think i 'd find me way . 
destiny unfold . 
i watch it slip away . 
excessive flashpoint , beyond all reach . 
solitary demand for all i 'd like to keep. let 's take a ride out . 
see what we can find . 
a valueless collection of hope and past desire . 
i never realize the length i 'd have to go , all the dark corner of a sense i do n't know . 
just for one moment , i hear somebody call . 
look beyond the day in hand . 
there 's nothing there at all . 
now this i 've realize how it 's all go wrong , get to find some therapy . 
this treatment take too long . 
deep in the heart of where sympathy hold sway , get to find me destiny before it get too late . 
# the eternal procession move on . 
the shout be over . 
praise to the glory of love one now go . 
talk aloud as they sit around they table , scatter flower wash down by the rain . 
stand by the gate at the foot of the garden , watch they pass like cloud in the sky . 
try to cry out in the heat of the moment , possess by a fury this burn from inside . 
cry like a child , though this year make me old . 
with child me time be so wastefully spend , a burden to keep , though they inner communion . 
accept like a curse , an unlucky deal . 
play by the gate at the foot of the garden . 
me view stretch out from the fence to the wall . 
no word can explain . 
no action determine . 
just watch the tree and the leave as they fall . 
#decades here be the young man , the weight on they shoulder . 
here be the young man . 
well , where have they be ? 
we knock on the door of hell 's dark chamber . 
push to the limit , we drag we in . 
watch from the wing as the scene be replay . 
we see we now as we never have see . 
portrayal of the trauma and degeneration , the sorrow we suffer and never be free . 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
weary inside , now we heart 's lose forever . 
ca n't replace the fear or the thrill of the chase . 
each ritual show up . 
the door for we wandering open , then shut , then slam in we face . 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ? 
where have they be ?

#warsaw i be there in the backstage when the first light come around .

i can see all the weakness . 
i pick all the fault . 
well , i concede all the faith test just to stick in you throat . 
31g , 31g , 31g . 
i hang around in you soundtrack to mirror all this you 've do , to find the right side of reason , to kill the three lie for one . 
i can see all the cold fact . 
i can see through you eye . 
all this talk make no contact no matter how hard we try . 
31g , 31g , 31g . 
i can still hear the footstep . 
i can see only wall . 
i slide into you man-traps with no hear at all . 
i just see contradiction , have to give up the fight just to live in the past tense , to make believe you be right . 
31g , 31g , 31g . 
#leaders of man bear from some mother 's womb , just like any other room . 
make a promise for a new life . 
make a victim out of you life . 
when you time 's on the door and it drip to the floor and you feel you can touch , all the noise be too much and the seed this be sow be no long you own . 
just a minor operation to force a final ultimatum . 
thousand word be speak loud reach the dumb to fool the crowd . 
when you walk down the street and the sound 's not so sweet and you wish you can hide , maybe go for a ride to some peep-show arcade , where the future 's not make . 
a nightmare situation infiltrate imagination , smack of past holy war by the wall with break law . 
the leader of man , bear out of you frustration . 
the leader of man , just a strange infatuation . 
the leader of man make a promise for a new life , no saviour for we sake to twist the internee of hate , self-induced manipulation to crush all thought of mass salvation .

#insight guess you dream always end . 
they do n't rise up , just descend . 
but i do n't care anymore . 
i 've lose the will to want more . 
i 'm not afraid , not at all . 
i watch they all as they fall , but i remember when we be young . 
this with habit of waste , they sense of style and good taste , of make sure you be right .

#new dawn fade a change of speed , a change of style , a change of scene with no regret , a chance to watch , admire the distance still occupy though you forget . 
different color , different shade , over each mistake be make . 
i take the blame . 
directionless , so plain to see , a load gun wo n't set you free , so you say . 
we 'll share a drink and step outside , an angry voice and one who cry , "we 'll give you everything and more . 
the straing . 
too much , ca n't take much more . 
" oh , i 've walk on water , run through fire , ca n't seem to feel it anymore . 
it be me , wait for me , hope for something more , me see me this time , hope for something else . 
#she 's lose control confusion in he eye this say it all . 
he 's lose control . 
and he 's cling to the near passer-by . 
he 's lose control . 
and he give away the secret of he past and say i 've lose control again and of a voice this tell he when and where to act . 
he say i 've lose control again . 
and he turn around and take me by the hand and say i 've lose control again . 
and how i 'll never know just why or understand . 
he say i 've lose control again . 
and he scream out , kick on he side , and say i 've lose control again . 
and seize up on the floor , i think he 'd die . 
he say i 've lose control . 
he 's lose control again . 
he 's lose control . 
he 's lose control again . 
he 's lose control . 
well , i have to phone he friend to state me case and say he 's lose control again . 
and he show up all the error and mistake and say i 've lose control again . 
but he express he in many different way until he lose control again and walk upon the edge of no escape and laugh . 
i 've lose control . 
he 's lose control again . 
he 's lose control . 
he 's lose control again . 
he 's lose control . 
i can live a little well with the myth and the lie . 
when the darkness break in , i just break down and cry . 
i can live a little in a wide line when the change be go , when the urge be go to lose control , when here we come . 
#shadowplay to the centre of the city where all road meet wait for you , to the depth of the ocean where all hope sink search for you , i be move through the silence without motion , wait for you . 
in a room with a window in the corner i find truth . 
in the shadow-play , act out you own death , know no more , as the assassin all group in four line , dance on the floor , and with cold steel , odor on they body make a move to connect , but i can only stare in disbelief as the crowd all leave . 
i do everything , everything i want to . 
i let they use you for they own end . 
to the center of the city in the night wait for you . 
to the center of the city in the night wait for you . 
#wilderness i travel far and wide throguh many different time . 
what do you see there ? 
i see the saint with they toy . 
what do you see there ? 
i see all knowledge destroy . 
i travel far and wide through many different time . 
i travel far and wide through prison of the cross . 
what do you see there ? 
the power and glory of sin . 
what do you see there ? 
the blood of christ on they skin . 
i travel far and wide through many different time . 
i travel far and wide and unknown martyr die . 
what do you see there ? 
i see the one-sided trial . 
what do you see there ? 
i see the tear as they cry . 
they have tear in they eye , tear in they eye , tear in they eye , tear in they eye . 
#interzone i walk through the city limit . 
someone talk me in to do it . 
attract by some force within it , fad to close me eye to get close to it . 
around a corner where a prophet lie , see the place where he have a room to stay , a wire fence where the child play . 
see the be where the body lie and i be look for a friend of me . 
and i have no time to waste . 
yeah , look for some friend of me . 
the car screech . 
hear the sound on dust . 
hear a noise . 
just a car outside , metallic blue turn red with rust . 
pull in close by the build 's side in a group , all forget youth . 
have to think , collect . 
me sense now be turn onto a knife-edged view . 
find some place where me friend do n't know . 
and i be look for a friend of me . 
and i have no time to waste . 
yeah , look for some friend of me . 
down the dark street the house look the same . 
get dark now . 
face look the same . 
and i walk around and around . 
no stomach . 
tear apart . 
nail me to a train . 
have to think again . 
try to find a clue . 
try to find a way to get out ! 
try to move away . 
have to move away and keep out . 
four , twelve window , ten in a row , behind a wall . 
well , i look down low . 
the light shine like a neon show . 
insert deep . 
feel a warm glow . 
no place to stop . 
no place to go . 
no time to lose . 
have to keep on go . 
i guess they die some time ago . 
i guess they die some time ago . 
and i be look for a friend of me . 
and i have no time to waste . 
yeah , look for some friend of me . 
#i remember nothing we be stranger . 
we be stranger for way too long , for way too long . 
we be stranger for way too long . 
violent , violent . 
be stranger . 
get weak all the time . 
may just pass the time . 
me in me own world and you there beside . 
the gap be enormous . 
we stare from each side . 
we be stranger for way too long . 
violent , more violent , he hand crack the chair , move on reaction , then slump in despair . 
trap in a cage and surrender too soon . 
me in me own world , the one this you know for way too long . 
we be stranger for way too long . 
we be stranger . 
we be stranger for way too long , for way too long .
