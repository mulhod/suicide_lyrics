i 'm never go to become what you become . 
do n't you dare disturb me ( do n't complicate me piece of mind ) while i 'm balance me past ( do n't complicate me piece of mind ) because you ca n't help or hurt me ( the anger , be mean be just a waste of time ) like it already have . 
it may not seem quite right , but i 'm not fuck , not quite . 
bleed white . 
bleed white . 
#waltz # 1st every time the day darken down and go away , picture open in me head of me and you , silent and cliche , all the thing we do and do n't say , cover up by what we do and do n't do , go through every out i use to cop to make the repetition stop . 
what be i suppose to say ? 
now i never leave me zone . 
we 're both alone . 
i 'm go home . 
i wish i 'd never see you face .

shake you head to say no , no , no and stop for a spell and stay this way . 
oh , well , okay . 
i get picture . 
i just do n't see it anymore . 
climb hour upon hour through a total bear with the one i keep where it never fade in the safety of a pitch-black mind , an airless cell this block the day . 
oh , well , okay . 
if you a get a feel the next time you see me , do me a favor and let me know because it 's hard to tell , it 's hard to say . 
oh , well , okay . 
oh , well , okay . 
oh , well , okay . 
#bottle up and explode ! 
bottle up and explode over and over , keep the troublemaker below . 
put it away and check out for the day and in for a round of overexposure , the thing mother nature provide to get up and go . 
bottle up and explode , see the star surround you , red , white and blue . 
you look at he like you 've never know he , but i know for a fact this you have . 
the last time you cry , who 'd you think be inside ? 
think this you be about to come over , but i 'm tire now of wait for you .

bottle up and go . 
i can make it outside . 
i 'll get though become you , become you , become you . 
# a question mark i get a question mark . 
i get a need to always take some shoot in the dark . 
i do n't have to make pretend the picture i 'm in be totally clearly . 
you think this all thing have a way they ought to appear because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know i do n't . 
i dream . 
do n't know what you mean . 
panic call you out and take you in , give you an easy game and let you win . 
you 're give back a little hatred now to the world because it treat you bad , because you can n't keep the great unknown from make you mad , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know i do n't . 
i dream . 
do n't know what you mean . 
say you final word , but honesty and love can 've keep we together . 
one day you 'll see it 's worth it after all . 
if you ever want to say you 're sorry , you can give me a call . 
#everybody care , everybody understand everybody care , everybody understand . 
yes , everybody care about you , yeah , and whether or not you want they to . 
it 's a chemical embrace this kick you in the head to a pure synthetic sympathy this infuriate you totally and a quiet lie this make you want to scream and shout . 
so here i lie dream , look at the brilliant sun rain it guide light upon everyone . 
for a moment 's rest you can lean against the banister after run upstairs again and again from wherever they come to fix you in , but always fear city 's fine follow right behind . 
you get a pretty vision in you head , a pencil full of poison lead , and a sicken smile illegal in every town . 
so here i lie dream , look at the brilliant sun rain it guide light upon everyone . 
here i lie dream , look at the brilliant sun rain it guide light upon everyone . 
you say you mean well . 
you do n't know what you mean . 
fuck ought to stay the hell away from thing you know nothing about . 
#i do n't understand think you 'd be look for the next in line to love , then ignore , put out and put away . 
and so you 'd soon be leave me alone like i 'm suppose to be tonight , tomorrow , and every day . 
there 's nothing here this you 'll miss . 
i can guarantee you this be a cloud of smoke , try to occupy space . 
what a fuck joke . 
what a fuck joke . 
i wait for a bus to separate the both of we and take me off far away from you because me feeling never change a bite . 
i always feel like shit . 
i do n't know why . 
i guess this i just do . 
you once talk to me about love and you paint picture of a never-neverland and i can 've go to this place , but i do n't understand , i do n't understand , i do n't understand .
