California (Hustle and Flow)

Running around like you're front page news, lonely eyes and your motorcycle boots.  
Tattooed heart and your jet-black hair, running round like you don't care.
Take me down, take me on down the line.
Well, I was born, babe, with nothing to lose, but the black man taught me how to sing the blues.
Made a little life outta rock and roll and that crazy California hustle and flow.
Take me down, take me on down the line.
Shake me down, shake me on down the line.
I went too fast with that rhythm and booze almost ended up dead like all those other fools.
Everyone's got some sort of ball and chain.
What's life without a little pain?
Take me down, take me on down the line.
Shake me down, shake me on down the line.
Living in a Hollywood movie dream, and I'm still reaching for the stars.
Life gets hard and then it gets good.
Like I always knew it would.
Running around like you're front page news, lonely eyes and your motorcycle boots.
Tattooed heart and your jet-black hair, running round like you don't care.
Take me down, take me on down the line.
Shake me down, shake me on down the line.
Take me down, take me on down the line.
Shake me down, shake me on down the line.


#Gimmie The Sweet and Lowdown

It was a moonlight mishap, you lost your party hat.
Seems your lifestyle be not so worthwhile after all.
A heavy-hearted taxi ride then a walk on the wild side.
Did your guardian angel let you down?
Gonna lay low and play it straight.
It's time to rejuvenate.
Gonna kick start your heart until you come around.
I can tell you now: you've really gotten the blues.
I can tell you now that I've walked in your shoes.
Gimme the sweet and lowdown.
You better get outta the way.
It's history made the hard way.
From a hero to a zero once again.
Aing. no time for vanity or this insanity.
You're maladjusted, and now you're busted once again.
I can tell you now it comes as no surprise.
I can tell you now by that look in your eyes.
Gimme the sweet and lowdown.
You're looking kinda punch drunk because that's the way you strut your stuff, with a swing and a swagger down the road you go.
You should've made a better choice and listened to your inner voice.
You got to get right or get left, don't ya know.
I can tell you now: it's the peak of bad news.
I can tell you now that I've walked in your shoes.
Gimme the sweet and lowdown, the sweet and lowdown, gimme the sweet - the sweet and lowdown.


#Diamond in the Rough

Well, I've been up, yeah, and I've been down.
Been kicked around, yeah, this god-forsaken town.
So many faults, so little time, I've got to find my piece of mind, Peace of mind.
I was looking for something, anything at all.
Something to believe in spray-painted on the walls.
I've made mistakes, yeah, I've paid for them too.
What's a poor boy supposed to do?
Then she said, yea, you're like a diamond in the rough.
You're dirty and you're damaged, all you need's a little love.
But inside there's a sparkle that'll light the stars above.
And you'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
There was a time when I could not say I got a reason to live another day.
A discarded treasure, they all passed on by and I can understand the reasons why.
Then she said, yea, you're like a diamond in the rough.
You're dirty and you're damaged, all you need's a little love.
But inside there's a sparkle that'll light the stars above.
You'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
Then she said, yeah, you're like a diamond in the rough.
You're dirty and you're damaged, all you need's a little love.
But inside there's a sparkle that'll light the stars above.
And you'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
Yea, yea, diamond in the rough.
Yea, yea, going to light the stars above.
Yea, yea, all you need's a little love.
You'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
Diamond in the rough now. 
Yea, yea who'll light the stars above now. 
Yea, yea all you need's a little love now, yea, yea, yea, yea.


#Bakersfield

Take me down that line, going to tow that heavy load.
I can't seem to make it, make it on my own.
Turn the lights down low now. 
Turn down our bed. 
I can't seem to get you out of my head.
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're so close yet so far, far away. 
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're a million miles away, yeah.
I feel the heat coming down now. 
Sweat runs down my face. 
I can hardly make it go, make it through this day. 
Was it something that I said, or something I didn't do. 
Eighteen more hours, girl, 'til I'm home to you.
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're so close yet so far, far away. 
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're a million miles away, yeah.
So I walk out that lonely truck stop with my head hanging down wondering how in the hell I got myself into this mess, and more importantly how I was going to get myself out of it.
So I wrote a song for you, baby girl. 
And I hope when I return home, the locks be not changed on the doors and there's still a spot for me on that big ol' California king size bed.
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're so close yet so far, far away. 
Stranded here in Bakersfield, you're a million miles away, yeah.
Won't you come see me in Bakersfield? 
Ooh, I'm not a million miles away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


#Writing on the Wall

There was a time when you were proud.
You looked up to me with big eyes, and I could do no wrong.
There's something inside, that's clearly tearing both of us apart, ooh ooh there's something inside.
I wonder where you are tonight, and what you did with your day.
Can't find the words to say.
Did you feel the sun?
Did you feel the warmness of my heart?
Ooh ooh did you feel at all?
They say if you love someone, you got to let them go.
And if they return to you, that's surely how you'll know.
Ooh ooh, I can read the writing on the wall, ooh ooh, but I can't let go.
They say if you love someone, you got to let them go.
And if they return to you, that's surely how you'll know.
Ooh ooh, I can read the writing on the wall, ooh ooh, but I can't let go.
I'm hopelessly aware of the good and bad traits we share.
It's like looking at myself.
And I know that at times I could've handled things differently, ooh ooh, but know my intentions were well.
They say if you love someone, you got to let them go.
And if they return to you, that's surely how you'll know.
Ooh ooh, I can read the writing on the wall, ooh ooh, but I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.
Ooh, I can't let go.


#Can't Take It with You

I'll tell you something, baby that's a fact: Never see a hearse, with a luggage rack.
All your money, your hard earned pay, it don't mean shit, baby, at the end of the end of the day.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, oh no you can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you when you go.
As sure as life, and the light of day, I'll tell you something, I've heard them they say: It don't matter, baby, what your worth, since we all, we all go back to mother earth.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, oh no you can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you when you go.
Work all your life, you become a slave.
There be not no spending when you're in the grave.
Even if it's raining, thousand dollar bills, think of me baby, in your mansion on the hill.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you (oh yeah), can't take it with you, can't take it with you, oh no you can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you when you go.
Can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you, can't take it with you...


#Still Alive

Well, I remember when we were young and you said that I was done.
Well, I walked the long boulevard my head hanging down.
And the word out on the street I was back up on my feet;
I was fighting the same old wars had to even up the scores.
And I'm still alive, and I will survive.
I can take what life's got to give just need a little time.
And I'm still alive, talking that some ol' jive.
I can handle what comes my way, just gimme another day.
And the times have changed my friend.
I'll be here to the bitter end.
With a guitar in my hand, I stand a little taller.
And I've been to hell and back,
I be not falling off this track.
From the back to the front page, from the gutter to the stage.
And I'm still alive and I will survive.
I can take what life's got to give just need a little time.
And I'm still alive, talking that some ol' jive.
I can handle what comes my way just gimme another day.
And from town to town I roam, take me so very far from home.
And I woke up one summer day and I fell in love.
And the times have changed, my friend.
I'll be here to the bitter end.
And I'm here to make my stand.
With a guitar in my hand.
And I'm still alive and I will survive.
I can take what life's got to give just need a little time.
And I'm still alive, talking that some ol' jive.
I can handle what comes my way just gimme another day, another day.

#Reach for the Sky

When I was young I was invincible.
I found myself not thinking twice.
I never thought about no future, it's just a roll of the dice.
But the day may come when you got something to lose, and just when you think you're done paying dues, you say to yourself: "Dear, God What have I Done?" and hope its not too late, cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Yesterday is history, and tomorrow is a mystery.
But baby right now, it's just about you and me.
You can run, you can hide, just like Bonnie and Clyde.
Reach for the sky be not never going to die.
And I thank the Lord for the love that I have found, and hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
So if you please take this moment, try if you can to make it last.
Don't think about no future, and just forget about the past.
And make it last.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky I be not never going down.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky I be not never coming down.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky I be not never going down.
Reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come.


#Highway 101

Take a drive baby up the coast, yea highway 101.
I'll pass Ventura and Santa Barbara too, just as fast as my motor runs.
Gotta pocket full of memories, some happy and some are sad.
Gotta girl standing by my side through the good times and the bad.
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain.
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains.
Sick boy, sick girl, looking nice dressed up on a Saturday night.
Take a walk downtown for a while and chase the pale moonlight.
I can still hear the mission bells and the train rolling through your town.
Gonna leave this world behind, we're Southern California bound.
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain.
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains.
Listen to the boulevard, listen to the falling rain.
I believe in love now, with all of its joys and pains.
Follow the palm trees under the California sun.
I believe in love now, I believe in love again.


#Don't Take Me for Granted

I'm your worn in leather jacket.
I'm the volume in your fucked up teenage band.
A bag of smokes and a six pack, I'm the dreams you had walkin down the railroad tracks, you and me.
I'm your first taste of romance.
I'm your first broken heart on a saturday night.
Guys like us be not got no chance, but I'm the thing that keeps you and me alive, but not forever.
So take me down the road.
Take me to the show.
It's something to believe in that no one else knows.
But don't take me for granted.
I'm the blood on your guitar.
I'm that wave you caught back in 1975.
I'm as strong as a thousand armies.
I'm as soft as a pedal on a long stem rose.
I am love.
So take me down the road.
Take me to the show.
It's something to believe in that no one else knows.
But don't take me for granted.
I'm with you when you're born.
You can take me when you die
With all the reasons why.
But don't take me for granted.
No one knows.
Don't take me for granted.


#Footprints on my Ceiling

Everybody wants a lover, nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past.
Long ago, without a care, pull Gardenias from her hair.
I think of a time we didn't have a care in the world.
Captivated by her beauty, I knew it was my life long duty.
She had all the grace and charm of a radiant queen.
How do you talk without speaking?
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling?
How do you take without giving?
And keep it all inside?
There are footprints on my ceiling.
I can't help this fucked up feeling.
Something's wrong, you be not coming round here no more.
Try to get my thoughts together, I think of a time when things were better this miscommunication is breaking me down.
How do you talk without speaking? 
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling?
How do you take without giving?
How you treat your new best friend?
Everybody wants a lover.
Nobody wants to uncover what may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past.
My heart is heavy, slowly sinking.
I redirect my desperate thinking, and kiss her red full lips like I did the very first time.
How do you talk without speaking? 
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling?
How do you take without giving?
There are footprints on my ceiling.
And I kept it bottled up inside all my life.


#Nickels and Dimes

I'm a Cadillac tramp at the end of his road.
A swap meet rat who's sitting on gold, yeah baby.
I'm a guitar gangster without a tune.
I'm the baseball bat that's waiting to swing.
Your loan shark friend with the broken knees, yeah baby.
I'm a penthouse pauper with nothing to lose.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm chasing Nickles and Dimes.
The rest of the world passes me by.
Nah, Nah, Nah, Im just wasting my time.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
I'm the high rolling creep that's in too deep with the slicked back hair and the silver teeth, yeah baby.
I'm a vagabond king with a stolen crown.
I'm a jailhouse poet, a genius, a fool, I'm the pimp who lost his cool, yeah baby.
I've got first class taste in a second class town.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm chasing Nickles and Dimes.
The rest of the world passes me by.
Nah, Nah, Nah, Im just wasting my time.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
Yeah.
I'm a loaded gun that pointed at the mirror.
A drugstore cowboy whose end is near, yeah baby.
I'm a big time schemer with broken down dreams.
I'm a derelict rebel without a cause.
I be not the cat with the sharpest claws, no baby.
Cause sometimes life just be not what it seems.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm chasing Nickles and Dimes.
The rest of the world passes me by.
Nah, Nah, Nah, Im just wasting my time.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
And just like you, I'm wondering why.


#I Wasn't Born to Follow

When I grow up, going to be a star.
Gonna sing my songs and play my guitar, I'm ready.
Gonna change the world, going to turn the page, going to say what I feel, let out this rage, get ready.
We're going down, down to the streets below.
Gonna sing the songs of the streets again.
Gonna knock me off my feet, so get ready.
I'll sing a song for the fallen angels.
This one goes to all the unsung heroes.
We're going down, down to the streets below, cause don't you know, I wasn't born to follow.
I realize that in your eyes you got ideas but I got mine, get ready.
Here comes the new generation. 
Hope they feel and fight the same way as we did.
We're going down, down to the streets below, cause I wasn't born, I wasn't born to follow, no.
When I grow up, going to be a star.
Gonna sing my songs and play my guitar, I'm ready.

We're going down, down, down, down.
We're going down, down, down, down.
I said goodbye to the masses. 
I wasn't born to follow.


#Winners and Losers

Winners and losers, turn the pages of my life. 
We're beggars and choosers, with all the struggles and the strife. 
I got no reason to turn my head and look the other way. 
We're good and we're evil. 
which one will I be today?
There's saints and sinners. 
Life's a gamble and you might lose. 
There's cowards and heroes, both have been known now to break the rules. 
There's lovers and haters. 
The strong and the weak will all have their day. 
We're devils and angels. 
Which one will I be today?
Are you happy now with all the choices you've made? 
Are there times in life when you know you should have stayed? 
Will you compromise then realize the price is too much to pay? 
Winners and losers, which one will you be today? 
There's a light and a dark side. 
Standing at the crossroads, there we'll meet. 
There's prophets and fools there. 
The lies and the truth, will be at our feet. 
I got a reason to turn my head and look the other way. 
It's heaven and hell here. 
Which one will I live today?
Are you happy now with all the choices you've made? 
Are there times in life when you know you should have stayed? 
Did you compromise then realize the price was too much to pay? 
Winners and losers, which one will you be today?
Which one will you be today? 
Which one will I be today?


#Faithless

I know a girl who warns of the dangers of love, all the pain and the anguish, the sorrow that it brings.
She keeps herself in a world that's protected.
Her outsides are tough, but inside her heart longs to sing.
Don't let your walls down, you might fall in love, you might fall in love.
He's going to get his girlfriend's name tattooed on his neck and hope he never, never lives to regret.
He's going to walk down that long, dark alley and what he finds there you know he'll never forget.
Don't let your walls down, you might fall in love, you might fall in love.
They're crashing down now.
You might fall in love.
I remember a time I believed that the words love and pain were both one in the same.
I'm going to trade in my old ways for a new shot at life.
I'm going to change, change my direction.
I'm going to change my ways.
Don't let your walls down, you might fall in love, you might fall in love.
They're crashing down now.
It's you I'm thinking of, it's you I'm thinking of.
Let's fall in love.


#Live Before You Die

When pressures up, and the stress is high, and I want to bid this world good bye, I'm going to bury my frustrations, grab some of life's satisfactions, yeah, I'm going to live before I die.
I try to find some peace of mind when my life's treating me unkind.
Pain will be my motivation.
I'm going to use my imagination.
yeah, I'm going to live before I die.
So close your eyes, and embrace your memories.
leave your troubles and your worries far behind.
stop contemplating and start celebrating.
yeah, you got to live before you die.
I think of chances I didn't take.
i try to learn from my mistakes, yeah.
I'm tired of being pushed around now.

#Angel's Wings

You say you're down on your luck. 
Hey baby, it's a long, long way up. 
Hold back now, hold back your fears.
You say you're really down and out, and you feel like there's no way out now. 
Let go now, let go of your tears some more.
How many times have you asked yourself: Is this the hand of fate now that I've been dealt? 
You're so disillusioned, this can't be real, and you can't stand now the way you feel.
I don't care about what they say.
I won't live or die that way. 
Tired of figuring out things on my own. 
Angel's wings, won't you carry me home.
And when you're down on your luck, hey baby, it's a long, long way up. 
Hold back now, hold back your fears.
And when you're really down and out, and you feel like there's no way out now. 
Let go now, let go of your tears some more.
And when you're down on your luck, hey baby, it's a long, long way up.
Hold back now, hold back your fears.
And when you're really down and out, and you feel like there's no way out now.
Let go now, let go of your tears some more.
I triumphed in the face of adversity, and I became the man I never thought I'd be. 
And now my biggest challenge, a thing called love. 
I guess I'm not as tough as I thought I was.
I don't care about what they say, I'm going to marry you some day. 
Go ahead and wake up, it's a brand new day. 
Angel's wings going to carry you away. 
Angel's wings going to carry me away. 
Angel's wings going to carry us away, going to carry us away, Gonna carry us away, Gonna carry us away.

#So Far Away

I've sung the blues, for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you.
I've paid my dues, working hard-sweat, blood, and tears for you.
So far away, So far away, So far away!
So far away, So far away, So far away! 
I've had it all, and lost it all in one blackout summer night.
I want it back, but I just can't seem to get it right.
So far away, So far away, So far away!
So far away, So far away, So far away! 
I've sung the blues, for every broken hearted lovesick dream for you.
I've paid my dues, working hard-sweat, blood and tears for you.
So far away, So far away, So far away! 
So far away, So far away, So far away! 


#Let it be Me

I've been in love, but now I'm waiting.
Don't ever want to worry about a thing.
I sit at home and I wonder: will I rise or will I go under.
Let it be me, let it be me, if you're lonely.
Let it be me, let it be me, your one and only.
Let it be me, let it be me, to satify you.
Let it be me, if your feeling blue.
I've seen you aroud, but you don't know me.
I've watched your life, but can't always see.
I'll try and I'll try girl to love you.
And when we die,  you will have loved too.
Let it be me, let it be me, if you're lonely.
Let it be me, let it be me, your one and only.
Let it be me, let it be me, to satify you.
Let it be me, if your feeling blue.
You know your friends talk bad about me.
Your folks say it's not suppose to be.
You know girl your life is going by fast, try to make it last.
Let it be me, let it be me, if you're lonely.
Let it be me, let it be me, your one and only.
Let it be me, let it be me, to satify you.
Let it be me, if your feeling blue.


#Story of my Life

High school seemed like such a blur.
I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections, and in class, I dreamed all day, of a rock 'n' roll weekend.
And the girl in the front of the room, so close yet so far you know she never seemed to notice that this silly schoolboy crush wasn't just pretend.
Life goes by so fast.
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past.
Story of my life.
And I went down my old neighborhood.
The faces have all changed; there's no one left to talk to, and the pool hall I loved as a kid is now a Seven Eleven.
I went downtown to look for a job.
I had no training, no experience to speak of.
And I looked at the holes in my jeans, and turned and headed back.
Life goes by so fast.
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past.
Story of my life.
Good times come, and good times go.
I only wish the good times would last a little longer.
And I think about the good times we had and why they had to end.
So I sit at the edge of my bed.
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song.
Thinking 'bout what you're doing now, and when you're coming back.
Life goes by so fast.
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past.
Story of my life.

#Ball and Chain

Well it's been ten years and a thousand tears, and look at the mess I'm in.
A broken nose and a broken heart, an empty bottle of gin.
Well I sit and I pray in my broken down Chevrolet.
While I'm singing to myself, there's got to be another way.
Take away, take away, take away this ball and chain.
Well I'm lonely and I'm tired, and I can't take any more pain.
Take away, take away, never to return again.
Take away, take away, take away, Take away this ball and chain.
Well I've searched and I've searched to find the perfect life.
A brand new car and a brand new suit, I even got me a little wife.
But wherever I have gone I was sure to find myself there.
You can run all your life, but not go anywhere.
Take away, take away, take away this ball and chain.
Well I'm lonely and I'm tired, And I can't take any more pain.
Take away, take away, never to return again.
Take away, take away, take away, take away this ball and chain.  
Well I'll pass the bar on the way to my dingy hotel room.
I spent all my money, I've been drinking since half past noon.
Well I'll wake there in the morning, or maybe in the county jail.
Times are hard, getting harder, 
I'm born to lose and destined to fail.
Take away, take away, take away this ball and chain.
Well I'm lonely and I'm tired, and I can't take any more pain.
Take away, take away, never to return again.
Take away, take away, take away, take away this ball and chain.


#It Could 've Been Me

I got friends who are in prison, friends who are dead.
I'm going to tell ya something that I've often said.
You know these things that happen, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't ya know it could 've been me.
I had me a good girl, her kisses sweeter than wine.
And I had always hoped that someday I'd make her mine.
But she ran off and married, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't ya know it could 've been me.
Well the junkie cops on First Street, sticks a needle in his arm.
No, he never meant to do anyone no harm.
But he's buried six feet deep, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't ya know it could 've been me.
I had me a good girl, her kisses sweeter than wine.
And I had always hoped that someday I'd make her mine.
Bus she ran off and married, that's just the way it's supposed to be.
And I can't help but wonder, don't you know it could 've been me.
Could 've been me, could 've been me, could been me, could 've been me, could 've been me,
could 've been me, could 've been me, could 've been me.
Could 've been, should 've been me.


#She's a Knockout

Everywhere she goes, people turn their heads, she's a knockout.
Everyone wishes she was sleeping in their beds, she's a knockout.
When guys see her coming they start spending their money, she's a knockout.
But don't you know I'm the only one who can call her honey, she's a knockout.
She's a knockout, She's a knockout, she's a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, she's a knockout.
She's exotic but not foreign, built like an old Cadillac, she's a knockout.
Once she's left your life she be not never coming back, she's a knockout.
With her black silk stockings and her high-heeled shoes, she's a knockout.
Once she's left your life, you'll surely sing the blues, she's a knockout.
he's a knockout, She's a knockout, she's a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, she's a knockout.
Some friends were telling me, just the other day,
They walk right up to her, they don't know what to say.
And when she calls me, hear a ring on the telephone,
I'll be there waiting for her, sitting at home all alone, all alone.
In the nightclubs baby when the lights shine down, she's a knockout.
If the feeling be not right she don't even come around, she's a knockout.
When she walks down the aisle ya know her hips begin to sway, she's a knockout.
come on little baby I'll show you the way, she's a knockout.
She's a knockout, She's a knockout, she's a knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, she's a knockout.


#A Place in my Heart

I saw her today, oh God I miss her smile.
A pleasant memory of things in life worthwhile, the things worthwhile.
We used to walk, and we used to talk.
We used to laugh, and we used to cry.
And there will always be a place in my heart for her.
I thought of her today, of years together spent.
A pleasant memory of places that we went, the places we went.
We used to walk, and we used to talk.
We used to laugh, and we used to cry.
And there will always be a place in my heart for her.


#Drug Train

It'll take you as high as the heavens.
It'll take you to the depths of hell.
It'll make you friends, it'll take your friends who will never live to tell.
Drug train, drug train.
Drug train, drug train.
The traing. first stop is pleasure.
The scond stop is fun.
But in a jail cell, baby, in a hospital bed, you'll need hope, because you
be not got none.
Drug train, drug train.
Drug train, drug train.
The train passes through the graveyard.
May the loved ones rest in peace.
For the last stop baby is a violent crash and hard times they never cease.
Drug train, drug train.
Drug train, drug train.

#Cold Feelings

Uninvited feelings, they come without warning and they stay too long.
I don't want to feel, and if I run they'll be just as strong.
I've been a-waiting, I'm waiting for some kind of sign.
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.
I watch the clock as the second hand slowly goes strolling by.
I don't want to feel, when a loved one's time's come to die.
I've been a-waiting, I'm waiting for some kind of a sign.
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.
Cold feelings in the night.
You know, this feeling just be not right.
And though I try I just can't hide.
Cold feelings in the night.
Look out!
Yeah I got faith, but sometimes fear it just weighs too much.
I don't want to feel, cold winds blowing through me like an empty touch.
I've been a-waiting, I'm waiting for some kind of sign.
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.
Cold feelings in the night.
You know, this feeling just be not right.
And though I try I just can't hide.
Cold feelings in the night.
Cold feelings in the night.
Cold feelings in the night.
Cold feelings in the night.


#Bad Luck

Some people like to gamble, but you, you always lose.
Some people like to rock 'n' roll; you're always singing the blues.
You got to nasty disposition, no one really knows the reason why.
You got to bad, bad reputation.
Gonna hang your head down and cry.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
Thirteen's my lucky number, to you it means stay inside.
Black cat done crossed my path, no reason to run and hide.
You're looking through a cracked mirror, no one really knows the reason why.
Your enemies are getting nearer.
Gonna hang down your head and cry.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
Some people go to church on Sundays, others they pray at home.
You tell them that there be not no God, that they're better off standing alone.
You're always scratching at the eight ball, no one really knows the reason why.
You get to the top and then you fall.
Gonna hang down your head and cry.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
Don't give it to me.
You got bad, bad luck.

#Born to Lose 

I was brought in this world 1962, I didn't have much choice you see.
But by the time I was eight, I could tell it was too late, I was already barking up the wrong tree.
When I was in school, you thought I was a fool, in trouble, breaking all the rules.
I was absent from class, my daddy spanked my bare ass, but I sure tried hard to be cool.
Born to lose, was what they said, you know I was better off dead.
Born to lose, you're just bad news, you don't get a second chance.
It was a hot summer night in mid July, a hangover and a black eye.
Your momma said I was a loser, a dead end cruiser, and deep inside I know that she was right.
Born to lose, was what they said, you know I was better off dead.
Born to lose, you're just bad news, you don't get a second chance.
I tried to get myself a job because that's the way that things are, want to have nice things and go far. 
Well I'm sorry honey, I be not got much money, but I can sure play this here old
Guitar. 
As the years went on, I made a few mistakes it was a troublebound for this young Man.
The police knocking at my door, "Well he don't live here no more, and he's playing in a rock 'n' roll band."
Born to lose, was what they said, you know I was better off dead.
Born to lose, you're just bad news, you don't get a second chance.


#When She Begins

I was feeling kinda beat, I decided to hit the streets. 
I was looking for a place for this heart of mine. 
Well I said to myself, oh God this must be hell.
I think I was slowly losing my mind.
Well round and round she goes where she'll stop nobody knows.
Y'know that woman put a spell on me. 
But if you start me, start me, start me, you can't stop me, stop me, stop me. 
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll.
I was hanging by the phone, tired of sleeping alone.
Baby tell me where did I go wrong? 
When minutes seem like hours and days seem like weeks, how could a year last so fucking long?
Well round and round she goes where she'll stop nobody knows.
Y'know that woman put a spell on me. 
But if you start me, start me, start me, you can't stop me, stop me, stop me. 
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll.
I was hanging with a couple of chicks, man I was just looking for kicks.
I was looking for a place for this raggedy ol' heart of mine.
Well I said to myself, oh God this must be hell.
I think I was slowly losing my mind.
Well round and round she goes where she'll stop nobody knows.
Y'know that woman put a spell on me. 
But if you start me, start me, start me, you can't stop me, stop me, stop me. 
When she begins to rock, honey, I begin to roll.


#99 to Life

I'm broken hearted, I'm a broken man. 
Driven by anger, on that night I ran. 
I had me a woman.
I thought that she'd be true.
Now she's gone and left me, you know her life is through.
Lonely weekends, baby lonely nights. 
The judge he gave me, ninety nine to life.
I wish she could be here, Lord if She only could. 
Instead she's laying in a puddle of blood.
She was my baby, thought she'd be my wife. 
I killed my baby, I killed her with my knife.
Lonely weekends, baby lonely nights. 
The judge he gave me, ninety nine to life.
So alone I'm sitting in my prison cell Lord only knows now, I'm in a living hell.
The rest of my life, in this penitentiary, the good Lord above now, please have mercy on me.
Lonely weekends, baby lonely nights. 
The judge he gave me, ninety nine to life.


#King of Fools

I was born a King of Fools.
Most people think I'm just a playboy breaking rules.
But they don't know that when it comes around to love, I always lose.
That's why I call myself the King of Fools.
I was born never to care, but now I want to love that I can share.
I've searched in vain for a love that would never be true.
That's why I call myself the King of Fools.
King of Fools, King of Fools, when it comes around your love, I always lose.
I was born without one good thought.
Just to live fast, tell a lie and break a heart.
I have broken many hearts and I've broken many rules.
That's why I call myself the King of Fools.
I was born the King of Fools.
At any other game I never lose.
But when it comes around to love, that's when I realize: I was born the King of Fools.
King of Fools, King of Fools, at any other game I never lose.
King of Fools, King of Fools, when it comes around your love, I always lose.


#Sometimes I Do

Sometimes I like you and sometimes I don't, I feel like I'm going to and then I won't.
Sometimes I want to live to see a hundred, other times I want to lay down and die.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I'm weak and sometimes I'm strong.
You know that I've loved all along.
Sometimes I'm rich and sometimes I'm poor.
nothing really matters when you're dead on the floor.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I'm hot, and sometimes I'm cold.
Other times I feel like I'm getting old.

Other times I don't even want to go.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I laugh, and sometimes I cry.
Other times I sit and wonder why.
Sometimes I'm up, and sometimes I'm down.
Other times I want to blow this town.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.

#Dear Lover

Yeah, loving over and over again now.
It be not nothing girl till you've felt the pain.
Up against the wall.
Why does love always have to hurt?
Your scratches run across my back and then a tear.
Dear lover, I can't take the pain no more.
Dear lover, I pick my heart up from the floor.
Dear lover, I can't believe it's come to this.
Dear lover, give me one last painful kiss.
There be not nothing in this world for free now.
So how high of a price will you pay?
Hear the screams so loud, wake up to the broken glass.
It's a scene from bad to worse and many more tears.
Dear lover, I can't take the pain no more.
Dear lover, I pick my heart up from the floor.
Dear lover, I can't believe it's come to this.

#Don't Drag Me Down

Children are taught to hate. 
Parents just couldn't wait. 
Some are rich and some are poor. 
Others will just suffer more.
Have you ever been ashamed and felt society try to keep you down? 
I begin to watch things change And see them turn around.
Turn around, they'll try to keep you down. 
Turn around, turn around, don't drag me down.
Ignorance like a gun in hand. 
Reach out to the promised land.
Your history books are full of lies.
Media-blitz going to dry your eyes.
Have you ever been afraid and felt society try to keep you down? 
I begin to watch things change and see them turn around.
Turn around, they'll try to keep you down. 
Turn around, turn around, don't drag me down.
Ignorance like a gun in hand. 
Reach out to the promised land.
Your history books are full of lies. 
Media-blitz going to dry your eyes.
You're eighteen, want to be a man. 
Your granddaddy's in the Ku Klux Klan, taking two steps forward and four steps back. 
Gonna go to the White House and paint it black.
Turn around, They'll try to keep you down. 
Turn around, turn around, they'll try to keep you down,
Turn around, don't drag me down.


#I was Wrong

Oh, when I was young I was so full of fear.
I hid behind anger, held back the tears.
It was me against the world.
I was sure that I'd win, but the world fought back, punished me for my sins.
I felt so alone, so insecure.
I blamed you instead, made sure I was heard, and they tried to warn me of my evil ways but I wouldn't hear what they had to say.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
I realize now that I was wrong.
And I think about my loves, well, I've had a few.
Well, I'm sorry that I hurt them.
Did I hurt you too?
I took what I wanted, put my heart on the shelf, but how can you love me when you don't love yourself?
It was me against the world.
I was sure that I'd win.
The world fought back, punished me for my sins and they tried to warn me of my evil ways, but I couldn't hear what they had to say.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
I realize now that I was wrong.
I was wrong, yeah, I was wrong.
I grew up fast, and I grew up hard.
Something was wrong from the very start.
I was fighting everybody, I was fighting everything, But the only one that I hurt was me.
I got society's blood running down my face.
Somebody help me get outta this place.
How could someone's bad luck last so long?
Until I realized that I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
I realize now that I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Self destruction's got me again.
I was wrong.
The only moment that I was me, I was wrong.


#Through These Eyes

Through these eyes I've seen love and I've seen hate.
I've seen the violence and the tears through these eyes.
I got my schooling on the streets.
I've seen the things in life you don't want to see.
Through these eyes, I've seen the shape of things to come, and I've watched them all fall apart, through these eyes.
I've seen the broken homes, they cry.
I've seen the poor man's face as he stands in line.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on.
Through these eyes, I've looked the devil in the face and I've seen God's holy grace, through these eyes.
I've tried to walk the straighter line.
I found myself again but nearly lost my mind.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on, yeah.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on.
And though my heart has made me weary on a road less travelled on.
Through the heart it hurts so dearly and the pain it lingers on.


#Down on the World Again

There's a world of guilt written on my face, and I feel ashamed for the human race.
I've been forsaken, and I'm down on the world again.
Well, I feel so alone in this crowd. 
My thoughts of despair are getting loud.
I'm disrespected and I'm down on the world again.
Love and tolerance have abandoned me, and I feel the gloom hovering over me.
I'm resentful, and I'm down on the world again.
Give me tomorrow's broken dreams now.
I'm feeling like a loaded gun.
Give me tomorrow's holy schemes now, so hopeless when there's no place left to run.
Well, I tried to play for the higher stakes.
You won't let me forget my mistakes.
I'm unforgiven, and I'm down on the world again.
This be not the way it's supposed to be. 
There's a dark cloud following me.
I'm distorted, and I'm down on the world again.

#Crown of Thorns

Pretty much been alone now for almost five years.
I could always find a way to hide these bitter tearsa
And still I'm a-waiting a-wishing somehow; I wish I knew then what I know now.
It's no bed of roses, It be not no crown of thorns.
Better than lonely.

#Pleasure Seeker

Well, here I come.
I'm on a run.
Who wants to fight temptation, that's no fun.
C'mon and play the games.
Don't you feel no shame.
That's what Eve said to Adam before she came.
You can smile now, cry later on.
You know that it might be wrong, but it feels so good, lIke you knew it would.
There's damnation and disgrace.
And guilt rears its ugly face, yet you beg for more, just a little more.
Stand in line.
Don't you lose your mind.
Try like me to seek your pleasure, three at a time.
There's souls for sale.
You're going to burn in Hell.
And if tomorrow never comes, it's just as well.

#Down Here (with the Rest of Us)

You work hard now, to put the food on the table.
You're working for the men who don't even know your name.
That's the way that it goes when you're down here with the rest of us.
You might lose now, your beautiful children, your happy home, yeah, and your beautiful wife.

#When Angels Sing

At last we meet again, dear God, hear the angels sing. 
The funerals are nicer when we know you're there, when the angels sing. 
Sometimes I try so hard to understand the things you do.
I like to question you when it all comes down, hear the angels sing.
Stand up strong, feel the pain, when the angels sing.
Love and death don't mean a thing till the angels sing.
The prisoners pray when they're on to death row, when the angels sing.
The junky cries for love but it's all run out, when the angels sing.
The sins of the world.
And it's cold on the streets and you're all alone and the tears they start to fall when it all comes down, hear the angels sing.
Stand up strong, feel the pain, when the angels sing.
Love and death don't mean a thing, till the angels sing.
Little by little, day by day, I watch the children play.
Cause life and death don't mean a thing, till the angels sing.
When the angel of death comes to looking for me, hear the angels sing.
I hope I was everything I was supposed to be, when the angels sing.
There's got to be a heaven cause I've already done my time in hell.
And a little, baby's born, when it all comes down, hear the angels sing.
Stand up strong, feel the pain, when the angels sing.
Love and death don't mean a thing, till the angels sing.
Little by little, day by day, I watch the children play because life and death don't mean a thing till the angels sing.
