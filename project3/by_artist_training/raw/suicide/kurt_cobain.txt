Blew

If you wouldn't mind, I would like to blew.
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose.
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave.
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breathe.
Is there another reason for your stain?
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame.

#Floyd the Barber

Bell on door clanks.
come on in.
Floyd observes my hairy chin.
Sit down in the chair.
don't be afraid.
Steamed hot towel on my face.
I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed.
I'm ashamed.
Barney ties me to the chair.
I can't see.
I'm really scared.
Floyd breathes hard.
I hear a zip.
Pee-pee pressed against my lips.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
I sense others in the room.
Opie Aunt Bee, I presume.
They take turns and cut me up.
I die smothered in Andy's clutch.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.
I was shamed.


#About a Girl

I need an easy friend.
I do, with an ear to lend.
I don't think you fit this shoe.
I do.
won't you have a clue?
I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry, but I can't see you every night.
Free.
I do.
I'm standing in your line.
I do hope you have the time.
I do pick a number too.
I do keep a date with you.
I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry, but I can't see you every night.
Free.

#Love Buzz

Would you believe me when I tell you you are the queen of my heart?
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you.
Just be not the way it seems.
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?

#Paper Cuts

When I'm feeling tired, she pushed food through the door and I crawl towards the crack of light.
Sometimes I can't find my way.
Newspapers spread around, soaking all that they can.
A cleaning is due again, a good hosing down.
The lady whom I feel maternal love for cannot look me in the eyes, but I see hers and they are blue and they cock and twitch and masturbate!
I said so.
I said so.
I said so.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Black windows of paint I scratched with my nails.
I see others just like me.
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones.
They point in my way.
They come with a flash of light and take my family away.
And very later I have learned  to accept some friends of ridicule.
My whole existence is for your amusement and that is why I'm here with you, to take me with.
You're right.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.

#Swap Meet

They lead a lifetime that is comfortable.
They travel far to keep their stomachs full.
They make their living off of arts and crafts, the kind with seashells, driftwood, and burlap.
They make a deal when they come to town.
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground.
She loves him more than he will ever know.
He loves her more than he will ever show.
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart.
Keeps her photographs close to her heart.
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart.

Portray sincerity.
Act out of loyalty.
Defend every country.
Wish away the pain.
Hand out lobotomies to save little families.
Surrealistic fantasy.
Bland, boring pain!
Hold me down in restitution, living out your date with fusion.
Is the whole fleece shun in, master?
Don't feel guilty, master, writing.
Somebody said that they're not much like I am.
I know I can make enough of the words.
as you go along, I sing then some.
Sickening pessimist hypocrite master.
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard.
Thank you, dear God, for putting me on this Earth.
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!

#Serve The Servants

Teenage angst has paid off well.
Now I'm bored and old.
Self-appointed judges judge more than they have sold.
If she floats, then she is not a witch like we had thought.
A down payment on another one at salem's lot.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
Serve the servants, oh, no.
That legendary divorce is such a bore.
As my bones grew they did hurt.
They hurt really bad.
I tried hard to have a father, but instead I had a dad.
I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore.
There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before.
Serve the servants, oh, no.

#Scentless Apprentice

Like most babies smell like butter, his smell smelled like no other.
He was born scentless and senseless.
He was born a scentless apprentice.
Go away.
get away.
get away.
Every wet nurse refused to feed him.
Electrolytes smell like semen.
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets.
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers.
Go away.
get away.
get away.
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms.
Leaking-out gas fumes are made into perfume.
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit.
Go away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
get away.
get away.


#Heart-Shaped Box

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak.
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks.
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap.
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.
Hey! Wait!

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet.
Cut myself on angel's hair and baby's breath.
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black.
Throw down your umbilical noose, so I can climb right back.
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint, forever in debt to your priceless advice.

#Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid.
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking wherever you get your way.
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me.
this is starting to sound the same.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
In her false witness, we hope you're still with us to see if they float or drown.
Our favorite patient, a display of patience, disease-covered Puget Sound.
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars and leave a blanket of ash on the ground.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.
I miss the comfort in being sad.

#Dumb

I'm not like them, but I can pretend.
The sun is gone, but I have a light.
The day is done, but I'm having fun.
I think I'm dumb or maybe just happy, think I'm just happy, think I'm just happy, think I'm just happy.
My heart is broke, but I have some glue.
Help me inhale and mend it with you.
We'll float around and hang out on clouds.
Then we'll come down and have a hangover, have a hangover, have a hangover, have a hangover.
Skin the sun.
Fall asleep.
Wish away.
The soul is cheap.
Lesson learned.
Wish me luck.
Soothe the burn.
Wake me up.
I'm not like them, but I can pretend.
The sun is gone, but I have a light.

I'm on my time with everyone.
I have very bad posture.
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea.
Distill the life that's inside of me.
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea.
I'm anemic royalty.
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld, so I can sigh eternally.
I'm so tired.
I can't sleep.
I'm a liar and a thief.
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea.
I'm anemic royalty.
I'm on warm milk and laxatives, cherry-flavored antacids.

#Radio Friendly Unit Shifter

I just want to know, do you like me?
Use just once and destroy.
Invasion of our piracy.
Afterbirth of a nation.
Starve without your skeleton key.

#Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip

It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing that you're only supposed to use once and then discard.
Where do you put it?
In the garbage can, my honest friend.
My shyness, pet her flow.
She's only been five months late even though we haven't had sex for a week.
A meal a day, a meal, I say, and my heart's made my.
Somebody else already used the word aurora borealis.
She was tied up in chains and Sam had helped her in the freezer.
She's only five weeks late, but I haven't had a date forever, ever, ever, forever!
Wish I had more, more opportunity, more chances to remember some things, so I couldn't have so much pressure on my, on my, on my, um, ah, on my, um, um, head.
We'd have so much more diversity and so much more input, so much more creative flow if we had someone in school, a GIT.
GIT, geeks in town.
Ha!
Come on, Dave, think of one!
Girls with trouble.
It should be GIC.
geeks with charvels.
No, GWC.
fuck, man, this is a waste of time.
One more solo?
Yeah!
Yeah!
You're personally responsible for the entire strip to be washed away, cleansed, as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol flowed through the strip and were set on fire.
It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight.
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom and his silk and he, he erected a beautiful city, a city of stars.

Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be, as a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy.
Take your time.
hurry up.
The choice is yours.
don't be late.
Take a rest as a friend, as an old memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria.
Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be, as a trend, as a friend, as an old memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria.
And I swear that I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
No, I don't have a gun.
memoria, memoria, memoria.
Memoria, and I don't have a gun
And I swear that I don't have a gun.

#Lithium

I'm so happy because today I've found my friends.
They're in my head.
I'm so ugly, but that's okay because so are you.
We've broken our mirrors.
Sunday morning is every day for all I care and I'm not scared.
Light my candles in a daze because I've found god.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm so lonely, but that's okay.
I shaved my head.
And I'm not sad and just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard.
But I'm not sure.
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to meet you there.
But I don't care.
I'm so horny, but that's okay.
My will is good.

#Polly

Polly wants a cracker.
I think I should get off her first.
I think she wants some water to put out the blow-torch.
It isn't me.
We have some seed.
Let me clip your dirty wings.
Let me take a ride.
Don't cut yourself.
I want some help to please myself.
I've got some rope.
You have been told.
I promise you I have been true.
Let me take a ride.
Don't cut yourself.
I want some help to please myself.
Polly wants a cracker.
Maybe she would like some food.
She asks me to untie her.
A chase would be nice for a few.

Polly said, Polly says her back hurts and she's just as bored as me.
She caught me off my guard.
It amazes me, the will of instinct.
It isn't me.
We have some seed.
Let me clip your dirty wings.

#Territorial Pissings

Come on, people.
now, smile on your brother and everybody get together.
try to love one another right now.
When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions.
Got to find a way, to find a way when I'm here.
Got to find a way, a better way.
I had better wait.
Never met a wise man.
if so it's a woman.
Got to find a way, to find a way when I'm here.
Got to find a way, a better way.
I had better wait.
Got to find a way, to find a way when I'm here.

#Drain You

One baby to another says, I'm lucky to have met you.
I don't care what you think unless it is about me.
It is now my duty to completely drain you, a travel through a tube, and end up in your infection.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours.
I like you.
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil.
You've taught me everything without a poison apple.
The water is so yellow.
I'm a healthy student, indebted and so grateful.
Vacuum out the fluids.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours.
I like you, you, you, you, you, you.

Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours, sloppy lips to lips.
You're my vitamins.
I'm like you.


#Lounge Act

Truth covered in security.
I can't let you smother me.
I'd like to, but it couldn't work.
Trading off and taking turns, I don't regret a thing and I've got this friend, you see,
 who makes me feel and I wanted more than I could steal.
I'll arrest myself.
I'll wear a shield.
I'll go out of my way to prove I still, I still smell her on you.
Don't tell me what I want to hear.
Afraid of never knowing fear.
Experience anything you need.
I'll keep fighting jealousy until it's fucking gone.
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel and I wanted more than I could steal.
I'll arrest myself.

We've made a pact to learn from whoever we want without new rules.
We'll share what's lost and what we grew.
They'll go out of their way to prove they still, still smell her on you, still smell her on you, still smell her on you.


#Stay Away

Monkey see.

I don't know why I'd rather be dead than cool.
I don't know why every line ends in rhyme.
I don't know why less is more, love is blind.
I don't know why.
Stay, stay away, stay away, stay away.
Give an inch.
take a smile.
I don't know why fashion shits fashion-style.
I don't know why.
throw it out and keep it in.
I don't know why.

#On A Plain

I'll start this off without any words.
I got so high that I scratched till I bled.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I ever had was when I learned to cry on command.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
My mother died every night, it's safe to say.
don't quote me on that.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again, forgot to put on the zip code.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.
I'm on a plain.
Somewhere I have heard this before, in a dream of memory restored.
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed.
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear, to write off lines that don't make sense.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
And one more special message to go and then I'm done.
then I can go home.
I love myself better than you.
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
I'm on a plain.
I can't complain.

Take a step outside yourself and you turn around.
Take a look at who you are.
It's pretty scary, so silly.
It's Revolting.
You're not much.
You can't do anything.
Take a step outside the city and you turn around.
Take a look at what you are.
It is revolting.
You're really nowhere, so wasteful, so foolish, poppycock!
Who said don't look back?
Don't believe them.
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant because they're going to try and get behind you.
Don't you let them do it.
You know what I'm talking about?

Turn around and around.
Take a look at where you are.
It's pretty scary.

#Beeswax

Why doesn't she need him for a father?
Not only maidens can occupy my shack.
Goring my manhood turns a man off.
Like Pepe LePew would say, Hey, hey, hey! and then we clash!
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly.
She laughs about it, shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right, jacking themselves off polyester.
I want to jump.
this isn't right! 
Hey, when am I getting it back?
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.

I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly spayed.
I got my diddly.
If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly.
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy.
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate.
Feeling can't help me romp.
Bill, just fuck me.
take me anal.
Billy's slit reminds me of someone.
I'm sick of paying for the love boat.
Tony and Tenille say, want to jump rope?
And I say look!
I got my penis spayed. 
I got a little tail.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got my dingaling spayed.
I got to be around pussy.
Don't let me fall.
I got a heh-heh.

#Mexican Seafood

All the itchy flakes it is aflaming, all the gels and creams it is pertaining to, a fungus mold cured by injection.
Hope it's only a yeast infection.
Oh, well, it burns when I, it hurts when I pee.
Oh, well, it hurts when I, it hurts when I see.
Now I vomit cum and diarrhoea on the tile floor like oatmeal pizza, fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy puss.
I feel the blood becoming chowder rust.
Oh, well, it burns when I, it hurts when I pee.
Oh, well, it hurts when I, it hurts when I see.
Roll into my bed, which does consist of lice, bugs and fleas and yellow mucus, stained dirt, vaseline, toe-jam and booger, stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge.

Wish the hardest, at night.
Wishful goddess, at night.
Wishful gah!
I was your mind.
you were my, my enemy.
You were mine.

You would

I was your, your enemy.

At night, the wishful goddess.
At night, she'll wish the hardest.
At night, the disco goddess.
At night, the itch so modest.
At night, the crisco lochness.
At night, a mouthful omelette.
At sight, the fish full goblets.
At night, the witch go god!


#Aero Zeppelin

What's a season in a right if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything?
What's the meaning in a crime?
it's a fan if anything.
Where's the learning in a line?
it's a brand.
it's a brand.
How a culture comes again.
it was all here yesterday and you swear it's not a trend.
doesn't matter anyway.
There's only here to talk to friends.
nothing new is every day.
You could shit upon the stage.
they'll be fans.
They'll be fans.
They'll be fans.
They'll be fans.
All the kids will eat it up if it's packaged properly.
Steal a sound and imitate.
keep a format equally, not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays.
An idea is what we lack.
it doesn't matter anyways.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.


#Big Long Now

It's not cold enough.
Please put this side up.
She is moving through.
Can we show our faces now?
I'm not interesting.
She's not turning green, shameful as it seems.
Can we show our faces now?
Endless climb.
I am blind.
Why can't I leave?
Color-blind.
Speaking a phrase.
Instantly grown.
I am blind, waiting in line.
It's not cold enough.

Why am I sure?

Even in his youth, even in his youth, even in his youth, he was nothing.

Going nowhere.
Daddy was ashamed.

He was something.
Digrace the family name.

He was born for your crew.
I've got nothing left to prove.
If I die before I wake, hope I don't come back a slave.
