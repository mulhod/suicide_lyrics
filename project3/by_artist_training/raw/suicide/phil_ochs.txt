Do What I Have to Do

All around this country, trouble in the air and I hear the voices calling me, asking, "do you know and do you care?
Do you know and do you care?"
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
Don't want to cause no sorrow.
Don't want to cause no pain.
I'm only going to cause what I have to cause until this land is free of shame, till this land is free of shame.
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
Only one thing I know, I know we're not alone.
Was a million here before we came.
Be a million when we're gone, we're gone, million when we're gone.
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
Oh, I'm afraid of trouble.
yes, I'm afraid of jail.
But I'm more afraid, lord, not to try, more afraid of what happens now if we fail, what happens now if we fail.
So I'm going to do what I have to do, say what I have to say, and I'm going to be what I have to be.
Now, won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?


#The Ballad of Billie Sol

Billie Sol was a man from the giant Texas land.
He put the Chamber of Commerce on a limb.
They voted him the best and the government did no less until the I.O.U.s of Texas fell on him.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
I remember when Bill had influential friends.
He celebrated Christmas every day.
He filled Texas banks with his fertilizer tanks.
Influential friends don't die.
they only fade away.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
The democrats deny and Orville Freeman sighs.
He said, "Everyone around was fair and square."
But He was no more convincing than Ezra Taft Benson as resignations cropped up everywhere.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
And now I'd like to say that crime sure doesn't pay, but, if you want to make some money on the sly, well, you can always rent the U.S. Government.
It's the best one that money can buy.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.


#Colored Town

Just across the railroad tracks, on the far side of the town, all the people there are black and they live in colored town, colored town.
Speeding cars down the highway run.
They never stop to look around.
One place that the highway shuns and that place is colored town, colored town.
On the sidewalk children play.
In the gutters watch them clown.
White world is so far away, so far away from colored town, colored town.
The owners of the local stores, owners of the local ground, they're walking on a finer floor.
Sking. too white for colored town, colored town.
In the early of the day, for the white homes they are bound as a janitor, as a maid.
They leave their place in colored town, colored town.
Come the evening.
come the wine.
Come the dancing music sound.
Liquor knows no color line, not even down in colored town, colored town.
A prison with no prison guards where no padlocks can be found, a jail without cells and bars, but you'll never escape from colored town, colored town.
Come, let's open all the doors from Birmingham to Harlem's ground, from Jackson to Chicago's shores.
Let's take a look at colored town, colored town.
Come take a look at colored town, colored town.


#A.M.A. Song

We are the nation's physicians.
Yes, we give to our lobbies every day.
We will fight against disease when the money comes with ease and, when we get together, we say, "Hooray for A.M.A. and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way.
We've divided up the sections of the body.
Every day we specialize more and more.
But we really love to stitch the diseases of the rich.
We are sure there is a clinic for the poor.
Hooray for the A.M.A and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way and our waiting rooms are getting pretty crowded.
It is sad to see our patients sit and bleed, but, if you must use our ointment, then you must have an appointment or who'll pay for those magazines you read?
Hooray for the A.M.A and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay, higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way and now the government is getting too ambitious.
Yes, we know they want to socialize us all.
Well, our oath was Hippocratic, but with money we're fanatic, so we'll see you in Canada in the fall.
Hooray for the A.M.A. and for us doctors, gluts of higher pay.
If you can't afford my bill, don't you tell me that you're ill because that's the free enterprise way.
AMALGAMATED A.M.A.


#William Moore

Walking down an Alabama road, remembering what the Bible told, walking with a letter in his hand, dreaming of another southern land.
walking down an Alabama road.
And he went by the name of William Moore.
Now what are you doing William Moore?
Why the letter in your hand?
There's only one southern land and he went by the name of William Moore.
What price the glory of one man?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the hopes?
What price the dreams?
And what price the glory of one man?
Remembering what his grandfather done, fought for the south in '61.
A hundred years have passed by since then.
Now Moore is fighting for the south again, remembering what his grandfather done.
Remembering the time in World War II and the South Pacific Island that he knew, remembering the young men that he killed and praying that the guns of hate be stilled.
Remembering the time in World War Two.
What price the glory of one man?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the hopes?
What price the dreams?
And what price the glory of one man?
And they shot him on the Alabama road, forgot about what the Bible told.
They shot him with that letter in his hand as though he were a dog and not a man.
And they shot him on the Alabama road.
Did you say it was a shame when he died?
Did you say he was fool because he tried?
Did you wonder who had fired the gun?
Did you know that it was you who fired the gun?
Did you say "it was a shame" when he died?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the glory of one man?
What price the hopes?
What price the dreams?
And what price the glory of one man?
Walking down an Alabama road.


#Paul Crump

In the state of Illinois about nine years ago a cold-blooded killer, he went against the law.
He killed a factory guard when his robbery did fail and they caught him and they threw him into jail.
He lay there in his cell, locked up with his hate.
Not many men knew of him and less cared for his fate.
And he knew no peace of mind when his trial was coming by.
The judge said, "You are guilty you must die".
But Paul Crump is alive today.
He's sitting in a cell.
he's got something to say.
Every man has got something to give and, if a man can change, then a man should live.
They sent him to Cook County Jail, a jail known far and wide, where pity was a stranger and brave men often cry.
They locked him in the death-row to count the days before to the day they came knocking at his door.
But another warden came along.
Jack Johnson was his name.
He knew how prison living could drive a man to shame.
He had no need of pistols in a solitary cell when a word of trust would help him just as well.
Now Paul Crump is alive today.
He's sitting in a cell.
he's got something to say.
Every man has got something to give and, if a man can change, then a man should live.
Between the warden and the convict, a friendship slowly grew and one learned from the other that a man can live anew.
Then the warden called the convict, "You must leave the devil's plan.
The time has come for you to be a man".
Then the convict found religion and he started him to learn.
He wrote himself a novel called 'Burn, Killer, Burn' and, as his dying day grew near, to the warden he did cry, "You must pull the switch and I must die".
Now Paul Crump is alive today.
He's sitting in a cell.
he's got something to say.
Every man has got something to give and, if a man can change, then a man should live.
It was up to Governor Kerner to keep him from the grave.
Was rehabilitation a reason to be saved?
The hour was coming closer.
the word was spread around.
A new and better answer must be found.
Well, the electric chair was cheated.
the convict didn't pay.
A new concept of justice was born and raised that day.
Now throughout this peaceful land there are others set to die.
What better time than now to question why?
Now Paul Crump is alive today.
He's sitting in a cell.
he's got something to say.
Every man has got something to give and, if a man can change, then a man should live.


#Going Down To Mississippi

I'm going down to Mississippi.
I'm going down a southern road and, if you never see me again, remember that I had to go, remember that I had to go.
It's a long road down to Mississippi.
It's a short road back the other way.
If the cops pull you over to the side of the road, you won't have nothing to say.
No, you won't have nothing to say.
There's a man waiting down in Mississippi and he's waiting with a rifle in his hand and he's looking down the road for an out-of-state car and he thinks he's fighting for his land.
Yes, he thinks he's fighting for his land.
And he won't know the clothes I'm wearing and he doesn't know the name that I own, but his gun is large and his hate is hard and he knows I'm coming down the road.
Yes, he knows I'm coming down the road.
It's not for the glory that I'm leaving.
It's not trouble that I'm looking for.
But there's lots of good work calling me down and the waiting won't do no more.
No, the waiting won't do no more.
Don't call me the brave one for going.
No, don't pin a medal to my name for, even if there was any choice to make, I'd be going down just the same, I'd be going down just the same for someone's got to go to mississippi just as sure as there's a right and there's a wrong.
Even though you say the time will change, that time is just too long, that time is just too long.
So I'm going down to Mississippi.
I'm going down a southern road and, if you never see me again, remember that I had to go, remember that I had to go.


#I'll Be There

When the river of rebellion overflows, I'll be there.
When the seed of discontent plants and grows, I'll be there, watching for the sun through the dark and rainy storm, searching for the keys to the dungeons old and worn.
Let me tell you.
I'll be there.
When the shadow of the tyrant falls and sweeps across the land, when men would steal from others with paper in their hand, when people search for answers and the answers never come, when their troubles would be over if they thought and fought as one, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
Whispering of yesterday has grown into a roar, winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore.
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
When the thunder of oppression roars and crackles, I'll be there.
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there for the day is going to come when they'll throw away their chains, lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains and let me tell you.
I'll be there.
Whispering of yesterday has turned into a roar, winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore.
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear, let me tell you.
I'll be there.
When the thunder of opression roars and crackles, I'll be there.
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there for the day is going to come when they'll throw away their chains, lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains and let me tell you, let me tell you, let me tell you, let me tell you.
I'll be there.


#Ballad of Oxford (Jimmy Meredith)

I'll sing you a song about a southern town where the devil had his rule, when marshals faced an angry mob to send one man to school.
His name was Jimmy Meredith, the tide he helped to turn for he chose to stay on that terrible day the land was soon to learn.
There was blood, red blood, on their hands, yellow dirt on their clothes.
What they thought they were doing only god and the devil knows.
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts, shot from their souls like a gun, and, as they threw their stones and bricks, they screamed, "see what you have done!"
The governor made a promise he would keep the trouble down, but, when the mob got ugly, no troopers could be found and men were filled with hate and fear.
They screamed into the night.
The rebel flag waved in the air, the symbol of states' rights.
There was blood, red blood, on their hands, yellow dirt on their clothes.
What they thought they were doing only god and the devil knows.
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts, shot from their souls like a gun, and, as they threw their stones and bricks, they screamed, "see what you have done!"
Gas was fired into the mob after each attack and, though the gas was running low, they never fired back.
And, when the smoke had cleared and the fury felt its pain, two men were dead and a hundred bled.
The south had risen again.
So listen Mr Barnet and Mr Walker, too.
The times are changing mighty fast.
they'll roll right over you.
But someday you'll head for the south, to the southern tip of hell and it's hot down there, white-hot down there.
Let's hear your rebel yell!
There was blood, red blood, on their hands, yellow dirt on their clothes.
What they thought they were doing only god and the devil knows.
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts, shot from their souls like a gun, and, as they threw their stones and bricks, they screamed, "see what you have done!"
"See what you have done!"


#No Christmas in Kentucky

Christmas shoppers shopping on a neon city street.
Another Christmas dollar for another Christmas treat.
There's satin on the pretty dolls that make the children glow while a boy walking ragged in the cold Kentucky snow.
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky.
There's no holly on a West Virginia door for the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry and the jingle bells don't jingle when you're poor.
There's lots of toys for children when the Christmas time is near, but the present for the miners is a stocking full of beer.
In the dark hills of Kentucky there's one gift that may be found, the coal dust of forgotten days that's lying on the ground.
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky.
There's no holly on a West Virginia door for the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry and the jingle bells don't jingle when you're poor.
Let's drink a toast to congress and a toast to Santa Claus and a toast to all the speeches that bring the loud applause.
There's not enough to give.
no, there's not enough to share, so let's drown the sounds of sorrow with a hearty Christmas cheer.
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky.
There's no holly on a West Virginia door for the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry and the jingle bells don't jingle when you're poor.
Have a merry, merry Christmas and a happy new year's day for now's a time of plenty and plenty's here to stay, but, if you knew what Christmas was, I think that you would find that Christ is spending Christmas in the cold Kentucky mine.
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky.
There's no holly on a West Virginia door for the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry and the jingle bells don't jingle when you're poor.


#A Toast to Those Who Are Gone

Many's the hour I've lain by my window and thought of the people who carried the burden, who marched in the strange fields in search of an answer and ended their journeys an unwilling hero.
Here's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die.
Back in the coal fields of old Harlan county, some talked of the union, some talked of good wages and they lined them up in the dark of the forests and shot them down without asking no questions.
Here's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die.
And over the ocean to the red Spanish soil came the lincoln brigade with their dreams, but they fell in the fire of germany's bombing and they fell because no one would hear their sad warning.
Here's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die.
In old Alabama, in old Mississippi, two states of the union so often found guilty, they came on the buses, they came on the marches, and they lay in the jails or they fell by the highway.
Here's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die.
The state, it was texas, the town, it was Dallas, in the flash of a rifle a life was soon over and nobody thought of the past million murders and the long list of irony had found a new champion.
Here's a song to those who are gone with never a reason why and a toast of the wine at the end of the line and a toll of the bell for the next one to die.


#I'm Tired

Sometimes I feel that the world isn't mine.
It feeds on my hunger and tears on my time.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
Every face on the street is as cold as the air, as hard as the pavement moves beneath my feet.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
Sometimes I stop and ask to myself, oh, why should I be so alone?
It comes and it goes and nobody knows for they're blind with a pain all their own.
So I start out again with a smile on my face to hide all the empty and search for a friend.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
Sometimes I stop and ask to myself, oh, why should I be so alone?
It comes and it goes and nobody knows for they're blind with a pain all their own.
So I start out again with a smile on my face to hide all the empty and search for a friend.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.
And I'm tired.
Yes, I'm tired.


#City Boy

I'm just a city boy, born and bred.
It's a city life I've led.
My pasture was a street.
I've never climbed a tree, but that's alright with me because I'm a city boy.
I'm just a city boy, born and raised.
From these rooftops I have gazed, where the grass was made of steel.
I've never plowed a field.
until the pavement starts to peel, I'll be a city boy.
I'm just a city boy, born and grown.
That's all I've ever known.
Where the lights would greet the dawn, there's a factory for a farm.
Sure, the city has its charm when you're a city boy.


#Song of my Returning

The wild geese are dancing in the ripples of the morn.
My wanderlust is formed.
I've got to follow them wherever they may lead for I am just a sailor on a ship across the land.
Let me hold your hand to bid farewell, so i can knuckle to my
 knee.
but I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the early song of my returning.
The weary world is waiting for ambition to be played, now young and not afraid.
I've got to challenge every chalice that I know.
My eager ears are listening for the singing of the sign.
Deeper are the lines upon the face that finds reflections in the road.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the changing song of my returning.
My drifting days prepare me to do battle with the night, a phantom of the fight.
I've got to conquer all the courage of my fears.
The answer lies in limbo and the harvest will be hard, but sacred are the scars that leave their mark on the fast disolving years.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the changing song of my returning.
Time must have her victory.
It's that I've always known.
But I won or lost alone.
and, when a voice calls out, "there's someone you must meet", with every strength remaining I will suffer one more scene.
I'll gather all my dreams and with my final breath I'll lay them at your feet.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go for it's only love that frees the fire for burning.
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know as I sing the changing song of my returning.


#The Trial

Outside the cats are scratching.
Inside the doors are latching.
On the room, the greedy gloom, the trial is revealed.
Police are six feet deep with switchblades in their teeth, so no one leaves and they all believe this is absolutely real.
Yes, it's real.
And the sergeant says, "Are you ready, boys?
Get ready, boys.
Aim and fire."
Order in the court.
People ready for the sport.
They squirm and squeak and lick their beaks and grease their feathers down.
Everybody rise.
Judge is here with bathroom eyes.
A grizzly bear, he hugs his chair and the greedy gavel pounds.
Yes, it pounds.
And the sergeant says, "Are you ready, boys?
Get ready, boys.
Aim and fire."
In the dungeon falls, writing appeals upon the wall, and the priest in prayers is not even there, so precious is his time.
To the stake he's tied.
The swallows sing.
the triggers slide.
He bids goodbye to the watery sky that plunges from his mind, from his mind.
And the sergeant says, "Are you ready, boys?
Get ready, boys.
Aim and fire."

#One More Parade

Hup, two, three, four, marching down the street, rolling of the drums and the tramping of the feet.
general salutes and the mothers wave and weep.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
One more parade.
So young, so strong, so ready for the war, so willing to go and die upon a foreign shore.
All march together.
everybody looks the same, so there is no one you can blame.
Don't be ashamed.
light the flame.
One more parade.
Listen for the sound and listen for the noise.
Listen for the thunder of the marching boys.
Few years ago their guns were only toys.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
One more parade.
Medals on their coats and guns in their hands.
Trained to kill as they're trained to stand.
Ten thousand ears need only one command.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
One more parade.
Cold hard stares on faces so proud.
Kisses from the girls and cheers from the crowd.
And the widows from the last war cry into their shrouds.
Here comes the big parade.
Don't be afraid.
price is paid.
Don't be ashamed.
war's a game.
World in flames.
So start the parade.


#The Thresher

In Portsmouth town on the eastern shore where many a fine ship was born, the Thresher was built and the Thresher was launched and the crew of the Thresher was sworn.
She was shaped like a tear.
She was built like a shark.
She was made to run fast and free.
And the builders shook their hands and the builders shared their wine.
Thought that they had mastered the sea.
Yes, she'll always run silent and she'll always run deep though the ocean has no pity, though the waves will never weep.
They'll never weep.
And they marveled at her speed and they marveled at her depth and they marveled at her deadly design.
And they sailed to every land and they sailed to every port just to see what faults they could find.
Then they put her on the land for nine months to stand and they worked on her from stem to stern.
But they could never see it was their coffin to be for the sea was waiting for their return.
Yes, she'll always run silent and she'll always run deep though the ocean has no pity, though the waves will never weep.
They'll never weep.
On a cold Wednesday morn they put her out to sea when the waves, they were nine feet high.
And they dove beneath the waves and they dove to their graves and they never said a last goodbye.
And it's deeper and deeper and deeper they dove just to see what their ship could stand.
But the hull gave a moan and the hull gave a groan and they plunged to the deepest, darkest sand.
Now she lies in the depths of the darkened ocean floor, covered by the waters cold and still.
Oh, can't you see the wrong?
She was a death ship all along.
Died before she had a chance to kill.
And she'll never run silent and she'll never run deep for the ocean had no pity and the waves they never weep.
They never weep.


#Talking Vietnam

Sailing over to Vietnam, Southeast Asian Birmingham.
Well, training is the word we use.
Nice word to have in case we lose.
Training a million Vietnamese to fight for the wrong government and the American Way.
Well, they put me in a barracks house just across the way from Laos.
They said you're pretty safe when the troops deploy, but don't turn your back on your house, boy.
When they ring the gong, watch out for the Viet-Cong.
Well, the sergeant said it's time to train, so I climbed aboard my helicopter plane.
We flew above the battle-ground.
A sniper tried to shoot us down.
He must have forgotten we're only trainees.
Them Commies never fight fair.
Friends, the very next day we trained some more.
We burned some villages down to the floor.
Yes, we burned out the jungles far and wide.
Made sure those red apes had no place left to hide.
Threw all the people in relocation camps under lock and key.
made damn sure they're free.
Well, I walked through the jungle and around the bend.
Who should I meet but President Diem.
Said you're fighting to keep Vietnam free for good old Diem-ocracy.
That means rule by one family and 15,000 American troops, give or take a few.
Thousand American troops.


#Lou Marsh

On the streets of New York city when the hour was getting late, there were young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hate.
And Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks for one man is no army when the city turns its back.
And now the streets are empty.
Now the streets are dark, so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night.
He left behind a chamber of a church he served so long for he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs.
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street and he made his congregation from the boys he used to meet.
And now the streets are empty.
Now the streets are dark, so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night.
There were two gangs approaching in Spanish Harlem town.
The smell of blood was in the air.
The challenge was laid down.
He felt their blinding hatred and he tried to save their lives and the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives.
And now the streets are empty.
Now the streets are dark, so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night.
Will Lou Marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave?
Will his memory still linger on in those he tried to save?
All of us who knew him will now and then recall and shed a tear on poverty, tombstone of us all, for now the streets are empty.
Now the streets are dark, so keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park for the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight and death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night.


#Power and the Glory

Come and take a walk with me through this green and growing land.
Walk through the meadows and the mountains and the sand.
Walk through the valleys and the rivers and the plains.
Walk through the sun and walk through the rain.
Here is a land full of power and glory, beauty that words cannot recall.
Oh, her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom.
Her glory shall rest on us all, on us all.
From Colorado, Kansas, and the Carolinas too, Virginia and Alaska, from the old to the new, Texas and Ohio and the California shore, tell me, who could ask for more?
Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor, only as free as the padlocked prison door, only as strong as our love for this land, only as tall as we stand.
But our land is still troubled by men who have to hate.
They twist away our freedom and they twist away our fate.
Fear is their weapon and treason is their cry.
We can stop them if we try.


#Celia

When the wind from the island is rolling through the trees, when a kiss from a prison cell is carried in the breeze, that's when I wonder how sad a man can be.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?
I still remember the mountains of the war, Sierra Madre and the Philipino shore.
When will I lie beside my Celia beneath the trees?
Oh, when will Celia come to me?
So many years were stolen.
so many years are gone.
And the vision of my Celia make dreams to dream upon.
Each hour is a day filled with memories.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?
I wake each morning and I watch the sun arise, wonder if my Celia sleeps, wonder if she cries.
If hate must be my prison lock, love must be the key.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?
The guns have stopped their firing.
you may wander through the hills.
They kept my Celia through the war.
they keep her from me still.
She waits upon island now, a prisoner of the sea.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?
When the wind from the island is rolling through the trees, when a kiss from a prison cell is carried in the breeze, that's when I wonder how sad a man can be.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?
Oh, when will Celia come to me?


#The Bells

Hear the sledges with the bells, silver bells.
What a world of merriment their melody foretells.
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle in the icy air of night.
All the heavens seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight.
Keeping time, time, time with a sort of Runic rhyme from the tintinnabulation that so musically wells from the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Hear the mellow wedding bells, golden bells.
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells.
Through the balmy air of night how they ring out their delight, through the dances and the yells and the rapture that impels.
How it swells.
How it dwells.
On the future how it tells from the swinging and the ringing of the molten golden bells, of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, of the rhyming and the chiming of the bells.
Hear the loud alarum bells, brazen bells.
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells.
Much too horrified to speak, oh, they can only shriek for all the ears to know how the danger ebbs and flows, leaping higher, higher, higher with a desperate desire, in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, with the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, with the clamor and the clanging of the bells.
Hear the tolling of the bells, iron bells.
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels for all the sound that floats from the rust within our throats.
And the people sit and groan in their muffled monotone and the tolling, tolling, tolling feels a glory in the rolling from the throbbing and the sobbing of the melancholy bells, oh, the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, oh, the moaning and the groaning of the bells.


#Automation Song

Oh, I laid down your railroads, every mile of track, with the muscles on my arm and the sweat upon my back.
and now the trains are rolling.
they roll to every shore.
You tell me that my job is through.
there be not no work no more.
Though I laid down your highways all across the land with the ringing of the steel and the power of my hands and now the roads are there like ribbons in the sky, you tell me that my job is through, but still I wonder why for the wages were low and the hours were long and the labor was all I could bear.
Now you've got new machines for to take my place and you tell me it's not mine to share.
Though I laid down your factories and laid down your fields with my feet on the ground and my back to your wheels and now the smoke is rising, the steel is all a-glow, I'm walking down a jobless road and where am I to go? for the wages were low and the hours were long and the labor was all I could bear.
Now you've got new machines for to take my place and you tell me it's not mine to share.
Though I laid down your factories and laid down your fields with my feet on the ground and my back to your wheels and now the smoke is rising, the steel is all a-glow , I'm walking down a jobless road and where am I to go?
Tell me, where am I to go?


#Ballad of William Worthy

Well, it's of a bold reporter whose story I will tell.
He went down to the Cuban land, the nearest place to hell.
He'd been there many times before, but now the law does say the only way to Cuba is with the C.I.A.
William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door.
Went down to Cuba.
he's not American anymore.
But somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world.
in the free world you must stay.
Five thousand dollars or a five year sentence may well be for a man who had the nerve to think that traveling is free.
Oh, why'd he waste his time to see a dictator's reign when he could have seen democracy by traveling on to Spain?
William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door.
Went down to Cuba.
he's not American anymore.
But somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world.
in the free world you must stay.
So, come all you good travelers and fellow travelers too, yes, and travel all around the world, see every country through.
I'd surely like to come along and see what may be new, but my passport's disappearing as I sing these words to you.
Well, there really is no need to travel to these evil lands.
Yes, and, though the list grows larger, you must try to understand.
try hard not to worry if someday you should hear the whole world is off limits.
visit Disneyland this year.
William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door.
Went down to Cuba.
he's not American anymore.
But somehow it is strange to hear the state department say you are living in the free world.
in the free world you must stay.


#Knock on the Door

In many a time, in many a land, with many a gun in many a hand, they came by the night, they came by the day, came with their guns to take us away.
With a knock on the door, knock on the door, here they come to take one more, one more.
Back in the days of the Roman Empire, they died by the cross and they died by the fire.
In the stone coliseum, the crowd gave a roar and it all began with that knock on the door, just a knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more, one more.
The years have all passed.
we've reached modern times.
The Nazis have come with their Nazi war crimes.
Yes, the power was there.
the power was found.
Six million people have heard that same sound, that old knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more, one more.
Now there's many new words and many new names, the banners have changed, but the knock is the same.
On the Soviet shores with right on their side, I wonder who knows how many have died.
with their knock on the door, knock on the door, here they come to take one more one more.
Look over the oceans.
look over the lands.
Look over the leaders with the blood on their hands.
And open your eyes and see what they do.
When they knock over their friend, they're knocking for you.
With their knock on the door, knock on the door, here they come to take one more.
With their knock on the door, knock on the door, here they come to take one more, one more. 


#Talking Cuban Crisis

It was just a little while ago, I glued my ears to the radio.
The announcer was saying we'd better beware.
A crisis was hanging, a wave up in the air, crawling on the ground, swimming in the sea, heading for me.
Well, I didn't know if I was for or against it.
He was yelling and screaming a mile a minute.
Well, he said, "Here comes the President,
But first this word from Pepsodent.
Have whiter teeth, have cleaner breath when you're facing nuclear death".
And then President John began to speak and I knew right away he wouldn't be weak.
Well, he said he'd seen some missile bases and terrible smiles on Cuban faces, close pictures, carrying land reform too far, giving land to the USSR.
Well, he said we mustn't be afraid.
We're setting up a little blockade.
Put our ships along the Cuban shores and if the Russian bear yells and roars, we'll let him have it.
From Turkey and Greece, Formosa and Spain, the peaceful West European Plain, from Alaska and Greenland we'll use our means and twenty thousand submarines.
We're going to teach the Russians a lesson for trying to upset the balance of power.
Now most Americans stood behind the President and his military minds, but me, I stood behind a bar, dreaming of a spaceship getaway car.
Head for mars, any other planet that has bars, like Gerde's Folk City.
Yes, it seemed the stand was strong and plain, but some Republicans was going insane and they still are.
well, they said our plan was just too mild.
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Let's sink Cuba into the sea and give them back democracy under the water.
Well, the deadline was set for ten o'clock.
for a cold war, it was a getting hot.
Well, the Russians tried.
the Russians failed.
Homeward-bound those missiles sailed.
Mr. Khruschev said, "Better Red than dead".


#Bound for Glory

He walked all over his own growing land from the New York island to the California sand.
He saw all the people that needed to be seen, planted all the grass where it needed to be green.
and now he's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory.
He wrote and he sang and he rode upon the rails and he got on board when the sailors had to sail.
He said all the words that needed to be said.
He fed all the hungry souls that needed to be fed.
and now he's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory.
He sang in our streets and he sang in our halls and he was always there when the unions gave a call.
He did all the jobs that needed to be done.
He always stood his ground when a smaller man would run.
and now he's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory.
And it's "Pastures of Plenty", wrote the dustbowl balladeer.
And "This Land is Your Land" he wanted us to hear.
And the rising of the unions will be sung about again and the Deportees live on through the power of his pen.
and now he's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory.
Now they sing out his praises on every distant shore, but so few remember what he was fighting for.
Oh, why sing the songs and forget about the aim?
He wrote them for a reason.
why not sing them for the same?
and now he's bound for a glory all his own and now he is bound for glory.


#Too Many Martyrs

In the state of Mississippi many years ago, a boy of 14 years got a taste of southern law.
He saw his friend hanging and his color was his crime and the blood upon his jacket left a brand upon his mind.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
His name was Medgar Evers and he walked his road alone like Emmett Till and thousands more whose names we'll never know.
They tried to burn his home and they beat him to the ground, but deep inside they both knew what it took to bring him down.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
The killer waited by his home hidden by the night as Evers stepped out from his car into the rifle sight.
he slowly squeezed the trigger.
the bullet left his side.
It struck the heart of every man when Evers fell and died.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.
And they laid him in his grave while the bugle sounded clear, laid him in his grave when the victory was near, while we waited for the future for freedom through the land.
The country gained a killer and the country lost a man.
Too many martyrs and too many dead, too many lies, too many empty words were said.
Too many times for too many angry men.
Oh, let it never be again.


#What's That I Hear

What's that I hear now ringing in my ear?
I've heard that sound before.
What's that I hear now ringing in my ear?
I hear it more and more.
It's the sound of freedom calling, ringing up to the sky.
It's the sound of the old ways falling.
You can hear it if you try.
You can hear it if you try.
What's that I see now shining in my eyes?
I've seen that light before.
What's that I see now shining in my eyes?
I see it more and more.
It's the light of freedom shining, shining up to the sky.
It's the light of the old ways dying.
You can see it if you try
What's that I feel now beating in my heart?
I've felt that beat before.
What's that I feel now beating in my heart?
I feel it more and more.
It's the rumble of freedom calling, climbing up to the sky.
It's the rumble of the old ways falling.
You can feel it if you try.


#Bullets of Mexico

The peons of Mexico long have known suffering and pain.
Zapata and Villa have died there, fighting in vain.
Ruben Jaramillo kept up the tradition.
He fought for the land once again.
He lived for the land and there on the land he was slain.
A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun, but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.
The greedy capiques have stolen and plundered the land.
with pistoleros they ruled with a cold iron hand.
The poor campesinos could stand it no longer.
Resistance was starting to grow.
Jaramillo decided to fight for a new Mexico.
A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun, but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.
For twenty long years he fought and he struggled and tried, Effe Bonilla, his wife always there at his side.
Often surrounded, he always was hounded.
They searched for him near, far and wide.
A man of deep sorrow, but also a man of deep pride.
A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun, but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.
Two thousand peasants he led to their long-Promised Land and the army's revenge killed the wife and the sons and the man.
His assassins rejoiced with their whiskey and women.
They laughed and they danced on his grave.
Now the land waits again for another to ride on the wave.
A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun, but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.

#One Way Ticket Home

I'd like a one-way ticket home, ticket home, where I can watch television, talk on the telephone.
But every town I wander there's a billboard on a throne.
Ticket home, I want a ticket home.
Does anybody know my name or recognize my face?
I must have come from somewhere, but I can't recall the place.
They dropped me at the matinee.
they left without a trace.
Ticket home, I want a ticket home.
Elvis Presley is the king.
I was at his crowning.
My life just flashed before my eyes.
I must be drowning.
Seems like only yesterday I climbed aboard the plane, raping distance in the skies, while diving in champagne.
I would be in exile now, but everywhere's the same.
Ticket home, I want a ticket home.
Elvis Presley is the king.
I was at his crowning.
My life just flashed before my eyes.
I must be drowning.
Seems like only yesterday I climbed aboard the plane, raping distance in the sky while diving in champagne.
I would be in exile now, but everywhere's the same.
Ticket home, I want a ticket home.


#Jim Dean of Indiana

It was on an Indiana farm in the middle of the country, growing in the fields of grain, Jim Dean of Indiana.
His mother died when he was a boy.
his father was a stranger.
Marcus Winslow took him in.
nobody seemed to want him.
The hired man sang like a storm.
sometimes he'd beat him because he would never do the chores.
he was lost in dreaming.
He never seemed to find a play with the flatlands and the farmers, so he had to leave one day, he said to be an actor.
Once he'd come back to the farm with starlets from the stages.
They locked themselves inside his room.
the people turned their faces.
A neighbor ran from the movie-house.
chickens they were scattered.
He swore he saw upon the screen, Jim Dean of Indiana.
He played a boy without a home, torn with no tomorrow, reaching out to touch someone, a stranger in the shadow.
The Winslows left for the movie town.
they drove across the country.
They hoped that he would stay around and they hoped he would be friendly.
He talked to them for half an hour, but he was busy racing.
He left for the Grapevine Road 1.
they left for Indiana.
Then Marcus heard on the radio that a movie-star was dying.
He turned the tuner way down low, so Ortense could go on sleeping.
It was not until they reached the farm where the hired man was waiting.
The wind rushed silent through the grain.
it was just as they had told him.
They buried him just down the road, a mile from the farmhouse.
That is where I placed a flower for Jim Dean of Indiana.


#My Kingdom for a Car

I've found my freedom.
Her and I been flying down that highway of gold.
My shirtsleeves are rolled.
my Colt 45 is cold.
I go fast till I'm going faster.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
How I love the highway.
Picks me up and takes me wherever I please.
I race through the trees, bring space to her knees.
I am master of all that's flying past me.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
Take me to tomorrow.
Let me go on racing with the wind in my hair.
There's smoke in the air, but I do not care.
If you want me, you will have to pass me.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
Come to me, baby.
We will leave this town.
it was not made for a man.
We'll find a new land, but the traffic is jammed.
I went far, but it's a time for walking.
Look how far we've come, look how far.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.
A car, a car, my kingdom for a car.


#Boy in Ohio

Creek was running by the road and the Buckeye sun was shining.
I rode my bike down Alum Creek Drive when I was a boy in Ohio.
The English teacher, he didn't care.
He challenged us to checkers and once in a while we'd swap a joke.
When I was a boy in Ohio, once I was caught playing hooky from school.
They found me home in the evening.
I confessed I had been to the movie show when I was a boy in Ohio.
We would wait for the summer to come, for swimming and picking berries, but now a freeway covers the field where I used to be so happy.
I remember the Burger Boy, where the girls would shine like the engines and the radio was always loud when I was a boy in Ohio.
Spanish teacher, she tried to help.
She was much too pretty, so I just stared at the back of her legs when I was a boy in Ohio.
It was beer at the honkytonk bar where they said the girls were easy, but somehow I never found me one when I was a boy in Ohio.
Soon I was grown and I had to leave and I've been all over the country, but I don't believe I've had more fun than when I was a boy in Ohio.


#Gas Station Women

Everything is going wrong.
everything is bad.
There's no one I can talk to when I am feeling sad.
She broke my heart a million ways.
I'm losing all my friends.
The boys down at the factory ask me where I've been.
Fill her up with love, please, won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say, but that was before I lost my baby.
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today.
I never should have left my home, never left the farm, but the city was excitin.
it couldn't do me any harm.
The more folks I run across, the less I seem to know.
The days go by too quickly.
the nights go by too slow.
Fill her up with love, please, won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say, but that was before I lost my baby.
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today.
I cannot face another girl.
I believe I'll turn to drink, so I won't remember, so I won't have to think.
Tomorrow will bring happiness or at least another day, so I will bid farewell and I'll be on my way.
Fill her up with love, please, won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say, but that was before I lost my baby.
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today.


#Chords of Fame

I found him by the stage last night.
He was breathing his last breath.
A bottle of gin and a cigarette was all that he had left.
I can see you make the music because you carry a guitar, but, God, help the troubadour who tries to be a star.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
I've seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world.
When they find their melody, they're surrounded by the girls.
But it all fades so quickly, like a sunny summer day.
Reporters ask you questions.
They write down what you say.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.
They will rob you of your innocence.
They will put you up for sale.
More that you will find success, the more that you will fail.
I've been around.
I've had my share and I really can't complain, but I wonder who I left behind the other side of fame.
So play the chords of love, my friend.
Play the chords of pain.
If you want to keep your song, don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame.


#Ten Cents a Coup

It was a used car dealer's election and the choice was rather small.
The boys agreed, "It's the war we need, so there's no president at all."
Here's to Nixon and Agnew.
They are the stars of the stage and screen.
Not since Laurel and Hardy have I laughed so hard I screamed.
I thought that Johnson was the devil.
I thought we couldn't do no worse.
Now the White House stands in Disneyland.
This country must be under a curse.
Here's to Nixon and Agnew.
They are the stars of the stage and screen.
Not since Laurel and Hardy have I laughed so hard I screamed.
I dreamed that Nixon died of a sun-tan.
There was only Spiro left.
at his swearing-in, he fell on his chin.
He assassinated himself.
Here's to Nixon and Agnew.
They are the stars of the stage and screen.
Not since Laurel and Hardy have I laughed so hard I screamed.


#Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Me

Every morning at the dawn dust is in the air.
Karen rises early, runs brushes through her hair.
Then she buys the paper.
I lay on my back.
Then she feeds the monkey.
then she feeds the cat.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
Frances is the next to rise.
Powders up her nose.
She's working for the tailor.
Makes the western clothes.
Andy drives a sports car to the Warner Brothers ghost.
He used to live in England.
Now he loves the coast.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
Sometimes a friend comes by to sing the latest song, but David fights with Susan.
Nobody gets along.
Every other Sunday it's time to make a call.
Judy has a barbecue.
Play the volleyball.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
In the evening when the sun goes down, the streets are all aglow.
We walk out on the hillside.
City shines below.
We sit down for our supper.
The news begins to play.
Walter, he is speechless.
Eric speaks cliches.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.
Andy plays a cricket game.
Frances holds a glass.
Karen reads and darns a dress.
I dream of the past.
Dark is spreading up now.
Good evening, goodnight.
Karen turns the bed sheet.
She's turning out the light.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
they live by the sea, surrounded by a cemetery.
If you get tired, come up for some tea with Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me.

 
#Basket in the Pool

Went to a party the other night.
everybody was there.
Thought that I would have some fun as I started up the stair.
Somebody tried to ruin it when he won a raffle prize.
Tried to shake and shock us right before our eyes.
While we danced, while we were dancing, who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
It was filled with the finest cheeses, filled with imported wine.
Wish that I had won it and I wish that it were mine.
I know some wino lives outside of town who would gladly cut your throat if he could drink it down.
While we danced, while we were dancing, who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
If I had found out who he was, if I'd have found his face, next time we have a party going to find out his name.
I've been on the ocean swimming.
know porpoise led the way.
It wasn't worth the matter and it wasn't worth the pay.
We were there, go right on dancing.
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
How can I go swimming now?
My world is laid to waste.
It was the worst of manners and it was the worst of taste.
Why can't we be left alone?
Think that it was a crime.
If everyone was groovy, we could all have a real good time.
We could dance, go right on dancing.
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?


#No More Songs

Hello, hello, hello, is there anybody home?
I've only called to say, I'm sorry.
The drums are in the dawn and all the voices gone and it seems that there are no more songs.
Once I knew a girl.
she was a flower in a flame.
I loved her as the sea sings sadly.
Now the ashes of the dream can be found in the magazines and it seems that there are no more songs.
Once I knew a sage who sang upon the stage.
He told about the world, his lover, a ghost without a name, stands ragged in the rain and it seems that there are no more songs.
The rebels, they were here.
they came beside the door.
They told me that the moon was bleeding.
Then all to my surprise they took away my eyes and it seems that there are no more songs.
A star is in the sky.
it's time to say goodbye.
A whale is on the beach.
he's dying.
A white flag in my hand and a white bone in the sand and it seems that there are no more songs.
Hello, hello, hello, is there anybody home?
I've only called to say, I'm sorry.
The drums are in the dawn and all the voices gone and it seems that there are no more songs.
It seems that there are no more songs.
It seems that there are no more songs.

#I Ain't Marching Anymore

Oh, I marched to the battle of New Orleans at the end of the early British war 
The young land started growing.
The young blood started flowing.
but I be not marching anymore for I've killed my share of Indians in a thousand different fights.
I was there at the Little Big Horn.
I heard many men lying.
I saw many more dying.
But I be not marching anymore.
It's always the old to lead us to the war.
It's always the young to fall.
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun.
Tell me, is it worth it all? for I stole California from the Mexican land, fought in the bloody Civil War.
Yes, I even killed my brothers and so many others.
But I be not marching anymore for I marched to the battles of the German trench in a war that was bound to end all wars.
Oh, I must have killed a million men and now they want me back again.
But I be not marching anymore.
It's always the old to lead us to the war.
It's always the young to fall.
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun.
Tell me, is it worth it all? for I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky, set off the mighty mushroom roar.
When I saw the cities burning, I knew that I was learning that I be not marching anymore.
Now the labor leader's screaming when they close the missile plants.
United Fruit screams at the Cuban shore.
call it Peace or call it Treason, call it Love or call it Reason, but I be not marching anymore, no, I be not marching anymore.


#In the Heat of the Summer

In the heat of the summer, when the pavements were burning, the soul of a city was ravaged in the night after the city sun was sinking.
Why, the windows were shattered, but deep in the dark someone set the spark and then it no longer mattered.
All the tempers were raging.
Oh, where, oh, where are the white silver tongues who forgot to listen to the warnings?
No longer following reason and all the stores were the target now where just the other day they were buying.
Drunk with the lure of the looting and the memory of the uniforms shoving with their sticks, asking, "Are you looking for trouble?"
"It's not the way of the order.
Oh, stay in your homes.
please leave us alone.
We'll be glad to talk in the morning."
"Why the hurry to your hunger?
Now the rubble's resting on your broken streets, so you see what your rage has unraveled".
Bricks were heavily flying and the loudspeaker drowned like a whispering sound when compared to the angered emotions.
And the shame was replacing the anger, so wrong, so wrong, but we've been down so long and we had to make somebody listen in the heat of the summer.


#Draft Dodger Rag

Oh, I'm just a typical American boy from a typical American town.
I believe in God and Senator Dodd and keeping old Castro down.
And, when it came my time to serve, I knew "better dead than red".
But, when I got to my old draft board, buddy, this is what I said.
Sarge, I'm only eighteen.
I got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse.
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt.
Besides, I be not no fool, I'm going to school, and I'm working in a defense plant.
I've got a dislocated disc and a wracked-up back.
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs.
And, when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits and I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.
I got the weakness woes.
I can't touch my toes.
I can hardly reach my knees.
And, if the enemy came close to me, I'd probably start to sneeze.
Sarge, I'm only eighteen.
I got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse.
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt.
Besides, I be not no fool, I'm going to school, and I'm working in a defense plant.
Oh, I hate Chou En Lai and I hope he dies.
One thing you got to see, that someone's got to go over there, and that someone isn't me, so I wish you well, Sarge.
give them Hell!
Kill me a thousand or so.
And, if you ever get a war without blood and gore, I'll be the first to go.
Yes, I'm only eighteen.
I got a ruptured spleen and I always carry a purse.
I got eyes like a bat and my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse.
Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt.
Besides, I be not no fool, I'm going to school, and I'm working in a defense plant.


#That's What I Want to Hear

Oh, you tell me that your last good dollar is gone and you say that your pockets are bare.
And you tell me that your clothes are tattered and torn and nobody seems to care.
Now, don't tell me your troubles.
No, I don't have the time to spare.
But, if you want to get together and fight, good buddy, that's what I want to hear.
And you tell me that your job was taken away by a big old greasy machine.
And you tell me that you don't collect no more pay and your belly is growing lean.
Now, if I had the jobs to give, you know I'd give them all away.
But don't waste your breath calling out my name if you don't have nothing to say.
And you tell me that you don't have nothing to do and you keep on wasting your time.
And you say when you want to get your family some food, you got to stand in a relief line.
Now, it's a sin and a bloody shame about the way they're pushing you around, but, when you decide not to take no more, you know I'll put my money down because I've seen your kind many times before and I'll see them many times again.
Oh, but every bad thing that's happened to you has happened to better men, so don't explain that you've lost your way, that you've got no place to go.
You've got a hand and a voice and you're not alone.
Brother, that's all you need to know.
And, if you're still wondering what I'm trying to say, let me tell you what it's all about.
Now, nobody listens to a single man when he's walking around down and out, so, if you're looking for an answer, he's standing there by your side and you'll never really know how far you'll go till you join together and try.
So, you tell me that your last good dollar is gone and you say that your pockets are bare.
And you tell me that your clothes are tattered and torn and nobody seems to care.
Now, don't tell me your troubles.
No, I don't have the time to spare.
But, if you want to get together and fight, good buddy, that's what I want to hear.


#That Was the President

The bullets of the false revenge have struck us once again as the angry seas have struck upon the sand and it seemed as though a friendless world had lost itself a friend.
That was the President and that was the man.
I still can see him smiling there and waving at the crowd as he drove through the music of the band and never even knowing no more time would be allowed, not for the President and not for the man.
Here's a memory to share.
here's a memory to save of the sudden early ending of command.
Yet a part of you and a part of me is buried in his grave.
That was the President and that was the man.
It's not only for the leader that the sorrow hits so hard.
There are greater things I'll never understand.
How a man so filled with life, even death was caught off guard.
That was the President and that was the man.
Everything he might have done and all he could have been was proven by the troubled traitor's hand for what other death could wound the hearts of so many men?
That was the President and that was the man.
Yes, the glory that was Lincoln's never died when he was slain.
It's been carried over time and time again and to the list of honor you may add another name.
That was the President and that was the man.
That was the President and that was the man.
On a South Pacific ocean, on a South Pacific shore, a legend was written on the sand for a man of peace was born in the middle of a war.


#Iron Lady

Have you seen the iron lady's charms, legs of steel, leather on her arms, taking on a man to die?
A life for a life.
an eye for an eye.
And death's the iron lady in the chair.
Stop the murder.
deter the crimes away.
Only killing shows that killing doesn't pay.
Yes, that's the kind of law it takes even though we make mistakes and sometimes send the wrong man to the chair.
In the death-row waiting for their turn, no time to change, not a chance to learn, waiting for someone to call, say, "it's over, after all."
They won't have to face the justice of the chair.
Just before they serve him one last meal, shave his head, they ask him how he feels.
Then the warden comes to say goodbye.
Reporters come to watch him die, watch him as he's strapped into the chair.
And the chaplain, he reads the final prayer.
Be brave, my son.
the Lord is waiting there.
Oh, murder is so wrong, you see.
Both the Bible and the courts agree that the state's allowed to murder in the chair.
In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales.
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals.
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed, the finest lawyers' fees are paid and a rich man never died upon the chair.
Have you seen the iron lady's charms, legs of steel, leather on her arms, taking on a man to die?
A life for a life.
an eye for an eye.
And death's the iron lady in the chair.


#The Highwayman

The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas and the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor and the highwayman came riding, riding, riding.
Yes, the highwayman came riding up to the old inn door.
Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the darkened yard and he tapped with his whip at the window, but all was locked and barred.
so he whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting there but the landlord's black-eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughter, plaiting a dark-red love knot into her long black hair.
One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, for I'm after
 a prize tonight.
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light.
Yet if they press me sharply, harry me through the day, oh, then look for me by moonlight.
watch for me by moonlight and I'll come to thee by moonlight though Hell should bar the way.
He did not come at the dawning.
No, he did not come at the noon.
And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon, when the road was a gypsy's ribbon looping the purple moor, oh, a redcoat troop came marching, marching, marching, King George's men came marching up to the old inn door and they bound the landlord's daughter with many a sniggering jest and they bound the musket beside her with the barrel beneath her breast.
Now keep good watch.
and they kissed her.
She heard the dead man say, "Oh, look for me by moonlight.
Watch for me by moonlight and I'll come to thee by moonlight though Hell should bar the way."
Look for me by moonlight, hoof-beats ringing clear.
Watch for me by moonlight.
Were they deaf that they did not hear? for he rode on the gypsy highway.
She breathed one final breath.
Then her finger moved in the moonlight.
Her musket shattered the moonlight and it shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death.
Oh, he turned.
he spurred on to the west.
He did not know who stood out with her black hair flowing down, drenched with her own red blood.
Oh, not till the dawn had he heard it and his face grew gray to hear how Bess the landlord's daughter, the landlord's black-eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight and died in the darkness there.
Back he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high.
Blood-red were his spurs in the golden noon, wine-red his velvet coat when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway with a bunch of lace at his throat.
And still on a winter's night they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, oh, the highwayman comes riding, riding, riding.
Yes, the highwayman comes riding up to the old inn door.


#Links on the Chain

Come, you ranks of labor, come, you union core, and see if you remember the struggles of before, when you were standing helpless on the outside of the door and you started building links on the chain, on the chain, you started building links on the chain, wWhen the police on the horses were waiting on demand, riding through the strike with the pistols in their hands, swinging at the skulls of many a union man as you built one more link on the chain, on the chain, as you built one more link on the chain.
Then the army of the fascists tried to put you on the run, but the army of the union, they did what could be done.
Oh, the power of the factory was greater than the gun as you built one more link on the chain, on the chain, as you built one more link on the chain.
And then in 1954, decisions finally made, the black man was rising fast and racing from the shade and your union took no stand and your union was betrayed, as you lost yourself a link on the chain, on the chain, as you lost yourself a link on the chain.
And then there came the boycotts and then the freedom rides and, forgetting what you stood for, you tried to block the tide.
Oh, the automation bosses were laughing on the side, as they watched you lose your link on the chain, on the chain, as they watched you lose your link on the chain.
You know when they block your trucks, boys, by laying on the road, all that they are doing is all that you have showed, that you got to strike, you got to fight to get what you are owed when youre building all your links on the chain, on the chain, when youre building all your links on the chain.
And the man who tries to tell you that theyll take your job away, hes the same man who was scabbing hard just the other day and your unions not a union till hes thrown out of the way and hes choking on your links of the chain, of the chain, and hes choking on your links of the chain for now the times are telling you the times are rolling on and youre fighting for the same thing, the jobs that will be gone.
Now, its only fair to ask you, boys, which side are you on? as youre building all your links on the chain, on the chain, as youre building all your links on the chain.


#Hills of West Virginia

From the flat plains of Ohio we drifted out one day for the southern part of the journey.
Underneath the bridge, the Ohio River sang as we headed for the Hills of West Virginia.
And the red sun of the morning was smiling through the trees as the darkness of the night was quickly fading and the fog hugged the road like a cloudy, cloudy sea as we drove though the hills of West Virginia.
We smoked the tobacco and drank of the wine and we spoke of the forest we were passing.
And the road would wind and wind and wind when we drove through the hills of West Virginia.
Among all the wealth of the beauty that we passed, there was many old shacks growing older.
And we saw the broken bottles laying on the grass when we drove though the hills of West Virginia.
The Virginia people watched as we went riding by.
Oh, proud as a boulder they were standing.
And we wondered at each other with a meeting of the eye when we drove thought the hills of West Virginia.
And once in a while we would stop by the road and gaze at the womb of the valley, almost wishing for a path down below, where we stopped in the hills of West Virginia.
Up and down and all around we took our restless ride and the rocks, they were staring cold and jagged, where explosions of the powder had torn away the side, where we drove through the hills of West Virginia.
And the orange sun was falling on the southern border-line as the shadows of the night were now returning.


#The Men Behind the Guns

Let's drink a toast to the admiral and here's to the captain bold and glory more for the commodore when the deeds of might are told.
They stand to the deck with the battle's wreck when the great shells roar and pound and never they fear when the foe is near to lay their orders down.
But off with your hats and three times three for every sailor's son, for the men below who fight the foe, the men behind the guns, oh, the man behind the guns.
Their hearts pounding heavy when they swing to port once more, with never enough of the greenback stuff they start for the leave ashore.
And you'd think perhaps the blue-blouse chaps had better clothes to wear for the uniforms of officers could hardly be compared.
Warriors bold with straps of gold that dazzle like the sun outshine the common sailor boys, the lads who serve the guns, oh, the men behind the guns.
But say not a word till the shot is heard that tells the fight is on and the angry sound of another round says there must be gone over the deep and the deadly sweep, oh, the fire and the bursting shell, where the very air is a mad despair, the throes of a living hell.
But down and deep in a mighty ship, unseen by the midday sun, oh, you'll find the boys who make the noise, the lads who serve the guns, oh, the men behind the guns.
And, well, they know the cyclone blow loose from the cannon's steel and they know the hull of the enemy ship will quiver with the peal and the decks will rock with the lightning shock and shake with the great recoil while the sea grows red with the blood of the dead and swallows up her spoil.
But not until the final ship has made her final run can we give their rest to the very best, the lads who serve the guns, oh, the men behind the guns.
So let's drink a toast to the admiral and here's to the captain bold and glory more for the commodore when the deeds of might are told.
They stand to the deck with the battle's wreck when the great shells roar and pound and never they fear when the foe is near to lay their orders down.
But off with your hats and three times three for every sailor's son, for the men below who fight the foe, the men behind the guns, oh, the man behind the guns.


#Talking Birmingham Jam

Walking down to Birmingham, way down south in Dixie-land, oh, I thought that I would stop awhile, take a vacation southern-style.
Got some southern hospitality down there in a southern hospital.
Oh, all the signs said welcome in, signed by Governor Wallace and Rin-Tin-Tin.
They said come along and watch the fights while we feed our dogs on civil rights.
Now, don't get us wrong.
Some of our best Negroes are friends.
Well, I've seen traveling many ways.
I've traveled in cars and old subways.
But in Birmingham some people chose to fly down the street from a fire-hose, doing some hard traveling from hydrants of plenty.
Well, a pack of dogs was standing by.
I walked up to them and I said, "Hi".
I asked one dog what they all were doing.
He walked up to me and started chewing.
I said, "Hold it.
I'm from the A.S.P.C.A., Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Agitators".
And I said, "There must be some men around.
There can't be only you dogs in town".
They said, "sure, we have old Bull Conner.
There he goes walking yonder."
Throwing some raw meat to the Mayor, feeding bones to the city council, you know Governor Wallace doesn't mean no harm.
Can't you see he's got a lot of charm?
He's protecting us whites, both the rich and poor, standing in the schoolhouse door, cracking jokes, talking to Huntley Brinkley, serving jury duty, getting re-elected.
So, I asked them why they spent their time with segregation on their mind.
They said, "If you don't like to live this way, gGet out of here.
go back to the U.S.A.
Live with all them Russians and New York folksingers."
Some say they're past their darkest hour.
Those moderates are back in power.
Oh, they listen close with open ears.
They'll
 help us out in a couple of hundred years.
But don't push them, whatever you do, or else you'll get those extremists back in.
You see, Alabama is a sovereign state with sovereign dogs and sovereign hate.
They stand for the Bible and Constitution.
They stand against communist revolution.
They say, "It's Pinkoes like you that freed the slaves."
And they're right.


#The Ballad of the Carpenter

Jesus was a working man and a hero you will hear, born in the town of Bethlehem at the turning of the year, at the turning of the year.
When Jesus was a little lad, streets rang with his name for he argued with the older men and put them all to shame.
He put them all to shame.
He became a wandering journeyman and he traveled far and wide and he noticed how wealth and poverty live always side by side, live always side by side.
So he said, "Come, all you working men, farmers and weavers, too.
If you would only stand as one, this world belongs to you.
This world belongs to you"
When the rich men heard what the carpenter had done, to the Roman troops they ran, saying put this rebel Jesus down.
He's a menace to God and man.
He's a menace to God and man.
The commander of the occupying troops just laughed and then he said, "There's a cross to spare on Calvaries hill.
By the weekend he'll be dead.
By the weekend he'll be dead."
Now, Jesus walked among the poor for the poor were his own kind and they'd never let them get near enough to take him from behind, to take him from behind.
So they hired one of the traders' trade and an informer was he and he sold his brother to the butcher's men for a fistful of silver money, for a fistful of silver money.
And Jesus sat in the prison cell and they beat him and offered him bribes to desert the cause of his fellow man and work for the rich men's tribe, to work for the rich men's tribe.
And the sweat stood out on Jesus's brow and the blood was in his eye when they nailed his body to the Roman cross and they laughed as they watched him die.
They laughed as they watched him die.
Two thousand years have passed and gone, many a hero, too, but the dream of this poor carpenter remains in the hands of you, remains in the hands of you.


#Days of Decision

Oh, the shadows of doubt are in many a mind, looking for an answer they're never going to find, but they'd better decide because they're running out of time for these are the days of decision.
Oh, the games of stalling you cannot afford.
Dark is the danger that's knocking on the door and the far-reaching rockets say you can't wait anymore for these are the days of decision.
In the face of the people who know they're going to win, there's a strength that's greater than the power of the wind and you can't stand around when the ice is growing thin for these are the days of decision.
I've seen your heads hiding beneath the blankets of fear when the paths they are plain and the choices are clear, but with each passing day, boys, the cost is more dear for these are the days of decision.
There's many a cross that burns in the night and the fingers of the fire are pointing as they bite.
Oh, you can't let the smoke keep on blinding all your sight for these are the days of decision.
Now, the mobs of anger are roaming the street.
From the rooftops they are aiming at the police on the beat.
And in city after city you know they will repeat for these are the days of decision.
There's been warnings of fire, warnings of flood.
Now there's the warning of the bullet and the blood from the three bodies buried in the Mississippi mud, saying these are the days of decision.
There's a change in the wind and a split in the road.
You can do what's right or you can do what you are told.
And the prize of the victory will belong to the bold.
Yes, these are the days of decision.


#Here's to the State of Mississippi

Here's to the state of Mississippi for underneath her borders, the devil draws no lines.
If you drag her muddy river, nameless bodies you will find.
Whoa, the fat trees of the forest have hid a thousand crimes.
The calender is lying when it reads the present time.
Whoa here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of!
Here's to the people of Mississippi, who say the folks up north, they just don't understand.
And they tremble in their shadows at the thunder of the Klan.
The sweating of their souls can't wash the blood from off their hands.
They smile and shrug their shoulders at the murder of a man.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
Here's to the schools of Mississippi, where they're teaching all the children that they don't have to care.
All of rudiments of hatred are present everywhere and every single classroom is a factory of despair.
There's nobody learning such a foreign word as fair.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
Here's to the cops of Mississippi.
They're chewing their tobacco as they lock the prison door.
Their bellies bounce inside them as they knock you to the floor.
No, they don't like taking prisoners in their private little war.
Behind their broken badges there are murderers and more.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
And here's to the judges of Mississippi, who wear the robe of honor as they crawl into the court.
They're guarding all the bastions with their phony legal fort.
Oh, justice is a stranger when the prisoners report.
when the black man stands accused, the trial is always short.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
And here's to the government of Mississippi.
In the swamp of their bureaucracy they're always bogging down and criminals are posing as the mayors of the towns.
They're hoping that no one sees the sights and hears the sounds.
And the speeches of the governor are the ravings of a clown.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
And here's to the laws of Mississippi.
Congressmen will gather in a circus of delay while the Constitution is drowning in an ocean of decay.
Unwed mothers should be sterilized, I've even heard them say.
Yes, corruption can be classic in the Mississippi way.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
And here's to the churches of Mississippi, where the cross, once made of silver, now is caked with rust and the Sunday morning sermons pander to their lust.
The fallen face of Jesus is choking in the dust.
Heaven only knows in which God they can trust.
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of.
Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of.
