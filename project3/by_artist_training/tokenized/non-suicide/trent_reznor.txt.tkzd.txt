wish

this is the first day of my last days .
i built it up , now i take it apart .
climbed up real high now fall down real far .
no need for me to stay .
the last thing left , i just threw it away .
i put my faith in god and my trust in you , now there 's nothing more fucked up i could do .
wish there was something real , wish there was something true .
wish there was something real in this world full of you .
i 'm the one without a soul .
i 'm the one with this big fucking hole .
no new tale to tell .
twenty-six years on my way to hell .
gotta listen to your big time , hard line , bad luck , fist fuck .
do n't think you 're having all the fun , you know me i hate everyone .
wish there was something real , wish there was something true .
wish there was something real in this world full of you .
i want to but i ca n't turn back , but i want to .


#last

gave up trying to figure out when my head got lost along the way .
worn out from giving it up , and my soul i pissed it all away .
still stings these shattered nerves , pigs we get what pigs deserve .
i 'm going all the way down i 'm leaving today .
come , come , come on you 've got to fill me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
come , come , come on , you 're got to fix me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
still feel it all slipping away , but it does n't matter anymore .
everybody 's still chipping away , but it does n't matter anymore .
look through these blackened eyes ; you 'll see ten thousand lies .
come , come , come on you 've got to fill me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
come , come , come on , you 're got to fix me up .
come , come , got to let me get through to you .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
i know it 's all getting away , and it comes to me as no surprise .
i know what 's coming to me , and is never going to arrive .
fresh blood through tired skin , new sweat to drown me in .
dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive .
come , come , come on you 've got to fill me up .
come , come , got to let me inside of you .
come , come , come on , you 're got to fix me up .
come , come , got to let me get through to you .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
this is n't meant to last .
this is for right now .
i wish i could put the blame on you .
i want you to make me , i want you to take me , i want you to break me , then i want you to throw me away .
i want you to make me , i want you to take me , i want you to break me , then i want you to throw me away .


#happiness in slavery

slave screams , he thinks he knows what he wants .
slave screams , thinks he has something to say .
slave screams , he hears but does n't want to listen .
slave screams , he 's being beat into submission .
do n't open your eyes , you wo n't like what you see .
the devils of truth steal the souls of the free .
do n't open your eyes , take it from me .
i have found , you can find , happiness is slavery .
slave screams , he spends his life learning conformity .
slave screams , he claims he has his own identity .
slave screams , he 's going to cause the system to fall .
slave screams but he 's glad to be chained to that wall .
do n't open your eyes , you wo n't like what you see .
the blind have been blessed with security .
do n't open your eyes , take it from me .
i have found , you can find , happiness is slavery .
i do n't know what i am .
i do n't know where i 've been .
human junk , just words and so much skin .
stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine .
just some flesh caught in this big , broken machine .


#gave up

perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most .
forgot how it feels well almost .
no one to blame always the same .
open my eyes .
wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up in flames .
it took you to make me realize .
it took you to make me realize .
it took you to make me realize .
it took you to make me see the light .
smashed up my sanity .
smashed up my integrity .
smashed up what i believed in .
smashed up what 's left of me .
smashed up my everything .
smashed up all that was true .
going to smash myself to pieces , i do n't know what else to do .
covered in hope and vaseline , still cannot fix this broken machine .
watching the hole it used to be mine .
just watching it burn in my steady , systematic decline of the trust i will betray .
give it to me i throw it away .
and after everything i 've done i hate myself for what i 've become .
i tried , i gave up .
i tried , i gave up .
i tried , i gave up .
i tried , and i gave up .
throw it away .


#physical (you're so )

i want to take you baby .
i want to take you out .
i want to wine and dine you .
oh , i want to twist , and twist and shout .
i want you hot in my arms .
so soft on my bed .
you get the key to my heart , oh , when you wear that sweet dress .
but you 're too physical , physical to me .
you 're just too physical , physical no to me .
i want your rough house baby .
i want this right in your ear .
you let me feel your danger .
i let you make this feeling clear here .
i want the touch of your charms , the heat of your breath .
i want to say all those things that would be better unsaid .
but you 're too physical , physical to me .
you 're just too physical , oh .
you 're too physical for me .
you 're too physical to me .
you 're really just just too just too really , fuck no!
you 're just too physical .
you 're just too physical .
too fucking physical .
no , no no no no no no .
oh you 're too physical .
just too physical .
just too .


#suck

there is no god up in the sky tonight .
no sign of heaven anywhere in sight .
all that was true is left behind .
once i could see now i am blind .
do n't want your dreams you try to sell .
this disease i give to myself .
how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
she makes it sweeter than the sun .
i get too tight i come undone .
i bow my head to confess .
the temple walls are made of flesh .
runs up my arms 'til i 'm on track .
itches my skin right off of my back .
i 'll heal your wounds .
i 'll set you free .
i 'm jesus christ on ecstasy .
how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
i am so dirty on on the inside .
i am so dirty on on the inside .
i am so dirty on on the inside .
i am so dirty on on the inside .
how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
suck , suck , suck , suck .
a thousand lips , a thousand tongues , a thousand throats , a thousand lungs , a thousand ways to make it true i want to do terrible things to you .

#head like a hole

#terrible lie

hey god , why are you doing this to me ?
hey god , am i not living up to what i 'm supposed to be ?
why am i seething with this animosity ?
hey god , i think you owe me a great big apology .
terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie .
hey god , i really do n't know what you mean .
hey god , seems like salvation comes only in our dreams .
hey god , i feel my hatred grow all the more extreme .
hey god , can this world really be as sad as it seems ?
terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie .
do n't take it away from me , i need someone to hold on to .
do n't take it away from me , i need someone to hold on to .
hey god , there 's nothing left for me to hide .
hey god , i lost my ignorance , security and pride .
hey god , i 'm all alone in a world you must despise .
hey god , i believed your promises , your promises and lies .
terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie .
you made me throw it all away , my morals left to decay .
how many you betray .
you 've taken everything
my head is filled with disease .
my skin is begging you please .
i 'm on my hands and knees
i want so much to believe .
i give you everything .
my sweet everything .


#down in it

kinda like a cloud , i was up , way up in the sky , and i was feeling some feelings you would n't believe .
sometimes i do n't believe them myself , and i decided i was never coming down .
just then a tiny little dot caught my eye .
it was just about too small to see , but i watched it way too long .
it was pulling me down .
i was up about it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it
i was up above it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it .
well shut up .
so what , what does it matter now ?
i was swimming in the haze now i crawl on the ground .
and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me .
try to laugh about it now , but is n't it funny how everything works out .
"i guess the joke 's on me , " she said .
i was up about it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it
i was up above it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it .
i used to be so big and strong .
i used to know my right from wrong .
i used to never be afraid .
i used to be somebody
i used to have something inside .
now just this hole that 's open wide .
i used to want it all .
i used to be somebody .
i 'll cross my heart and hope to die , but the needle 's already in my eye .
and all the world 's weight is on my back , and i do n't even know why .
and what i used to think was me is just a fading memory .
i looked him right in the eye and said goodbye .
was up about it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it
i was up above it .
i was up above it .
now i 'm down in it .


#sanctified

it 's still getting worse after everything i tried .
what if i found a way to wash it all aside ?
what if she touches with those fingertips as the words spill out like fire from her lips .
if she says come inside i 'll come inside for her .
if she says give it all , i 'll give everything to her .
i am justified .
i am purified .
i am sanctified .
inside you .
heaven 's just a rumor she 'll dispel as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell .
i still dream of lips i never should have never kissed .
well she knows exactly what i ca n't resist
if she says come inside i 'll come inside for her .
if she says give it all , i 'll give everything to her .
i am justified .
i am purified .
i am sanctified .
inside you .
i 'm just caught up in another of her spells .
while she 's turning me into someone else .
everyday i hope and pray this will end , but when i can i do it all again .
if she says come inside i 'll come inside for her .
if she says give it all , i 'll give everything to her .
i am justified .
i am purified .
i am sanctified .
inside you .
i am justified .
i am purified .
i am sanctified .
inside you .


#something i can never have

i still recall the taste of my tears .
echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears .
my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore .
scraping through my head 'till i do n't want to sleep anymore .
you make this all go away .
you make this all go away .
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm starting to scare myself .
you make this all go away .
you make it all go away .
i just want something .
i just want something i can never have .
you always were the one to show me how .
back then i could n't do the things that i can do now .
this thing is slowly take me apart .
grey would be the color if i had a heart .
come on , tell me .
you make this all go away .
you make this all go away .
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm starting to scare myself .
you make this all go away .
you make it all go away .
i just want something .
i just want something i can never have .
in this place it seems like such a same .
though it all looks different now , i know it 's still the same .
everywhere i look you 're all i see .
just a fading , fucking reminder of who i used to be .
you make this all go away .
you make this all go away .
i 'm down to just to thing , and i 'm starting to scare myself .
you make this all go away .
you make it all go away .
i just want something .
i just want something i can never have .
i just want something i can never have .


#kinda i want to

i ca n't shake this feeling from my head .
there 's a devil sleeping in my bed .
he 's watching you from across the way .
i cannot make this feeling go away .
i know it 's not the right thing , and i know it 's not the good thing but kinda i want to .
i 'm not sure of what i should do when everything i 'm think of is you .
all of my excuses turn to lies .
maybe god will cover up his eyes
i know it 's not the right thing , and i know it 's not the good thing but kinda i
want to .
and i want to , maybe just for tonight .
we can pretend it 's alright .
what 's the price i pay ?
i do n't care what they say .
i want to .
i want to .


#sin

you give me the reason .
you give me control .
i gave you my purity , and my purity you stole .
did you think i would n't recognize this compromise .
am i just too stupid to realize .
stale incense , old sweat and lies , lies , lies .
it comes down to this , your kiss , your fist .
and your strain , it get 's under my skin , within , take in , the extent of my sin .
you give me the anger .
you give me the nerve .
to carry out the sentence , while i get what i deserve .
i 'm just an effigy to be defaced , to be disgraced .
your need for me has been replaced .
and if i ca n't have everything well that just gives me a taste .
it comes down to this , your kiss , your fist .
and your strain , it get 's under my skin , within , take in , the extent of my sin .


#that 's what i get

just when everything was making sense , you took away all my self-confidence .
now all that i 've been hearing must be true .
i guess i 'm not the only boy for you .
but that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
how could you turn us into this , after you just taught me how to kiss you .
i told you i 'd never say goodbye .
now i 'm slipping on the tears you made me cry .
but 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
why does it come as a surprise to think that i was so naive .
maybe did n't mean so much .
but it meant everything to me .
but 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .


# the only time

i 'm drunk , and right now i 'm so in love with you .
and i do n't want to think too much about what we should or should n't do .
lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars , while the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car .
nothing quite like the feel of something new .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
this is the only time i really feel alive .
this is the only time i really feel alive .
i swear , i just found everything i need .
the sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me .
well i want to drink it up and swim in it until i drown , my immoral standing is lying down .
nothing quite like the feel of something new .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up .
maybe i 'm all messed up in you .
maybe i 'm all messed up .


#ringfinger

well you 've got me working so heard lately .
working my hands until they bleed .
if i was twice the man i could be .
i 'd still be half of what you need .
still you lead me and i follow .
anything you ask you know i 'll do .
but this one act of consecration is what i ask of you .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me .
well you just left me nailed here hanging like jesus on the cross .
i 'll be dying for your sins .
and aiding to the cause .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me .
wrap my eyes in bandages as confessions i see through .
i get everything i want when i get part of you .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , devil 's flesh and bone do something for me .

#heresy

he sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see .
he tries to tell me what i put inside of me .
he 's got the answers to ease my curiosity .
he dreamed up a god and called it christianity .
your god is dead , and no one cares .
if there is a hell i 'll see you there .
he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line .
he made a virus that would kill off all the swine .
his perfect kingdom of killing , suffering , and pain demands devotion atrocities done in his name .
your god is dead and no one cares .
if there is a hell , i 'll see you there .
your god is dead and no one cares .
if there is a hell , i 'll see you there .
god is dead .
god is dead .
god is dead .
god is dead .
god is dead .
your god is dead and no one cares .
if there is a hell , i 'll see you there .
your god is dead and no one cares .
drowning in his own hypocrisy .
and if there is a hell i will see you there .
burning with your god in humility .
will you die for this ?


#march of the pigs

step right up , march , push , crawl right up on your knees , please , greed , feed ( no time to hesitate ) .
i want a little bit .
i want a piece of it .
i think he 's losing it .
i want to watch it come down .
do n't like the look of it .
do n't like the taste of it .
do n't like the smell of it .
i want to watch it come down .
all the pigs are all lined up .
i give you all that you want .
take the skin and peel it back .
now does n't that make you feel better ?
shove it up inside , surprise !
lies .
stains like the blood on your teeth .
bite , chew , suck , away the tender parts .
i want to break it up .
i want to smash it up .
i want to fuck it up .
i want to watch it come down .
maybe afraid of it .
let 's discredit it .
let 's pick away at it .
i want to watch it come down .
all the pigs are all lined up .
i give you al that you want .
take the skin and peel it back .
now does n't that make you feel better ?
the pigs have won tonight .
now they can all sleep soundly .
and everything is all right .


#closer

you let me violate you .
you let me desecrate you .
you let me penetrate you .
you let me complicate you .
help me i broke apart my insides .
help me i�ve got no soul to sell .
help me the only thing that works for me , help me get away from myself .
i want to fuck you like an animal .
i want to feel you from the inside .
i want to fuck you like an animal .
my whole existence is flawed .
you get me closer to god .
you can have my isolation .
you can have the hate that it brings .
you can have my absence of faith .
you can have my everything .
help me tear down my reason .
help me it 's your sex i can smell .
help me you make me perfect .
help me become somebody else .
i want to fuck you like an animal .
i want to feel you from the inside .
i want to fuck you like an animal .
my whole existence is flawed .
you get me closer to god .
through every forest , above the trees , within my stomach , scraped off my knees .
i drink the honey inside your hive .
you are the reason i stay alive .


#ruiner

you had all of them on your side , did n't you ?
you believe in all your lies , did n't you ?
the ruiner 's got a lot to prove .
he 's got nothing to lose , and now he made you believe .
the ruiner 's your only friend .
well he 's the living end to the cattle he deceives .
the raping of the innocent ; you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees .
now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease .
how 'd you get so big ?
how 'd you get so strong ?
how 'd you get so hard ?
how 'd you get so long ?
you had to give them all a sign , did n't you ?
you had to covet what was mine , did n't you ?
the ruiner 's a collector .
he 's an infector , serving his shit to his flies .
maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize .
maybe it 's a part of me you took to a place i hoped it would never go .
and maybe that fucked me up so much more than you 'll ever know .
how 'd you get so big ?
how 'd you get so strong ?
how 'd you get so hard ?
how 'd you get so long ?
what you gave to me , my perfect ring of scars .
you know i can see what you really are .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop me now .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop me now .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop me now .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can hurt me .
you did n't hurt me .
nothing can stop .


# the becoming

i beat my machine .
it 's a part of me .
it 's inside of me
i 'm stuck in this dream .
it 's changing me .
i am becoming .
the me that you know had some second thoughts .
he 's covered with scabs and he is broken and sore .
the me that you know does n't come around much .
that part of me is n't here anymore .
all pain disappears .
it 's the nature of , of my circuitry .
drowns out all i hear .
there 's no escape from this , my new consciousness .
the me that you know used to have feelings , but the blood has stopped pumping , and he is left to decay .
the me that you know is now made up of wires .
and even when i 'm right with you , i 'm so far away .
i can try to get away , but i�ve strapped myself in .
i can try to scratch away the sound in my ears .
i can see it killing away all my bad parts .
i do n't want to listen but it 's all too clear .
hiding backwards inside of me i feel so unafraid .
annie , hold a little tighter i might just slip away .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .
it wo n't give up it wants me dead .
goddamn this noise inside my head .


#i do not want this

i 'm losing ground .
you know how this world can beat you down .
i 'm made of clay .
i fear i 'm the only one who thinks this way .
i 'm always falling down the same hill .
bamboo puncturing this skin and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall i 'm drowning in .
two feet below the surface i can still make out your wavy face .
if i could just reach you maybe i could leave this place .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
you do n't know just how i feel .
i stay inside my bed .
i have lived so many lives all in my head .
do n't tell me that you care .
there really is n't anything now , is there ?
you would know , would n't you ?
you extend your hand to those who suffer , to those who know what it really feels like , to those who 've had a taste like that means something .
and oh so sick i am .
and maybe i do n't have a choice .
and maybe that is all i have .
and maybe this is a cry for help .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
i do not want this .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
do n't you tell me how i feel .
you do n't know just how i feel .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .
i want to know everything .
i want to be everywhere .
i want to fuck everyone in the world .
i want to do something that matters .

#eraser

need you .
dream you .
find you .
taste you .
fuck you .
use you .
scar you .
break you .
lose me .
hate me .
smash me .
erase me .
kill me .
kill me .
kill me .
kill me .
kill me .
kill me .
kill me .
kill me .


#reptile

she spread herself wide open to let the insects in .
she leaves a trail of honey to show me where she 's been .
she has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin .
seeds from a thousand others drip down from within .
oh , my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
devils speak of the ways in which she 'll manifest .
angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress .
need to contaminate , to alleviate this loneliness .
i now know the depths i reach are limitless .
oh my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
oh , oh , my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
oh , my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .


# the downward spiral

he could n't believe how easy it was .
he put the gun into his face .
bang !
so much blood from such a tiny little hole .
problems do have solutions , you know .
a lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash .
everything 's blue .
everything 's blue in this world .
the deepest shade of mushroom blue .
all fuzzy , spilling out of my head .


#hurt

i hurt myself today to see if i still feel .
i focus on the pain , the only thing that 's real .
the needle tears a hole , the old familiar sting .
try to kill it all away , but i remember everything .
what have i become , my sweetest friend ?
everyone i know goes away in the end .
you could have it all , my empire of dirt .
i will let you down .
i will make you hurt .
i wear this crown of shit upon my liar 's chair .
full of broken thoughts i cannot repair .
beneath the stain of time , the feeling disappears .
you are someone else .
i am still right here .
what have i become , my sweetest friend ?
everyone i know goes away in the end .
you could have it all my empire of dirt .
i will let you down .
i will make you hurt .
if i could start again a million miles away , i would keep myself .
i would find a way .


#burn

this world rejects me .
this world threw me away .
this world never gave me a chance .
this world going to have to pay .
well i do n't believe in your institutions .
i did what you wanted me to .
and like the cancer in your system .
i 've got a little surprise for you .
something inside of me has opened up its eyes .
why did you put it there ?
did you not realise ?
this thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound .
sometimes i think i could .
burn .
burn .
i look down there where you 're standing .
flock of sheep all on display .
with all your lies piled up around you .
i can take it all away .
something inside of me has opened up its eyes .
why did you put it there ?
did you not realise ?
this thing inside of me it screams the loudest sound .
sometimes i think i could .
i 'm going to burn this whole world down .
i 'm going to burn this whole world down .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i never was a part of you
burn .
i am your savior .
i am corruption .
i am the angel of your destruction .
i am perversion , secret desire .
i am your future swallowed up in fire .


#dead souls

someone take these dreams away that point me to another day .
a duel of personalities that stretch all true reality .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
when figures from the past stand tall , and mocking voices ring the hall .
imperialistic house of prayer .
conquistadors who took their share .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
calling me , calling me , calling me , calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .

#beginning of the end

down on your knees you 'll be left behind .
this is the beginning .
watch what you think they can read your mind .
this is the beginning .
i got my mark ; see it in my eyes .
this is the beginning .
my reflection i do n't recognize .
this is the beginning .
we think we climb so high all up the backs we 've condemned .
we face our consequence .
this is the beginning of the end .
you wait your turn , you 'll be last in line .
this is the beginning .
get out the way cause i 'm getting mine .
this is the beginning .
god helps the ones that help themselves .
this is the beginning .
may be too late as far as i can tell .
this is the beginning .
we think we 've come so far .
on all our lies we depend .
we face our consequence .
this is the beginning of the end .


#survivalism

i should have listened to her .
so hard to keep control .
we kept on eating but our bloated belly 's still not full .
she gave us all she had , but we went and took some more .
ca n't seem to shut her legs .
our mother nature is a whore .
i got my propaganda .
i got revisionism .
i got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism .
all a part of this great nation .
i got my fist .
i got my plan .
i got survivalism .
hypnotic sound of sirens echoing through the street .
the cocking of the rifles , the marching of the feet .
you see your world on fire .
do n't try to act surprised .
we did just what you told us .
lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies .
i got my propaganda .
i got revisionism .
i got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism .
all a part of this great nation .
i got my fist .
i got my plan .
i got survivalism .
all bruised and broken , bleeding , she asked to take my hand .
i turned , just keep on walking , but you 'd do the same thing in the circumstance .
i 'm sure you 'll understand .
i got my propaganda .
i got revisionism .
i got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism .
all a part of this great nation .
i got my fist .
i got my plan .
i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
i got survivalism .


# the good soldier

gun fire in the street where we used to meet echos out a beat , and the bass goes ...
bomb , right over my head , step over the dead .
remember what you said , you know , the part about life is just a waking dream , well i know what you mean , but that be not how it seems right here right now .
how can all this be real ?
i can barely feel anymore .
i am trying to see .
i am trying to believe .
this is not where i should be .
i am trying to believe .
blood hardens in the sand .
cold metal in my hand may help you understand the way that things are going to be .
there 's nowhere else to hide cause god is on our side , i keep telling myself .
i am trying to see .
i am trying to believe .
this is not where i should be .
i am trying to believe .


#vessel

i let you put it in my mouth .
i let it get under my skin .
i let you pump it through my veins .
i let you take me from within .
they tell you what we can and cannot do .
same thing we 've heard a hundred times before .
when i put you inside of me , none of that matters anymore .
my god , can i go any faster ?
oh my god , i do n't think i can last here .
i am you , and you are me .
we will never be alone .
i have finally found my place in everything .
i have finally found my home .
i can leave all of this flesh behind .
i can see right through this whole facade .
i am becoming something else .
i am turning into god .
my god can i go any faster ?
oh my god , i do n't think i can last here .


#me , i 'm not

well it 's happening .
never planned on this .
you 've got something i need , kind of dangerous .
and i 'm losing control .
i 'm not used to this .
what you want from me .
i 'm not used to this .
i ca n't shut it off this thing i 've begun .
and it 's hard to tell just where it 's coming from .
and it 's hard to see what i 'm capable of .
and it 's hard to believe just what i 've become .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not
i can swallow it down , keep it all inside .
i define myself by how well i hide .
i feel it coming apart .
well , at least i tried .
i can win this war by knowing not to fight .
if i take it all back , someway , somehow .
if i knew back then what i know right now .
hey can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not .
hey , can we stop...
me , i 'm not .


#capital g

i pushed a button and elected him to office , and he pushed a button and it dropped a bomb .
you pushed the button and could watch it on the television .
those motherfuckers did n't last too long , ha ha .
i 'm sick of hearing about the haves and the have-nots .
have some personal accountability .
the biggest problem with the way that we 've been doing things is the more we let you have , the less that i 'll be keeping for me .
well i used to stand for something , now i 'm on my hands and knees .
traded in my god for this one , and he signs his name with a capital g .
do n't give a shit about the temperature in guatemala .
do n't really see what all the fuss is about .
aing . going to worry 'bout no future generations , and i 'm sure somebody going to figure it out .
do n't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person , you have n't had enough to know what it 's like .
you 're only angry cause you wish you were in my position .
now nod your head because you know that i 'm right , alright !
well i used to stand for something , but forgot what that could be .
there 's a lot of me inside you .
maybe you 're afraid to see .
well i used to stand for something , now i 'm on my hands and knees .
traded in my god for this one , and he signs his name with a capital g .


#my violent heart

you and i , we may look the same , but we are very far apart .`
there 's bullet holes where my compassion used to be , and there is violence in my heart .
into fire you can send us .
from the fire we return .
you can label us a consequence of how much you have to learn .
you can try but , you 'll never understand .
this is something you will never understand .
can you hear it now ?
hear it coming now .
can you hear it now ?
on hands and knees , we crawl .
you can not stop us all .
our bones , our skin .
we will not let you in .
you have set something in motion , now .
much greater than you 've ever known .
standing there in all your grand naivety , about to reap what you have sown .
time will feed upon your weaknesses , and soon you 'll lose the will to care .
when you return to the place that you call home , we will be there .
we will be there .
on hands and knees , we crawl .
you can not stop us all .
our blood will stain .
we will not go away .
on hands and knees , we crawl .
you can not stop us all .
our blood , our ways will never leave this place .


# the warning

some say it was a warning .
some say it 's a sign .
i was standing right there when it came down from the sky .
the way it spoke to us , you felt it from inside .
said it was up to us , up to us to decide .
"you 've become a virus , killing off his host .
we been watching you with all our eyes and what you seem to value most .
so much potential , or so we used to say .
your greed , self-importance , and your arrogance , you piss it all away .
we heard her cry .
we have come to intervene .
you will change your ways and you will make amends , or we will wipe this place clean ! "
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away .
your time is tick , tick , ticking away , ticking away .


#god given

hey man , please do n't make a sound .
take a look around .
ca n't you see what 's right in front of you ?
ah , have a little taste .
no more time to waste .
you do n't want to get left behind cause it 's all coming down right now .
how hard is it to see ?
put your faith in me .
i sure would n't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood .
you should get where you belong .
everything you know is wrong .
come on , sing along , everybody now .
god given !
and he gives us sight , and we see the light , and it burns so bright .
now we know we 're right .
when his kingdom come , and thy will be done , we have just begun .
we 're the chosen ones .
i would never tell you anything that was n't absolutely true that had n't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you .
wait , step into the light .
how can this be right ?
i 'm afraid we 're going to ask you to leave .
guess you can not win , with the color of your skin .
you wo n't be getting in to the promised land .
besides this is just another case , you people still do n't know your place .
step aside , out the way , wipe that look off your face .
we are the devine .
separated from the swine .
come on , sing along , everybody now .
god given !
and he gives us sight , and we see the light , and it burns so bright .
now we know we 're right .
when his kingdom come , and thy will be done , we have just begun .
we 're the chosen ones .
and he gives us sight .
and we see the light .
and it burns so bright .
now we know we 're right .
when his kingdom come , and thy will be done , and the father and the holy son , we 're the chosen ones .
i would never tell you anything that was n't absolutely true that had n't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you .


#meet your master

bow down in position against the polished steel .
this is something different .
you 'll like this way this feels .
no time for asking questions .
no time for wondering .
we 've heard enough from you now .
we 've heard everything .
we 're going to play a new game .
you 'll put on this blindfold .
you 'll do what we tell you .
you 'll do as your told .
used to be the leader .
now comes the time to serve .
maybe we show some mercy .
maybe you get what you deserve .
count down to the end , got to make it come faster , faster .
right around the bend is a coming disaster .
count down to the end , and we 're headed there faster .
come on down , my friend .
it 's time to meet your master .
you 've left quite a mess here under your stewardship .
you thought you 'd figured it out , but you 'll learn your place in this .
might take some convincing for you to see the truth .
there are so many things that we 've got in store for you .
count down to the end , got to make it come faster , faster .
right around the bend , is a coming disaster .
count down to the end , and we 're headed there faster , faster .
come on down , my friend .
it 's time to meet your master .


# the greater good

breathe us in .
slowly , slowly .
persuasion .
coercion .
submission .
assimilation .
welcome to your new point of view .
we have disappeared into you .
everything you do , everywhere you go , anything you want , anything .
everything you do , everywhere you go , anything you want , anything .
everything you do , everywhere you go , anything you want , anything .
everything you do , everywhere you go , anything you want , anything .
breathe us in .
slowly , slowly .
breathe us in .
slowly , slowly .
now it 's all just a matter of time .


# the great destroyer

say your name , try to speak as clearly as you can .
you know , everything gets written down .
nod your head , just in case they could be watching with their shiny satellites .
i hope they cannot see the limitless potential living inside of me to murder everything .
i hope they cannot see , i am the great destroyer .
turn it up , listen to the shit they pump into your head , filling you with apathy .
hold your breath .
wait until you know the time is right .
on time , the end is near .
i hope they cannot see the limitless potential living inside of me .
i murder everything .
i hope they cannot see , i am the great destroyer .


#in this twilight

watch the sun , as it crawls across a final time .
and it feels like , like it was a friend .
it is watching us , and the world we set on fire .
do you wonder if it feels the same ?
and the sky is filled with light .
can you see it ?
all the black is really white , if you believe it .
as your time is running out , let me take away your doubt .
you can find a better a place in this twilight .
from dust to dust , ashes in your hair remind me what it feels like and i wo n't feel again .
night descends .
could i have been a better person ?
if i could only do it all again .
and the sky is filled with light .
do you see it ?
all the black is really white , if you believe it .
and the longing that you feel .
you know none of this is real .
you will find a better a place in this twilight .


#zero-sum

they 're starting to open up the sky .
they 're starting to reach down through .
and it feels like we 're living in that split-second of a car crash .
and time is slowing down .
and if we only had a little more time .
and this time is all there is .
do you remember the time we ...
and all the times we ...
and should have ...
and were going to...
i know , and i know you remember how we could justify it all , and we knew better .
in our hearts we knew better .
and we told ourselves it did n't matter , and we chose to continue , and none of this matters anymore in the hour of our twilight .
and soon it will be all said and done .
and we will all be back together as one .
if we will continue at all .
shame on us , doomed from the start .
may god have mercy on our dirty little hearts .
shame on us for all we 've done , and all we ever were , just zeros and ones .
and you never get away .
and you never get to take the easy way .
and all of this is a consequence brought on by our own hand , if you believe in that sort of thing .
and did you ever really find , when you closed your eyes , any place that was still and at peace ?
and i guess i just wanted to tell you , as the light starts to fade , that you are the reason that i am not afraid .
and i guess i just wanted to mention , as the heavens will fall , we will be together soon if we will be anything at all .
shame on us , doomed from the start .
may god have mercy on our dirty little hearts .
shame on us for all we 've done , and all we ever were , just zeros and ones .
