extraordinary machine

i certainly have n't been shopping for any new shoes , and i certainly have n't been spreading myself around .
i still only travel by foot , and by foot it 's a slow climb , but i 'm good at being uncomfortable , so i ca n't stop changing all the time .
i notice that my opponent is always on the go , and wo n't go slow , so 's not to focus , and i notice he 'll hitch a ride with any guide , as long as they go fast from whence he came , but he 's no good at being uncomfortable , so he ca n't stop staying exactly the same .
if there was a better way to go then it would find me .
i ca n't help it , the road just rolls out behind me .
be kind to me , or treat me mean .
i 'll make the most of it , i 'm an extraordinary machine .
i seem to you to seek a new disaster every day .
you deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay .
i mean to prove , i mean to move in my own way , and say i 've been getting along for long before you came into the play .
i am the baby of the family , it happens , so everybody cares and wears the sheeps ' clothes while they chaperone .
curious , you looking down your nose at me , while you appease courteous , to try and help , but let me set your mind at ease .
if there was a better way to go then it would find me .
i ca n't help it , the road just rolls out behind me .
be kind to me , or treat me mean .
i 'll make the most of it , i 'm an extraordinary machine .
do i so worry you , you need to hurry to my side ?
it 's very kind , but it 's to no avail ; i do n't want the bail .
i promise you , everything will be just fine .
if there was a better way to go then it would find me .
i ca n't help it , the road just rolls out behind me .
be kind to me , or treat me mean .
i 'll make the most of it , i 'm an extraordinary machine .

#get him back

one man , he disappoint me .
he give me the gouge and he take my glee .
now every other man i see remind me of the one man who disappoint me .
but wait till i get him back .
he wo n't have a back to scratch .
yeah , keep turning that chin and you will see my face as i figure how to kill what i cannot catch .
so i say , and on i go to another one to disappoint me so .
next one up , a contemptible snob .
he live to put things in their place .
he did a commendable job .
he put himself so low , he can hardly even look me in the face .
o , he made my blood just burn .
i flipped so far , i thought that i would not return .
but the last one i had who was getting my hopes up , i might 've been a little fast to dismiss .
i think he let me down , when he did n't disappoint me .
he did n't always guess right , but he usually got my gist .
so wait till i get him back .
i 'm going to bring him home , and i 'll watch him unpack .
yeah keep turning that chin , and you will see my face is fixed on the one i 'm going to get back .
i 'm going to get him back , i am .
i 'm going to get him back , i really am .

#o ' sailor

i 'm undecided about you again .
might n't be right that you 're not here .
it 's double-sided , cause i ruined it all , but also saved myself , by never believing you , dear .
everything good , i deem too good to be true .
everything else is just a bore .
everything i have to look forward to has a pretty painful and very imposing before .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
i have too been playing with fifty-two cards .
just cause i play so far from my vest .
whatever i 've got , i 've got no reason to guard .
what could i do , but spend my best ?
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
and after waiting , fighting patiently on my knees .
all the other stuff tired itself out first , not me .
and in its wake , appeared the touch and call of a different breed , one who set to get me wise , and got me there , and then got me .
and what a thing , to know what could be instead .
oh , what a blessed curse to see .
it took the agenda from its place in my bed , made a merry paramour of me .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
saying there 's nothing to it , and then letting it go by the boards .
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ?
what 'd you do that for ?
giving me eyes to view it , as it goes by the boards .

#better version of me

the nickel dropped when i was on my way beyond the rubicon .
what did i do ?
and of the games that i can handle , none are ones worth the candle .
what should i do ?
i 'm a frightened , fickle person fighting , crying , kicking , cursing .
what should i do ?
oooh , after all the folderol , and hauling over coals stops , what will i do ?
ca n't take a good day without a bad one .
do n't feel just to smile until i 've had one .
where did i learn ?
i make a fuss about a little thing .
the rhyme is losing to the riddling .
where 's the turn ?
i do n't want a home ; i 'd ruin that .
home is where my habits have a habitat .
why give it a turn ?
oh , after all the folderol , and hauling over coals stops what did i learn ?
i am likely to miss the main eventif i stop to cry or complain again , so i will keep a deliberate pace , let the damned breeze dry my face .
oh , mister , wait until you see what i 'm going to be .
i 've got a plan , a demand , and it just began , and if you 're right , you 'll agree .
here 's coming a better version of me .
here it comes a better version of me .
here it comes a better version of me .

#tymps ( the sick in the head song )

those boon times wentbust .
my feet of clay , they dried to dust .
the red is n't the red we painted ; it 's just rust .
and the signature thing that used to bring a following , i have trouble now even remembering .
so why did i kiss him so hard late last friday night , and keep on letting him change all my plans ?
i 'm either so sick in the head i need to be bled dry to quit , or i just really used to love him .
i sure hope thats it .
i knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch .
cause it is n't the rush of remembering , its just mush .
and the signature thing is only growing harrowing .
i should have no trouble now to keep from following .
so why did i kiss him so hard late last friday night , and keep on letting him change all my plans ?
i 'm either so sick in the head i need to be bled dry to quit , or i just really used to love him .
i sure hope thats it .

#parting gift

i opened my eyes while you were kissing me once , more than once , and you looked as sincere as a dog .
just as sincere as a dog does , when it 's the food on your lips with which it 's in love .
i bet you could never tell that i knew you did n't know me that well .
it is my fault , you see , you never learned that much from me .
oh you silly , stupid pastime of mine , you were always good for a rhyme , and from the first to the last time , the signs said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
it said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
i took off my glasses while you were yelling at me once , more than once , so 's not to see you see me react .
should 've put 'em , should 've put 'em on again , so i could see you see me sincerely yelling back .
i bet your fortressed face belied your fort of lace .
it is by the grace of me you never learned what i could see .
oh you silly , stupid pastime of mine , you were always good for a rhyme , and from the first to all the last times , all the signs said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
it said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .

#window

i was staring out the window the whole time he was talking to me .
it was a filthy pane of glass .
i could n't get a clear view .
and as he wenton and on , it was n't the outside world i could see .
just the filthy pane that i was looking through .
so i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
better that i break the window than him or her or me .
i was never focused on just one thing .
my eyes got fixed when my mind got soft .
it may look like i 'm concentrated on a very clear view , but i 'm as good as asleep.
i bet you did n't know .
it takes a lot of it away , if you do .
i had to break the windo .
it just had to be .
better that i break the window than him or her or me .
i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
it was in my way .
better that i break the window than forget what i had to say , or miss what i should see .
because the fact being that whatever 's in frontof me is covering my view .
so i ca n't see what i 'm seeing , in fact .
i only see what i 'm looking through .
so again i done the right thing .
i was never worried about that .
the answer 's always been in clear view .
but even when the window was cleaned , i still ca n't see for the fact that when it 's clean it 's so clear , i ca n't tell what i 'm looking through .
so i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
it was in my way .
better that i break the window than him or her or me .
i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
better that i break the window than miss what i should see .
i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
it was in my way .
better that i break the window than forget what i had to say , or miss what i should see , or break him her or me .
especially me .

#oh well

what you did to me made me see myself something different .
though i try to talk sense to myself , but i just wo n't listen .
wo n't you go away , turn yourself in .
you 're no good at confession .
before the image that you burned me in tries to teach you a lesson .
what you did to me made me see myself something awful .
a voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled .
it took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it .
i spent all i had to get it back , and now it seems i 've been outbidded .
my peace and quiet was stolen from me .
when i was looking with calm affection , you were searching out my imperfections .
what wasted unconditional love on somebody who does n't believe in the stuff .
you came upon me like a hypnic jerk when i was just about settled .
and when it counts you recoil with a cryptic word and leave a love belittled .
oh what a cold and common old way to go .
i was feeding on the need for you to know me ; devastated at the rate you fell below me .
what wasted unconditional love on somebody who does n't believe in the stuff .
oh , well .

#please please please

please , please , please , no more melodies .
they lack impact ; they 're petty .
they 've been made up already .
please , please , please , no more maladies .
i 'm so tired of crying ; you 'd think i was a siren .
but me and everybody 's on the sad same team and you can hear our sad brain screaming : give us something familiar , something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady , steady , steady going nowhere .
please , please , please , no apologies .
at best they buy you time till you next step out of line .
please , please , please , no more remedies .
my method is uncertain ; it 's a mess but it 's working .
and maybe if you tried it out , you wo n't like it when you 're crying out : give us something familiar something similar to what we know already that will keep us steady , steady , steady , steady going nowhere .

#red red red

i do n't understand about complementary colors and what they say .
side by side they both get bright .
together they both get gray .
but he 's been pretty much yellow , and i 've been kinda blue , but all i can see is red , red , red , red , red now .
what am i going to do ?
i do n't understand about diamonds and why men buy them .
what 's so impressive about a diamond except the mining ?
and it 's dangerous work trying to get to you too .
and i think if i did n't have to kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill myself doing it maybe i would n't think so much of you .
i 've been watching all the time , and i still ca n't find the tack .
and i want to know : is it okay ?
is it just fine ?
or is it my fault ?
is it my lack ?
i do n't understand about the weather outside , or the harmony in a tune , or why somebody lied .
there 's solace a bit for submitting to the fitfully cryptically true .
what 's happened has happened .
what 's coming is already on its way with a role for me to play .
i do n't understand .
i 'll never understand , but i 'll try to understand .
there 's nothing else i can do .

# not about love

the early cars already are drawing deep breaths past my door , and last night 's phrases sick with lack of basis are still writhing on my floor .
and it does n't seem fair that your wicked words should work in holding me down .
no , it does n't seem right to take information given at close range for the gag , and the bind and the ammunition round .
conversation once colored by esteem became duologue as a diagram of a play for blood
took a vacation , my palate got clean .
now i could taste your agenda while you 're spitting your cud .
and it does n't make sense i should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown .
no , it does n't seem right
to take information given at close range for the gag , and the bind , and the ammunition round .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
i miss that stupid ache .
what is this posture i have to stare at .
that 's what he said when i 'm sitting up straight .
change the name of the game because he lost , and he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late .
but i 'm not being fair , because i chose to listen to that filthy mouth , but i 'd like to choose right .
take all the things that i 've said that he stole , put 'em in a sack , swing 'em over my shoulder , turn on my heels , step out of this sight .
try to live in a lovelier light .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
this is not about love .
because i am not in love .
in fact i ca n't stop falling out .
i miss that stupid ache .

#waltz ( better than fine )

if you do n't have a song to sing , you 're okay .
you know how to get along humming , hmmm .
if you do n't have a date , celebrate .
go out and sit on the lawn and do nothing .
because it 's just what you must do .
nobody does it anymore .
no i do n't believe in the wasting of time , but i do n't believe that i 'm wasting mine .
if you do n't have a point to make , do n't sweat it .
you 'll make a sharp one being so kind .
and i 'd sure appreciate it .
everyone else 's goal 's to get big headed .
why should i follow that beat being that i 'm better than fine ?

#sleep to dream

i tell you how i feel , but you do n't care .
i say tell me the truth , but you do n't dare .
you say love is a hell you cannot bear , and i say gimme mine back and then go there for all i care .
i got my feet on the ground , and i do n't go to sleep to dream .
you got your head in the clouds , and you 're not at all what you seem .
this mind , this body , and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways , so do n't forget what i told you : do n't come around i got my own hell to raise .
i have never been so insulted in all my life .
i could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride .
first you run like a fool just to be at my side , and now you run like a fool , but you just run to hide , and i ca n't abide .
i got my feet on the ground , and i do n't go to sleep to dream .
you got your head in the clouds , and you 're not at all what you seem .
this mind , this body , and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways , so do n't forget what i told you : do n't come around i got my own hell to raise .
do n't make it a big deal .
do n't be so sensitive .
we 're not playing a game anymore .
you do n't have to be so defensive .
do n't you plead me your case .
do n't bother to explain .
do n't even show me your face because it 's a crying shame .
just go back to the rock from under which you came .
take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim , and do n't forget the blame .
i got my feet on the ground , and i do n't go to sleep to dream .
you got your head in the clouds , and you 're not at all what you seem .
this mind , this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways , so do n't forget what i told you : do n't come around i got my own hell to raise .

#sullen girl

days like this i do n't know what to do with myself all day and all night .
i wander the halls along the walls and under my breath i say to myself i need fuel to take flight .
and there 's too much going on , but it 's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion , under the waves in the blue of my oblivion .
is that why they call me a sullen girl , sullen girl .
they do n't know i used to sail the deep and tranquil sea .
but he washed me ashore , and he took my pearl and left an empty shell of me .
and there 's too much going on , but it 's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion , under the waves in the blue of my oblivion , under the waves in the blue of my oblivion .
it 's calm under the waves , in the blue of my oblivion .

#shadowboxer

once my lover , now my friend .
what a cruel thing to pretend .
what a cunning way to condescend .
once my lover , and now my friend .
oh , you creep up like the clouds and you set my soul at ease .
then you let your love abound and you bring me to my knees .
oh , it 's evil , babe , the way you let your grace enrapture me .
when will you know i 'd be insane to ever let that dirty game recapture me .
you made me a shadowboxer , baby .
i want to be ready for what you do .
i 've been swinging all around me because i do n't know when you 're going to make your move .
oh , your gaze is dangerous , and you fill your space so sweet .
if i let you get too close you 'll set your spell on me .
so darling i just want to say , just in case i do n't come through , i was on to every play .
i just wanted you .
but , oh , it 's so evil , my love , the way you 've no reverence to my concern .
so i 'll be sure to stay wary of you , love , to save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn .
you made me a shadowboxer , baby .
i want to be ready for what you do .
i 've been swinging all around me because i do n't know when you 're going to make your move .

#criminal

i 've been a bad , bad girl .
i 've been careless with a delicate man .
and it 's a sad , sad world when a girl will break a boy just because she can .
do n't you tell me to deny it .
i 've done wrong and i want to suffer for my sins .
i 've come to you because i need guidance to be true and i just do n't know where i can begin .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
heaven help me for the way i am .
save me from these evil deeds before i get them done .
i know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand .
but i keep living this day like the next will never come .
oh help me but do n't tell me to deny it .
i 've got to cleanse myself of all these lies till i 'm good enough for him .
i 've got a lot to lose , and i 'm betting high , so i 'm begging you before it ends just tell me where to begin .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
let me know the way before there 's hell to pay .
give me room to lay the law and let me go .
i 've got to make a play to make my lover stay .
so what would an angel say ?
the devil wants to know .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .
what i need is a good defense because i 'm feeling like a criminal , and i need to be redeemed to the one i 've sinned against because he 's all i ever knew of love .

#slow like honey

you moved like honey in my dream last night .
yeah , some old fires were burning .
you came near to me and you endeared to me , but you could n't quit discern me .
does that scare you ?
i 'll let you run away , but your heart will not oblige you .
you 'll remember me like a melody .
yeah , i 'll haunt the world inside you .
and my big secret : going to win you over , slow like honey , heavy with mood .
i 'll let you see me .
i 'll covet your regard .
i 'll invade your demeanor , and you 'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze .
and you 'll wonder what it is about me .
it 's my big secre : keeping you coming , slow like honey , heavy with mood .
though dreams can be deceiving , like faces are to hearts , they serve for sweet relieving when fantasy and reality lie too far apart .
so i stretch myself across like a bridge , and i pull you to the edge and stand there waiting , trying to attain the end to satisfy the story .
shall i release you ?
must i release you as i rise to meet my glory ?
but my big secret , going to hover over your life , going to keep you reaching , when i 'm gone like yesterday , when i 'm high like heaven , when i 'm strong like music , because i 'm slow like honey , and heavy with mood .

# the first taste

i lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts waiting for the black to replace my blue .
i do not struggle in your web because it was my aim to get caught .
but daddy longlegs , i feel that i 'm finally growing weary of waiting to be consumed by you .
give me the first taste .
let it begin .
heaven cannot wait forever .
darling , just start the chase .
i 'll let you win , but you must make the endeavour .
oh , your love gives me a heart confusion .
adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red .
your hungry flirt borders intrusion .
i 'm building memories on things we have not said .
full is not heavy as empty , not nearly my love , not nearly my love , not nearly .
give me the first taste .
let it begin .
heaven cannot wait forever .
darling , just start the chase .
i 'll let you win , but you must make the endeavour .

#never is a promise

you 'll never see the courage i know .
its colors ' richness wo n't appear within your view .
i 'll never glow the way that you glow .
your presence dominates the judgements made on you , but as the scenery grows , i see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception .
my feelings swell and stretch .
i see from greater heights .
i understand what i am still too proud to mention to you .
you 'll say you understand , but you do n't understand .
you 'll say you 'd never give up seeing eye to eye , but never is a promise and you ca n't afford to lie .
you 'll never touch these things that i hold .
the skin of my emotions lies beneath my own .
you 'll never feel the heat of this soul .
my fever burns me deeper than i 've ever shown to you .
you 'll say : do n't fear your dreams .
it 's easier than it seems .
you 'll say you 'd never let me fall from hopes so high , but never is a promise and you ca n't afford to lie .
you 'll never live the life that i live .
i 'll never live the life that wakes me in the night .
you 'll never hear the message i give .
you 'll say it looks as though i might give up this fight , but as the scenery grows , i see in different lights the shades and shadows undulate in my perception .
my feelings swell and stretch .
i see from greater heights .
i realise what i am now too smart to mention to you .
you 'll say you understand .
you 'll never understand .
i 'll say i 'll never wake up knowing how or why .
i do n't know what to believe in .
you wo n't know who i am .
you 'll say i need appeasing when i start to cry , but never is a promise and i 'll never need a lie .

# the child is gone

darling , give me your absence tonight .
take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white .
let me sink in the silence that echoes inside , and do n't bother leaving the light on because i suddenly feel like a different person .
from the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion , and i ran my hand o 'er a strange inversion , a vacancy that just did not belong .
the child is gone .
honey help me out of this mess .
i 'm a stranger to myself but do n't reach for me .
i 'm too far away .
i do n't want to talk because there 's nothing left to say .
so my darling , give me your absence tonight .
take all of your sympathy and leave it outside because there 's no kind of loving that can make this all right .
i 'm trying to find a place i belong , and i suddenly feel like a different person .
from the roots of my soul come a gentle coersion , and i ran my hand o 'er a strange inversion .
as the darkness turns into the dawn , the child is gone , the child is gone .

#pale september

pale september .
i wore the time like a dress that year .
the autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin .
but as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappearred , my heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within .
but then he rose , brilliant as the moon in full , and sank in the burrows of my keep.
and all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet .
and my winter giving way to warm as i 'm singing him to sleep.
he goes along just as a water lily , gentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floats unweighed down by passion or intensity , yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts .
and he finds a home in me for what misfortune sows he knows my touch will reap .
and all my armour falling down in a pile at me feet .
and my winter giving way to warm as i 'm singing him to sleep.
all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet .
and my winter giving way to warm as i 'm singing him to sleep.

#carrion

wo n't do no good to hold no seance .
what 's gone is gone , and you ca n't bring it back around .
wo n't do no good to hold no searchlight .
you ca n't illuminate what time has anchored down .
oh , honey , i 've gone away .
oh , honey , i 've gone away .
oh , honey , i 've gone away .
wo n't do no good to sing no love song .
no sound could simulate the presence of a man .
wo n't do no good asking no questions .
your divination should acquaint you with the plan .
oh , honey i 've gone away .
honey , i 've gone away .
honey , i 've gone away .
my feel for you , boy , is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered pery .
and all i want is to save you , honey , or the strength to walk away .
wo n't do no good to go no distance .
the space between us is as boundless as the dark .
wo n't do no good to throw no fists , babe .
you ca n't intimidate me back into your arms .
because honey , i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
my feel for you , boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey .
and all i want is to save you , honey or the strength to walk away .
my feel for you , boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey .
and all i want is to save you , honey or the strength to walk away .

#on the bound

all my life is on me now .
hail the pages turning .
and the future is on the bound .
hell do n't know my fury .
you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need youre all i need - and maybe some faith would do me good .
i do n't know what i 'm doing .
do n't know , should i change my mind ?
i ca n't decide .
there 's too many variations to consider .
no thing i do do n't do no thing but bring me more to do .
it 's true , i do imbue my blue unto myself .
i make it bitter .
baby , lay your head on my lap one more time .
tell me you belong to me .
baby say that it 's all going to be alright .
i believe that it is n't .
you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need youre all i need - and maybe some faith would do me good , and maybe some faith would do me good , and maybe some faith would do me good .

# to your love

here 's another speech you wish i 'd swallow .
another cue for you to fold your ears .
another train of thought too hard to follow , chugging along to the song that belongs to the shifting of gears .
please forgive me for my distance .
the pain is the evident in my existence .
please forgive me for my distance .
the shame is manifest in my resistance to your love , to your love , to your love .
i would 've warned you , but really , what 's the point ?
caution could , but rarely ever helps .
do n't be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint .
it 's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself .
please forgive me for my distance .
the pain is evident in my existence .
please forgive me for my distance .
the shame is manifest in my resistance to your love , to your love , to your love .
my derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you , but by the time i 'm close to you , i lose my desideratum and now you , so now you have it .
so baby tell me what 's the word ?
am i your gal , or should i get out of town ?
i just need to be reassured .
do you just deal it out , or can you deal with what i lay down ?
please forgive me , for my distance .
the pain is evident in my existence .
please forgive me for my distance .
the shame is manifest in my resistance to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love , to your love .

#limp

you want to make me sick .
you want to lick my wounds , do n't you , baby ?
you want the badge of honor when you save my hide , but you 're the one in the way of the day of doom , baby , if you need my shame to reclaim your pride .
and when i think of it , my fingers turn to fists .
i never did anything to you , man .
but no matter what i try , you 'll beat me with your bitter lies , so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; got off now , baby .
it wont be long till you 'll be lying limp in your own hands .
you feed the beast i have within me .
you wave the red flag , baby , you make it run , run , run .
standing on the sidelines , waving and grinning , you fondle my trigger , then you blame my gun .
and when i think of it , my fingers turn to fists .
i never did anything to you , man .
but no matter what i try you 'll beat me with your bitter lies so call me crazy , hold me down , make me cry ; get off now , baby .
it wont be long till you 'll be lying limp in your own hands .
and when i think of it , my fingers turn to fists .

#love ridden

love ridden , i 've looked at you with the focus i gave to my birthday candles .
i 've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow .
and baby , i wished for you .
nobody sees when you are lying in your bed , and i want to crawl in with you , but i cry instead .
i want your warm , but it will only make me colder when it 's over .
so i ca n't tonight , baby .
no , not "baby " anymore .
if i need you , i 'll just use your simple name .
only kisses on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .
my hand wo n't hold you down no more .
the path is clear to follow through .
i stood too long in the way of the door mp fiona apple , and now i 'm giving up on you .
no , not "baby " anymore .
if i need you , i 'll just use your simple name .
only kisses on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .
no , not "baby " anymore .
if i need you , i 'll just use your simple name .
only kisses on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .

#paper bag

i was staring at the sky , just looking for a star to pray on , or wish on , or something like that .
i was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy whose reality i knew was a hopeless to be had .
but then the dove of hope began its downward slope , and i believed for a moment that my chances were approaching to be grabbed .
but as it came down near , so did a weary tear .
i thought it was a bird , but it was just a paper bag .
hunger hurts , and i want him so bad , oh it kills because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up .
i got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold .
hunger hurts , but starving works , when it costs too much to love .
and i went crazy again today , looking for a strand to climb , looking for a little hope .
baby said he could n't stay , would n't put his lips to mine , and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope .
i said , "honey , i do n't feel so good , do n't feel justified .
come on put a little love here in my void . "
he said "it 's all in your head , "
and i said , " so 's everything" , but he did n't get it .
i thought he was a man but he was just a little boy .
hunger hurts , and i want him so bad , oh it kills because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up .
i got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold .
hunger hurts , but starving works , when it costs too much to love .

# a mistake

i 'm going to make a mistake .
i 'm going to do it on purpose .
i 'm going to waste my time .
because i 'm full as a tick , and i 'm scratching at the surface .
and what i find is mine .
and when the day is done , and i look back , and the fact is i had fun , fumbling around .
all the advice i shunned , and i ran where they told me not to run , but i sure had fun , so i 'm going to fuck it up again .
i 'm going to do another detour .
unpave my path .
and if you want to make sense , what you looking at me for ?
i 'm no good at math .
and when i find my way back , the fact is i just may stay , or i may not .
i 've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake .
i want to make mistake ; why ca n't i make a mistake ?
i 'm always doing what i think i should .
almost always doing everybody good .
why ?
do i want to do right ?
of course , but do i really want to feel i 'm forced to answer you ?
hell no .
i 've acquired quite a taste for a well-made mistake .
i want to make a mistake .
why ca n't i make a mistake ?
i 'm always doing what i think i should .
almost always doing everybody good .
why ?

#fast as you can

i let the beast in too soon .
i do n't know how to live without my hand on his throat .
i fight him always , and still , oh darling , it 's so sweet , you think you know how crazy how crazy i am .
you say you do n't spook easy ; you wo n't go , but i know and i pray that you will .
fast as you can , baby , run , free yourself of me , fast as you can .
i may be soft in your palm , but i 'll soon grow hungry for a fight , and i will not let you win .
my pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will disprove your faith in man .
so if you catch me trying to find my way into your heart from under your skin , fast as you can , baby , scratch me out , free yourself , fast as you can .
fast as you can , baby , scratch me out , free yourself , fast as you can .
sometimes my mind do n't shake and shift , but most of the time , it does .
and i get to the place where i 'm begging for a lift , or i 'll drown in the wonders and the was .
and i 'll be your girl , if you say it 's a gift .
and you give me some more of your drugs .
yeah , i 'll be your pet , if you just tell me it 's a gift .
because i 'm tired of whys , choking on whys .
just need a little because , because ...
i let the beast in , and then i even tried forgiving him , but it 's too soon .
so i 'll fight again , again , again , again , again .
and for a little while more , i 'll soar the uneven wind , complain and blame the sterile land .
but if you 're getting any bright ideas , quiet dear i 'm blooming within .
fast as you can , baby , wait , watch me , i 'll be out fast as i can , maybe late but at least about .
fast as you can leave me , let this thing run its route , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can .

# the way things are

i would n't know what to do with another chance if you gave it to me .
i could n't take the embrace of a real romance .
it 'd race right through me .
i 'm much better off the way things are .
much , much better off , better by far , by far .
i would n't know what to say to a gentle voice .
it 'd roll right past me .
and if you chalk it up you 'll see i do n't really have a choice so do n't even ask me .
i 'm much better off the way things are .
much , much better off , better by far .
so keep on calling me names , keep on , keep on , and i 'll keep kicking the crap till it 's gone .
if you keep on killing , you could get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .
how can i fight , when we 're on the same side ?
how can i fight beside you ?
so keep on calling me names , keep on , keep on .
and i 'll keep on kicking the crap till it 's gone .
if you keep on killing , you could get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .
so keep on callng me names , keep on , keep on .
and i 'll keep kicking the crap till it 's gone .
if you keep on killing , you could get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .

#get gone

how many times do i have to say to get away , get gone .
flip your shit past another lasses ' humble dwelling .
you got your game , made your shot , and you got away with a lot , but i 'm not turned on .
so put away that meat you 're selling .
because i do know what 's good for me , and i 've done what i could for you , but you 're not benefiting , and yet i 'm sitting singing again , sing , sing , again .
how can i deal with this , if he wo n't get with this ?
am i going to heal from this ?
he wo n't admit to it .
nothing to figure out .
i got to get him out .
it 's time the truth was out that he do n't give a shit about me .
because i do know what 's good for me , and i 've done what i could for you , but you 're not benefiting , and yet i 'm sitting singing again , sing , sing again .

he wo n't admit to it .
nothing to figure out .
i got to get him out .
it 's time the truth was out that he do n't give a shit about me .
how many times can it escalate till it elevates to a place i ca n't breathe ?
and i must decide , if you must deride , that i 'm much obliged to up and go .
i 'll idealize , then realize that it 's no sacrifice , because the price is paid and there 's nothing left to grieve .
fucking go .
because i 've done what i could for you , and i do know what 's good for me , and i 'm not benefiting , instead i 'm sitting singing again , singing again , singing again , sing , sing , sing again .
how can i deal with this , if he wo n't get with this ?

#i know

so be it .
i 'm your crowbar if that 's what i am so far , until you get out of this mess .
and i will pretend that i dont know of your sins until you are ready to confess .
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know .
and you can use my skin to bury secrets in , and i will settle you down .
and at my own suggestion , i will ask no questions while i do my thing in the background .
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know .
baby , i ca n't help you out while she 's still around .
so for the time being , i 'm being patient .
and amidst this bitterness , if you 'll just consider this , even if it do n't make sense all the time , give it time .
and when the crowd becomes your burden , and you 've early closed your curtains , i 'll wait by the backstage door while you try to find the lines to speak your mind and pry it open , hoping for an encore .
and if it gets too late , for me to wait for you to find you love me and tell me so , it 's ok , dont need to say it .
