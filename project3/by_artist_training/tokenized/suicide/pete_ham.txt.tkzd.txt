apple of my eye

oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to move away though inside my heart , i really want to stay .
believe the love we have is so sincere .
you know , the gift you have will always be .
you 're the apple of my eye .
you 're the apple of my heart , but now the time has come to part .
oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to make a stand though we never meant to bite the loving hand .
and now the time has come to walk alone .
we were the children .
now we 've overgrown .
you 're the apple of my eye .
you 're the apple of my heart , but now the time has come to part .
oh , i 'm sorry , but it 's time to move away though inside my heart , i really want to stay .
believe the love we have is so sincere .
you know , the gift you have will always be .
you 're the apple of my eye .
you 're the apple of my heart , but now the time has come to part .
now the time has come to part .
now the time has come to part .

#timeless

we are yesterday .
we are today .
we are tomorrow .
we are timeless .
we are then .
we are now .
we are the future .
we are timeless .
we are the sorrow .
we are the pain .
we are the sunshine .
we are rain .
we are love .
we are hate .
we are the future .
we are timeless .
whatever we see , wherever we go shows perfectly clear how little we know .
how can we look and not even see ?
how can we live and not even be free ?
we are the comfort .
we are the shame .
we are forgiveness .
we are blame .
we are kind .
we are kill .
are we the future ?
are we timeless ?
are we timeless ?
are we ?
are we timeless ?
are we timeless ?
are we ?
are we timeless ?
are we timeless ?
are we ?
are we timeless ?
are we ?
are we timeless ?
are we timeless ?
are we ?
are we timeless ?
are we ?

#i miss you

though you 've been gone for just a week , it makes me feel so sad to speak .
lady , come back .
i miss you .
and , though before i did n't cry , now my eyes are never dry and a thousand jesters could n't make me smile .
i miss you .
i miss you .
and now i know that i was wrong , but it 's too late for now you 've gone .
lady , come back .
i miss you .
and , though our times were good and bad , now you 're gone , i 'm always sad and a thousand jesters could n't make me smile .
i miss you .
i miss you .
i miss you .

#shine on

shine on , shine on me .
all i know is now i want you close to me .
i ca n't really tell you what the future 's going to be .
just for now , little lady , shine on me .
lean on , lean on me .
something tells me that 's the way it 's gotta be .
i ca n't really show you what the future 's going to be .
just for now , little lady , lean on me .
to fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane .
do n't think of tomorrow .
yesterday is past .
and , if you could , you know we could make it last .
drink on , drink on me .
slip and slide , so i 'll forget reality .
i ca n't really say if i 'll come on and get so free .
just for now , little lady , drink on me .
to fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane .
do n't think of tomorrow .
yesterday is past .
and , if you could , you know we could make it last .

#song for a lost friend

you had a dream .
you know you dreamt so much .
you had a dream .
you know it meant so much .
you 're just a victim of the circumstance .
i mean , what else could you do ?
you saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true .
what could you do ?
you had a goal .
you know you aimed so high .
you had soul .
you knew you had to try .
you 're just a victim of the time of day .
no matter what you say or do , you saw your dream and you just took a play and for a while your dream came true .
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
you 're just a victim of the circumstance .
i mean , what else could you do ?
you saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true .
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
what could you do ?

#matted spam

the days and nights all seemed to be wrong without you , little miss rock-n-roll .

my little lady , lift me up to the sky .
she put the stomp on my blues .
she blow the dust off my old blue suede shoes .

#lonely you

when i look into your tearful eyes , i do n't know what to do .
and , though you say that i do n't realize , i sympathize with you .
lonely you , only you .
yes , i do .
lonely you , only you .
lonely you .
when i ask you just to be my friend , i want to lend a hand , but , if we get too close , it 's sure to end .
oh , ca n't you understand ?
lonely you , only you .
yes , it will .
lonely you , only you .

we really need a friend and friends are hard to find and harder still to keep.
lonely you .
lonely me .

#crimson ship

my life was colored , painting pictures out of tune .
you came from nowhere in a song .
it might have been the way i laughed .
he made the jokes could only show me what was wrong .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
he never left me his number .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
then he was gone and i wondered .
who put the knots on all the crosses on the hill ?
why did the old man wash his hands ?
who grew the flower that was big enough to kill and blew the trumpet in the van ?
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
he never left me his number .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
then he was gone and i wondered .
oh , oh , oh , oh .
when they were busy throwing kisses at the moon , a father lost his mother 's son and , though they knew the resurrection would be soon , the time was spent .
they carried on , on .
he took me flying on his crimson ship .
he never left me his number .
he took me flying on his crimson ship
then he was gone and i wondered , wondered , wondered , wondered .

#midnight sun

oh , no , oh , no , i think it 's time for me to run .
well , i 've been working all the summer , waiting for the winter to come and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .
oh , yeah , oh , yeah , i think i 've been away too long .
well , i 've been coming and i 'm going .
all the time is growing with fun and , if you feel like something 's missing , well , come into the midnight sun .
never be a gooseberry for gooseberries should never see it .
drop the one who 's looking at you looking at the one who 's seeing you be it .
oh , yeah , oh , yeah , i think i 've been away too long .
well , i 've been waiting all the summer , counting all the trophies i 've won and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .
oh no , oh no , i think it 's time for me to run .
well , i 've been working all the summer , waiting for the winter to come and , if you feel like reminiscing , well , come into the midnight sun .

#carry on till tomorrow

in younger days , i told myself my life would be my own and i 'd leave the place where sunshine never shone for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the rising sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on till tomorow .
there 's no reason to look back .
carry on , carry on , carry on beyond the shadows of the clouds and onward to the sky .
carry on till i find the rainbow 's end for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the rising sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on till tomorow .
there 's no reason to look back .
carry on , carry on , carry on .
drifting on the wings of freedom , leave this stormy day and we 'll ride to tomorrow 's golden fields for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the rising sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on , carry on , carry on .
and , when the heavy journey 's done , i 'll rest my weary head for the world and its colours will be mine for my life 's too short for waiting .
when i see the setting sun , then i know again that i must carry on , carry on till tomorow .
there 's no reason to look back .
carry on , carry on , carry on .

# i 'm in love

# walk out in the rain

so i just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me .
and , if the rain should go away , then in my lonely room i 'll stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away .
so i just live a life of hope , pretending that i could n't care , but , if you find you cannot cope , just call my name and i 'll be there .
if i could live my life again , i still relive those precious times .
although i know there would be pain , it felt so good while you were mine .
be mine .
be mine .
be mine .
be mine .
be mine .
so i just walk out in the rain , so i just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain , so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me , thousand tears you gave .
and , if the rain should go away , and if the rain should go away , then in my lonely room i stay , then in my lonely room i stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go .
and , if you ever change your mind , you know , baby , you will find all my sorrow and my pain .
you 'll find me walking in the rain .

#knocking down our home

#i ca n't take it

just give me five so i can step outside
or even give me three and i 'll be satisfied
but if you give me none at all
you 're going to see me climb that wall
and you know you 're going to see me fall
and i ca n't take it

take all the nights that a man can give and make all the days so a man can live , but , if you take up every hour , you 're going to take up all my power and you know you 're going to turn me sour and i ca n't take it , no .
i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
give me all your money in your dark brown vase .
you 've even got my soul in your dark brown case , but , baby , ca n't you see outside ?
you know you 've got my fingers tied and you know you 're going to hurt my pride and i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it .
i ca n't take it anymore .
i ca n't take it .
place a lock upon my door .
give me all your money in your dark brown vase .
you 've even got my soul in your dark brown case , but , baby , ca n't you see outside when you know you 've got my fingers tied and you know you 're going to hurt my pride and i ca n't take it ?
i ca n't take it , oh , no .
i ca n't take it anymore .

#midnight caller

beneath the midnight caller she thinks of paper green .
you never hear them calling her name .
they just know where they 've been .
you never hear her holler .
the tears no longer come .
she reads her daily book of the past that shows of everyone .
grey years that show in her hair .
ca n't be , but do n't seem to care .
she unlocks the door and there 's no one there .
she sees a daytime stroller walk from the night before and , though she paints a smile on her face , he wo n't be back no more .
she 's got no saint to follow .
she 's got no place to go .
too proud to ask an old friend for help .
too proud to let him know .
grey years that show in her hair .
ca n't be , but do n't seem to care .
she knocks the door and there 's no one there .
nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody 's going to help you now .

# no matter what

no matter what you are i will always be with you .
does n't matter what you do , girl .
oh , girl , with you .
no matter what you do i will always be around .
wo n't you tell me what you found , girl ?
oh , girl , wo n't you ?
knock down the old gray wall and be a part of it all .
nothing to say .
nothing to see .
nothing to do .
if you would give me all as i would give it to you , nothing would be , nothing would be , nothing would be .
no matter where you go there will always be a place .
ca n't you see it in my face , girl ?
oh , girl , want you .
knock down the old gray wall .
be a part of it all .
nothing to say .
nothing to see .
nothing to do .
if you would give me all as i would give it to you , nothing would be , nothing would be , nothing would be .
no matter what you are i will always be with you .

#without you

i had you there , but then i let you go and now it 's only fair that i should let you know what you should know .

#blodwyn

i put away the knife , the chisel , and the saw .
i 've locked away my life behind this old oak door to make a simple spoon , a token of my love in hope that maybe soon it 's me you 're thinking of .
so take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn .
the valley knows the way i feel today .
so take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon takes you away .
my life may not be long , was working down below for so much can go wrong , but what else do i know ?
so take these precious years and make them precious too and say you 'll take from me what i will give to you .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn .
the valley knows the way i feel today .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon takes you away .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn .
valley knows the way i feel today .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon takes you away .

i just want my teddy bear .
i do n't want a backstage bella .
i just want to take you there .
baby , wo n't you think it over ?

let it go .
you show me all your loving .

# i 'll be the one

where did you go when you were needed ?
was it some place i know , where they care ?
cries in the rain .
i 'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart .
i 'll be the one .
we 'll be together .
i 'll be the one forever and ever .
look at me now .
am i the loser ?
if you ca n't tell me how , tell me why .
but just the same , i 'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart .
i 'll be the one .
we 'll be together .
i 'll be the one forever and ever and ever .
i 'll be the one .
we 'll be together .
i 'll be the one forever and ever and ever .

#take it all

in a way , the sun has shone on me .
makes it easy to make it hard .
take an inch , take a yard , take it all .
i do n't need it at all .
any day the sun could shine on you .
makes it silly to make it bad .
take it good , take it glad , take it all .
do n't you know there 's a stronger thing keeping us together ?
do n't you know there 's a song to sing ?
sing on .
let the feeling take you high .
do n't you know there 's a stronger thing keeping us together ?

any day , the sun will shine on you .
makes it silly to take it bad .
make it good , take it glad , take it all .
i do n't need it at all .
i do n't want it at all .
no , no , no .

#name of the game

saw the railway master and i looked him in the eye .
said , "would you go much faster if you thought that you would die ? "
he said , " not me , sir .
i could not care .
in fact , i would not try .
protest would not take me far .
it 's different , me not being a star . "
i lock my feelings in a jar until another day .
comfort me , dear brother .
wo n't you tell me what you know ?
somewhere in this painful world is a place where i can go .
oh , long-awaiting mother , is it time to make a show and take your babies to your breast ?
no , we never passed the test and all our sins should be confessed before we carry on .
oh , do n't refuse me .
if you choose me , you 'll follow my shame .
no , do n't confuse me for i know it 's the name of the game .
got up off my pillow and i looked up at the sun .
said , "you can see quite clearly now the things that we have done . "
we burned your sacred willow and our battles we have won , but did we get so very far ?
it 's different , me not being a star .
lock my feelings in a jar until we go away .
oh , do n't refuse me .
if you choose me , you 'll follow my shame .
no , do n't confuse me for i know it 's the name of the game .
oh , do n't refuse me .
if you choose me , you 'll follow my shame .
no , do n't confuse me for i know that 's the name of the game .
do n't refuse me .
do n't confuse me .
oh , oh , oh .
do n't refuse me .
do n't confuse me .
oh , oh , oh .

#day after day

i remember finding out about you .
every day my mind is all around you .
looking out from my lonely room day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .
i remember holding you while you sleep.
every day i feel the tears that you weep.
looking out of my lonely gloom day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .
looking out of my lonely room day after day .
bring it home , baby .
make it soon .
i give my love to you .

#perfection

there is no real perfection .
there 'll be no perfect day .
just love is our connection , the truth in what we say .
there 's no good revolution , just power changing hands .
there is no straight solution , except to understand .
so listen to my song of life .
you do n't need a gun or a knife .
successful conversation will take you very far .
there is no real perfection .
there 'll be no perfect man .
just peace is our connection , forgiving all you can .
there 's no good kind of killing , just power taking life .
it 's all good blood that 's spilling to make a bigger knife .
so listen to my song of life .
you do n't need a gun or a knife .
successful conversation will take you very far .
successful conversations will take you very far .
so listen to my song of life .
you do n't need a gun or a knife .
successful conversation will take you very far .
successful conversations will take you very far .
successful conversations will take you very far .

# just a chance

does n't matter what you think i do .
all i want to do is see it through .
you may say it 's not a great romance , but all i want from you is just a chance to try , any way at all .
do n't you think we know it has to hurt ?
are minds that small ?
i wo n't tell you if it 's short or long .
all i know is that it do n't feel wrong .
you may say it 's not a great romance , but all we want from you is just a chance to try any way we can .
do n't you think we know it has to hurt ?
wo n't you understand ?
does n't matter what you think i do .

#know one knows

no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when i see you glow .
no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when you let it show .
keep it coming .
keep it long .
caress me with your body song .
reach it higher with each sigh , knowing soon that we will fly .
no one knows it .
no one knows it .
no one knows it , no .
no one knows how good i feel when i see you glow .
no one knows it .

#dennis

deeper waters flowed .
recently it showed .
trying to cover your head .
trying to frighten you .
trying to fight with you .
really getting you scared .
but do n't you worry , you love of mine .
pretty soon it will all be fine and we 'll just go on , higher hills to climb , climbing all the time , trying to find a way through , falling down again on the ground again , wondering what you can do .
but do n't you worry , you love of ours .
they look like weeds , but they 're really flowers and they 'll soon be gone .
you wo n't stand up .
you wo n't sit down .
your head 's a mile above the ground .
and , though we tend to scold you now , i could n't start to tell you how , we could n't start to tell you how there 's just no way to say how much we love you , you , little dennis , you .
you 're full of new surprise .
love you .
you , little dennis with the rascal in your eyes , you 're a prize .
it could be bad .
it could be worse .
you 're taking out your mother 's purse .
and , though you cried when you got told the money there was for the old to keep their dogs from getting cold , the only thing that ca n't be sold is love .
you , little dennis , you , you 're full of new surprise .
love you .
you , little dennis with the rascal in your eyes .
will you pick up your toys ?
will you be a good boy ?
will you please , please ?
there 's a way .
there 's a way .
if you 'll play , if you 'll stay , there 's a way through .
there 's a way to take away blue , take away blue .
there 's a way .
there 's a way .
if you 'll play , if you 'll stay , there 's a way through , there 's a way to .

#meanwhile back at the ranch

why do you think me so hard to get ?
is there something they might regret ?
is it better to just forget , just forget ?
if they only would let us know , then we 'd know just how far to go , but instead they just tell us "no" , tell us "no" .
you , you always played the fool .
you always played the fool .
you always break the rule at every single school , you know .
you always break the rule .
it always pulled you down .
they could always pull you down .
you , you never stayed the same .
you never stayed the same and now you take the blame for all the little games they play .
you always take the blame and let it bring you down .
why 'd you let it bring you down ?
why do you think me so hard to get ?
is there something they might regret ?
is it better to just forget , just forget ?
