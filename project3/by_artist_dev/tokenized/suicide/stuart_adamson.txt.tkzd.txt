Alone

The midday sky was grey and purple .
At least it was n't blue .
I want the sky to be the way I am , and what I do ?
For I have been a lost and lonely sailor on your sea .
Run aground by trusting signals you were sending me .
The streets are filled with empty faces , nothing here is new .
It 's just the same in other places I have journeyed to .
I was the first across the water , the last across the land .
I walked out of the silver mine my pockets full of sand .
Alone inside my head .
Alone inside my room .
I feel alone inside my head , alone inside my tiny little world .
It 's not my life in those old pictures , the ones you threw away .
For I was always someone else and always far away .
Walking in the darkest places where the mission meets , waiting for the ground to open up beneath my feet .
Alone inside my head .
Alone inside my room .
I feel alone inside my head alone inside my tiny little world .
Alone inside my head .
Alone inside my room .
I feel alone inside my head alone inside my tiny little world .

# Beautiful People
If beauty is an ecstasy , and anger keeps you poor , a hungry man is never free , a rich man never cured .
Things were never what they used to be .
Now every crowd has its silver lining ; we all got stuff to sell .
And you may live your life so bitter , but you remember it so well .
Things were never what they used to be for all the folks who can run the world , drive cabs , or cut your hair .
And the sun may set without your help , but you 're beautiful people to me .
You may fall before you 're pushed , but it 's beautiful people I see .
If you only see the stars when it 's dark , that 's enough for me .
An empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me .
It 's all the same in different hats , the proof of the missing link , a nation talking to itself and none of us can think .
Things were never what they used to be .
For a silent fool may still be wise , there 's no way you can tell .
And the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me .
And the finest government you could buy , it 's beautiful people I see .
If you live five to one against , it 's good enough for me .
Can't use two steps to cross a canyon , you 're beautiful people to me .
If you do n't see the same trees I see , you 're beautiful people to me .
Make deserts bloom and oceans die , just beautiful people I see .
If you 're lost and dying of civilization , that 's enough for me .
If you believe your own blind eye , you 're beautiful people to me .
And you may miss what you never had and have what you do n't need .
And the sun may set without your help , but you 're beautiful people to me .
You may fall before you 're pushed , but it 's beautiful people I see .
If you only see the stars when it 's dark , that 's enough for me .
An empty soul with a full opinion is beautiful people to me .
And the captain more scared than his crew is beautiful people to me .
And the finest government you could buy , it 's beautiful people I see .
If you live five to one against , it 's good enough for me .
Can't use two steps to cross a canyon , you 're beautiful people to me .
If you do n't see the same trees I see , you 're beautiful people to me .
Make deserts bloom and oceans die , just beautiful people I see .
If you 're lost and dying of civilization , that 's enough for me .
If you believe your own blind eye , you 're beautiful people to me .

# Broken Heart ( Thirteen Valleys )

Thirteen valleys he has wandered for her love .
For he thinks he is the one that she dreams of , but her bed was made elsewhere from the first day she got there .
Now he wanders thirteen valleys crying out , now he wanders thirteen valleys crying out : " It could 've been me , I said it could 've been me . "
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
Thirteen valleys she has gone since morning came .
For she gave so much that only love remained .
But her lover is long gone with the money she sent home .
Now she wanders thirteen valleys crying out , now she wanders thirteen valleys crying out : " It could 've been me , I said it could 've been me . "
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
That broken heart will be forever and a lifetime .
That broken heart will dry up love that 's gone before .
And you may fight , and you may run , but what was past is now undone .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
Thirteen valleys lie in silence in the haze filled with promises and spirits that we raised , but the spirits all are ghosts of the ones we hurt the most and they wander thirteen valleys crying out , and they wander thirteen valleys crying out : " It could 've been me , I said it could 've been me . "
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
It could 've been me , I said it could 've been me .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
That broken heart will be forever and a lifetime .
That broken heart will dry up love that 's gone before , and you may fight , or you may run , but what was past is now undone .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .
A broken heart needs someone new to blame it on .

# Comes a Time

It 's a holy place if you see things that way , then they rattle the bones and the analysts play .
From his backward collar on a worn out book another working class poet with an abstract look .
So take me up to the edge of the world and push me over again .
Lead me up to the edge of the world .
There comes a time .
Now , shake your hair and rattle your cans , it 's a service funded by a self-made man .
He alks to victims and industrial spies .
He feeds you tobacco for the four-minute mile .
So take me up to the edge of the world and push me over again .
Lead me up to the edge of the world .
There comes a time .
With some strange god and a good right hand we can chase the ghost from the promised land .
If the promised land turns out as it should we can flood the place with consumer goods .
When the African general meets the bingo queen and the collective farmer joins the teenage dream , when the miracle worker saves the chat show host and the caveman paints another holy ghost .
So take me up to the edge of the world , and push me over again .
Lead me up to the edge of the world .
There comes a time .
So take me up to the edge of the world , and push me over again .
Lead me up to the edge of the world .
There comes a time .
We can storm the walls in our leisure wear while we trap the beast in his stormy lair .
Then we 'll smooth his image and we 'll save his soul while we fill our schools with the gold we stole .
With some strange god and a good right hand we can chase the ghost from the promised land .
If the promised land turns out as it should we can flood the place with consumer goods .

# East of Eden

I feel the way the wind blows .
It tells me where you 've been through .
I watch the way the sun sets until the night 's inside you .
Some days I just do n't worry .
I let it pour through me .
Some days I need to bury the very depths of me .
So I wait to the east of eden , I let salvation be .
I was waiting , I was watching
Would it ever be there for me ?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card where all I had to walk with me , had to walk with me .
I watch the way the crow flies and though it seems so easy .
But if I see it in a grey sky , can I be sure about the way it leaves me ?
Some days I just do n't worry .
I let it pour through me .
Some days I need to call upon the very depths of me .
So I wait out here to the east of eden .
I watch your soul run free .
I was waiting , I was watching , would it ever be there for me ?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card where all I had to walk with me .
I was waiting .
I was watching .
Would it ever be there for me ?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card where all I had to walk with me .
Some days will stay a thousand years .
Some pass like the flash of spark .
Who knows where all our days go ?
Out here we lie together .
Outside the thunder gathers .
Why care about the weather , it always ends in dark .
I looked west in search of freedom , and I saw slavery .
I looked east in search of answers , and I saw mysery .
Some days I just do n't worry .
I let it pour through me .
Some days I walk into the very depths of me .
So I wait out here to the east of eden .
I let my conscience be .
I was waiting .
I was watching .
Would it ever be there for me ?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card where all I had to walk with me .
I was waiting .
I was watching .
Would it ever be there for me ?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card where all I had to walk with me .

# Heart of the World

I believe in strangers , wherever they may be .
All the souls who shape the world look pretty strange to me .
Never met no president or shook a Gandhi 's hand , but I believe we need a love that they may understand .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is black without the love , love to bring it back .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is blue without the love , love of me and you .
I believe in heroes , whoever they may be .
I never saved no universe or set Mandela free .
Never sang with Lennon or played in Jimi 's band .
I believe we need a love that they would understand .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is black , without the love , love to bring it back .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is blue , without the love , love of me and you .
I believe in strangers , wherever they may be .
All the souls who shape the world look pretty strange to me .
I believe in anyone , whoever they may be who feels the love that I feel and who sees the need I see .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is black , without the love , love to bring it back .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is blue , without the love , love of me and you .
Heart of the world , heart of the world is black without the love , the love to bring it back .
I tell you , heart of the world , heart of the world is blue , without the love , the love of me and you .

# I 'm not Ashamed

We all make our plans .
We all have our choices .
Try on different faces ; talk in other voices .
I said a lot of things that never let me sleep.
Made promises I really meant to keep.
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I took the blame when I could have run .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I know I stayed when I could have gone .
I do n't expect it to be easy for me .
We 're tied together by a simple little pledge .
Before we know the trust it takes to walk up to that edge we build a house of cards where the wind has always blown .
We build our little garden on a bed of sand and stone .
It took too long for me to be who I am .
Maybe it 's enough for me to be it when I can .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I took the blame when I could have run .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I know I stayed when I could have gone .
Our little houses where the wind has always blown , our little garden on a bed of sand and stone .
We drift along in quiet waters on the tide .
We rise and fall in rhythm almost satisfied .
We let ourselves be down .
we let ourselves be used .
I only ever wanted to be taken in by you .
It took too long for me to be who I am .
Maybe it 's enough for me to be it when I can .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I took the blame when I could have run .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I know I stayed when I could have gone .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I took the blame when I could have run .
I 'm not ashamed of the things I 've done .
I know I stayed when I could have gone .
I do n't expect it to be easy for me .

# Just a Shadow

It went so well for you , with a place right where you wanted , and the ones to fill it too .
But some blows break the spell that it hits you everyday until you need to hit as well .
It 's just a shadow of the man you should be .
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see .
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled , and it feels like hell .
It all seems fine for you till the struggle of ambition turned in violence upon you .
Sometimes a landslide comes .
If you 're hiding in that avalanche , you need a place to run .
It 's just a shadow of the woman you should be .
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see .
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled , and it feels like hell .
I know there is no need for what 's been done .
I know there is enough for everyone , but frustration brings a heavy hand to bear , and there 's never been a hand .
Did we ever have it good ?
While we lived in El Dorado did we find the gold we should ?
If it really was the truth , why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth ?
It 's just a shadow of the people we should be .
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see .
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled , and it feels like hell .
Know there is no need for what 's been done .
I know there is enough for everyone , but frustration brings a heavy hand to bear , and there never is a hand outside that cares .
Still the promise comes of living fit for it all .
If we only get our back against the wall ,
I look at backs that push the wall for years .
Scarred by many knives and too much fear .

# King of Emotion

One , two , one , two , three , four .
I know where all that time has gone , blown and drifted , listening to an August night .
I see where I was wrong .
How could I know that you were right when you said I would need something wild , something crazy to carry me .
I would see you naked and weary , but with pride in your eyes that put shame in me .
I wait to find the things I need but I know I want that love , king of emotion .
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
Say , na na , na na , du , di di na na , na na na , du du .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
You know where all that time was gone , grown up and left , washed out like an April day .
See all those pretty little things you knew .
Worn and faded , they lie cast away because you said , you would need something wild , something special to carry you .
You would see me naked and weary , but with pride in my eyes that put shame in you .
Until you find the things you need I know , I want , I want that love , king of emotion .
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
Say , na na , na na , du , di di , na na , na na na , du du .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
Until we find the things we need , I know I want that love , king of emotion .
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
I want that love , king of emotion .
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
Say , na na , na na , du , di di , na na , na na na , du du .
I know that love is king of emotion .
I want that love , king of emotion .
Stronger than you and so much deeper than me .
I know that love is king of emotion .
King of emotion take a walk with me .
Say , na na , na na , du , di di , na na , na na na , du du .
I know that love is king of emotion .

# Look Away

This time we run .
This time we hide .
This time we draw on all the fire we have inside .
We need some time to find a place where I can wipe away the madness from your face .
Our name is out .
Our name is known .
Our name is everywhere , but who knows where we 're flown .
I never meant to kill a man , but I will show you how to live like no one can .
So look away , look away .
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold .
Look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
Look away , look away from the love that I hide way down deep in my soul .
I met you wild in a snowed up town .
When I was waiting , tied , and bound to be sent down .
Then I broke loose .
You were n't around .
So I raised banks and trains until I tracked you down .
Now look away , look away .
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold .
Look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
Look away , look away from the love that I hide way down deep in my soul .
You followed me when I said no .
You lay with me when there was nowhere safe to go .
We made some friends , but now it 's done .
I always knew that we would never find the sun .
So look away , look away .
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold .
Look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
Look away , look away from the love that I hide way down deep in my soul .
Now look away , look away .
Hide your eyes from the land where I lie cold .
Look away , look away from the lies in the stories that were told .
Look away , look away from the love that I hide way down deep in my soul .

# One Great Thing

If there 's one great thing to happen in my life , if there 's one great day , if there 's one great height , let it be the time for peace .
Let it be the time of right
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life
I 've seen too much of what fighting has done .
I 've seen too much anger and I 've seen it far too young .
And talk will come to nothing while the shouting still goes on .
But we are only singers until better songs are sung .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life , if there 's one great day , if there 's one great height , let it be the time for peace
Let it be the time of right .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life .
I 've seen the way of martyrs , and I 've seen the way of kings .
I 've seen the hope that love can bring .
I only hope what pleases me will also pleasure you , for might can never be the hands that make a dream come true .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life , If there 's one great day , if there 's one great height , Let it be the time for peace .
let it be the time of right .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life .
I 've seen too much of what fighting has done .
I 've see too much anger , and I 've seen it far too young .
I 've seen the way of martyrs , and I 've seen the way of kings .
I 've seen the hope that love can bring .
I only hope what pleases me will also pleasure you , for might can never be the hands that make a dream come true .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life , if there 's one great day , if there 's one great height , let it be the time for peace .
let it be the time of right .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life , if there 's one great day , if there 's one great height , let it be the time for peace .

If there 's one great thing to happen in my life .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life , if there 's one great day , if there 's one great height , let it be the time for peace .
let it be the time of right .
If there 's one great thing to happen in my life .

# Peace in Our Time

Who holds the money ?
Who holds the need ?
Who holds the strings of misery , or the purse of greed ?
And the gunmen reap while the gangsters sow , and law is cheap when the smugglers go .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
While I have a life to live , then I have no life to give .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
In sun kissed rooms , in city slums , minds are restless till the airmail comes .
From the forest floor to the western mind , a chat show topic on a party line .
And the hardest love of all is to forgive as the world comes tumbling down .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
While I have a life to live , then I have no life to give .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
Let all the rain come down on blind desire .
And like a thundercloud that holds a prairie fire .
I hear the blame , and I see the cause : a stronger voice and a stronger law .
But buyers buy and sellers sell public consumption of a private hell .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
While I have a life to live , then I have no life to give .
Give us peace .
They 're gonna give us peace in our time .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
Give us peace .
Give us peace in our time .
While I have a life to live , then I have no life to give .
Give us peace .
Yeah , give us peace in our time .

# Save Me

No turning back .
No looking around .
I was n't searching .
See , what I found inside the spaces inside of me .
If there 's a reason , what will it be ?
Come on and save me .
Come on and save me .
I want to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
Go on and change me .
Hey , rearrange me .
I need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
I thought I knew .
I had my hope .
Swing in the changes , ring out the old .
I 'm happy chasing what I ca n't reach .
I 'm still embracing secrets I meet .
Come on and save me .
Come on and save me .
I want to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
Go on and change me .
Hey , rearrange me .
I need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
I wasted time .
But that was n't mine .
I hung the jury .
I fled the crime .
Shake off tomorrow .
Break off the past .
I know that sorrow .
It never lasts .
Come on and save me .
Come on and save me .
I need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
Go on and change me .
Hey , rearrange me .
I need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .
Come on and save me .
Come on and save me .
I want to know if you 're the one that 's gonna change me .
Go on and change me .
Hey , rearrange me .
I need to know if you 're the one that 's gonna save me .

# Ships ( Where were You )

Look at him now , another used man .
Wearing the passing of his dignity with all the courage that he can .
He stood in the storm , carved out in stone .
He said I 've worn my honesty with pride in everything I 've done .
So where were you when my ship went down ?
Where were you when I ran aground ?
Where were you when I turned it around ?
Where were you when they burned me down ?
Where were you when my ship went down ?
Where were you when I ran aground ?
Where were you when I turned it around ?
Where were you when they burned me down ?
Look at her now , all tired and worn .
She never thought her life would come to be so cold or so alone .
She walked in the light , fought bondage for love .
She said I cast off the chains that I was born with , but it never was enough .
And where were you when my ship went down ?
Where were you when I ran aground ?
Where were you when I turned it around ?
Where were you when they burned me down ?
Where were you when my ship went down ?
Where were you when I ran aground ?
Where were you when I turned it around ?
Where were you when they burned me down ?
Silent souls washed up on the shore left to walk the sands evermore , evermore .
Look at you now , just chasing your life .
Make like the saviour of the planet .
You 're just trying to get by .
Now you may walk the line , you may see it all through , but I know you cry yourself to sleep at night just wondering what to do .
So where were you when my ship went down ?
Where were you when I ran aground ?
Where were you when I turned it around ?
Where were you when they burned me down ?
Where were you when my ship went down ?
Where were you when I ran aground ?
Where were you when I turned it around ?
Where were you when they burned me down ?

# The Teacher

We talked and smoked all through the night .
You led me where I had no sight till birdsong broke the morning light .
And I was weak with strange delight .
Teacher will you show to me the bond between the land and sea ?
I am new to mystery .
I want everything laid out for me , all of history , all of history .
You showed me walls around the world where seekers passed and flags unfurled .
You wove a tale in silken curls , and blew the mist in silver swirls .
Teacher will you show to me the bond between the land and sea ?
I am new to mystery .
I want everything laid out for me , all of history , all of history .
Teacher will you show to me the bond between the land and sea ?
I am new to mystery .
I want everything laid out for me , all of history , all of history , all of history , all of history .

# Where the Rose is Sown

We 're at war all the papers say .
We will win , I read today .
We are strong .
It was n't us .
We are right .
Who started this ?
Leave your work .
I just left school .
Leave your home .
I am no fool .
Take up arms .
It left me strong .
Sound alarms , the school bell rings .
Sons of men , who stand like Gods .
We give life to feed the cause , and run to ground our heathen foe .
Our name will never die .
This time will be forever .
Join up here .
I wave goodbye .
We need you , oh my breast sighs .
Have no fear .
Now I must try .
God will be with braver men .
Take the vow .
I know it 's right .
Praise the flag , the good fight .
We 're at war .
I 'm on my way .
We will win .
Why do I pray ?
Sons of men who stand like Gods .
We give life to feed the cause , and run to ground our heathen foe .
Our name will never die .
This time will be forever .
I wait here in this hole playing poker with my soul .
I hold the rifle close to me .
It lights the way to keep me free .
If I die in a combat zone , box me up and ship me home .
If I die and still come home , lay me where the rose is sown .
Sons of men who stand like Gods .
We give life to feed the cause .
And run to ground our heathen foe .
Our name will never die .
This time will be forever .

# You Dreamer

Down at the corner store , never busy any more , he 's in the back room talking pie .
In there all by himself counting bugs up on the shelf , watching the window fill with flies .
Oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
Meanwhile in the great indoors , pizza boxes on the floor prescription junkies pass the day .
TV actors screw around wrapped in silk and dressing gowns , a grown up drama for a day .
Oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
You know there 's house on Victory Street where no one wipes their feet .
A car is rusting in the yard .
Mommy scrubs and daddy scores , keeps his stash beneath the floor , under the bed of baby blue .
I need a guide book .
Get me a map .
Not even Indiana Jones could deal with that .
The tank is empty .
A wheel came off .
How can someone find me if no one knows I 'm lost , hey if no one knows I 'm lost ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the way that you believed your life was gonna turn out ?
Oh you dreamer , is this the better world that you were making all those plans for .

# Hold the Heart

Sun beats hard on an empty beach where I tried so hard , but could n't reach the stars in your eyes .
You were just a child when I came to you , and we were friends 'till love stepped in , and you stepped away .
I would lie and curse the day , and visit places where we lay alone , and find them turned to stone .
Because you hold the heart of someone new .
I 'll take a chance on time .
Hold out here for something true , standing out of line .
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
The way you will again .
I fell apart , and you came to me .
I never can explain how much it turned me round , much more than upside down .
' Cause you hold the heart of someone new .
I 'll take a chance on time .
Hold out here for something true , standing out of line .
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
The way you will again .
And I love the sun .
And I need the rain .
And I know the way that you left me was only to test me , and I was vain .
And I will be strong .
And I will be warm .
And I will let no one come near me until you will hear me just once again .
Time will wear the mountain down , and make a lover of the clown who laughed too long , and colored you wrong .
Now I hold the heart of someone new .
I 'll take a chance on time .
Hold out here for something true , standing out of line .
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
The way you will again .
But I would wait a hundred years to hear you say my name the way you did before he came .
The way you will again .

# You , Me , and the Truth

There may be trouble ahead .
There may be light in the distance .
It may be something you said .
Maybe my lack of resistance .
It took you so long to be young , and just a second to be old .
Leave me a moment in the sun .
I 've got forever to be cold .
Some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
How did you learn to be kind ?
Where did you learn to be honest ?
How do you learn to be blind ?
Why do you whisper the promise ?
If you ca n't have what you want , why do n't you use what yov 've got ?
I wo n't do things that I ca n't .
I ca n't be something that I 'm not .
Some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
Some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
Maybe we should just be friends .
Maybe we 'd be better strangers .
I know that everything ends .
I know the color of danger .
All we do is hide the fire .
We just forget about the smoke .
Is that a smile with a future , or just a farewell to hope .
Some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
Some people can find a way to get this thing together , but there 's me , and there 's you , then there 's the truth .
But there 's me , And there 's you then there 's the truth .
