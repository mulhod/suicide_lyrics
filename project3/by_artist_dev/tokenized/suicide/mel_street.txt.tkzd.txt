# # Borrowed Angel

Her fingers feel so gentle with her hand in mine .
Her hair feels like silk on my arm .
Her lips tell me so tenderly she 's mine alone , until we part tonight and she goes home .
Borrowed angel belongs to someone else .
I love my borrowed angel I just ca n't help myself .
That ring on her finger do n't belong to me , but she loves me and I know she 'll save some borrowed time for me .
I wish that I could have her more than just tonight .
We ca n't go on like this .
It is n't right .
When that lonesome feeling comes knocking on my door , I 'll call my borrowed angel to ease the pain once more .
Borrowed angel .
But she loves me , and I know she 'll save some borrowed time for me .

# # You Make Me Feel More Like a Man

There 's a ring on my finger .
There 's a girl who waits at home .
I 'm ashamed of what I 'm doing , but I keep cheating on .
When I tell you that I miss her , will you try to understand that she 's the one I love , but you make me feel more like a man ?
Yes she 's the one I love , but here I am with you .
Guilty of the one thing I said I 'd never do .
I know that I should let you go , but I do n't think I can .
I do n't know what you 've got , but it makes me feel more like a man .
Now I do n't want to hurt her , for she means the world to me .
But I live in fear that she 'll find out I 'm where I should n't be .
If she knew that I was with you , I know she 'd never understand .
For she 's the one I love , but you make me feel more like a man .
Yes she 's the one I love .

# # I Met a Friend of Yours Today

Yes I know I 'm late getting home tonight .
Can supper wait ?
I guess I 've lost my appetite .
Yes you can fix me a drink and anything 's okay .
Oh by the way I met a friend of yours today .
I was way on the other side of town , and coming home I thought I 'd stop and have a round .
And in this bar I heard someone speak your name , and that 's how I met a friend of yours today .
I listened for a time , and I could tell that stranger there he knew you much too well .
And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face .
Oh what a shame I met a friend of yours today .
Please do n't cry woman because it 's much too late for tears .
Yes I 'm sorry too cause it hurts after all these years .
And ai n't it sad a love like ours should end this way , and all because I met a friend of yours today .
And ai n't it sad a love like ours should end this way , and all because I met a friend of yours today .

## Town Where You Live

Twenty miles of memories until I pass right by your home .
And I always wondered if you 're a little disturbed as this big rig roars along .
Because I know you have n't forgotten when we had so much love to give , and that 's why I rather die than drive through the town where you live .
I always noticed your two Cadilacs and your twenty acre lawn and that big house of stone and marble look so empty and so alone .
And the tears they blur my vision , as I picture you there with him , and I 'd rather drive a thousand miles around the town where you live .
I remember when you said that a truck-driving man could n't give you the things you desire , and your hands look better with diamonds , and you 'd rather ride a chauffered driven car .
Well I guess that tonight you 've got all these things , but are you missing the love I can give .
If you are then Darling be waiting when I pass through the town where you live .
If you 're lonely then Darling be waiting when I pass through the town where you live .

# # Even if I Have to Steal

Even if I have to steal your love , I want you .
Heaven help me .
My heart is in your hands .
When you look at me with your eyes so inviting , tempting me to cross over the line , that 's when I lose control of my conscience , and I 'd do anything at all to make you mine .
Even if I have to steal your love , I want you .
And I 'll steal you from him if I can .
Even if I have to steal your love , I need you .
Heaven help me .
My heart is in your hands .
When you 're near me , I 'm like a thief on the corner without honor .
I do n't know .
It 's a shame .
It 's only when I 'm alone I feel guilty .
My conscience hurts me , but I still feel the same .
Even if I have to steal .
Even if I have to steal your love , I want you .
Heaven help me .
My heart is in your hands .
