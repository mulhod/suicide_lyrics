#The Fucked Up Blues

I got the fucked-up blues.
I got the fucked-up blues.
Lord, what can you do about the fucking fucked-up blues?
Well, the beans have been baking upon the camel's hump like a voodoo curse in an old lady's purse, confetti on my grave.
I got the fucked-up blues.
I got the fucked-up blues.
Lord, what can you do about the fucking fucked-up blues?
I got the fucked-up blues.
I got the fucked-up blues.
Lord, what can you do about the fucking fucked-up blues?
I woke up on the futon and my boots were on fire.

#Special People

Special people all the time.
Special people on my mind.
Special people, brown and white.
Special people getting all uptight.
Special people kiss my soul.
Special people take control.
Special people lick the ground.
Special people, word up and down.
Special people squeeze the breeze.
Special people slice their knees.
Special people soak up fire.
Special people climbing higher.
Special people create belief.
Special people steal some beef.
Special people don't need your plans.
Special people got recycling cans.
Special people got songs to sing.
Special people are happening.
Special people stopping fast.
Special people hauling ass.
Special people are so sincere.
Special people got special beer.
Special people flick the grease.
Special people come in peace.
Special people will scrimp and save.
Special people will never bathe.
Special people in hot pursuit.
Special people got the boot.
Special people sleep in moss.
Special people got the sauce.
Special people open wide.
Special people ain't satisfied.

#Bogus Soul

Fucking on my, fucking on my floor, fucking off, fucking talking to me, fucking talking to me.
Oh, and I won't and I tell how the people, they want my soul.
They want to touch me with my finger.
Oh, they feel, oh!
I want to think.
I want to feel.
I don't got no tail.
I rock-n-roll my rack-n-roll.
I got the soul.
I got the soul.
Got the soul.
You got the soul.
She got the soul.
She rock-n-roll.
She got the soul.
She got the roll.
She gots a soul.

#Rowboat

Rowboat, row me to the shore.
She don't want to be my friend no more.
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul.
She don't want to be my friend no more.
Pick me up, give me some food to eat.
In your truck, going no place.
I'll be home, talking to nobody.
You'll be strange.
you'll be far away.
Big, fat moon and my body's out of tune with the burning waves.
She's a billion years away, dog food on the floor, and I been like this before.
She is all and everything else is small.
Pick me up, give me some alcohol.
In your truck, playing the radio.
I'll be home with the gasoline.
You'll be stoned.
you'll be far away.
Rowboat, row me to the shore.
She don't want to be my friend no more.
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul.
She is all and everything else is small.

#Satan Gave Me A Taco

Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick.
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick.
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard.
I was getting kind of dizzy eating all the lard.
There was aphids on the lettuce and I ate every one.
And, after I was done, the salsa melted off my tongue, pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat, and the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat.
My stomach was trembling and I broke out in a rash.
I was so dry and thirsty and I didn't have no cash, so I went and found a hose, tore off all my clothes, turned on the water and it shot right up my nose.
Some old lady came along and she thought I was a freak, so she beat me with a handbag till I could hardly speak.
I was lying there naked, my body badly bruised, in a pool of my own blood, unconscious and confused.
Well, the cops came and got me and threw me in their van and I woke up on the ceiling and I couldn't find my hand.
They took me to the judge, his eyes glowing red.
The courtroom was filled with witches and the dead.
Well, the sheriff was a hellhound with fangs and claws.
The prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls.
The air was getting thick, the smoke was getting thicker.
The judge read the verdict, said, "Cut off his head!"
Well, they placed me on the altar and they raised up the axe.
My head was about to explode when I noticed the Marshall stacks.
I noticed all the smoke machines, cameras and the lights, some guy with a microphone running around, dancing in tights, and I noticed the crew and the band playing down below, and I realized I was in a rock video.
So I went and joined the band and I went out on tour and I smoked a lot of heroin and I passed out in manure.
I made out with the groupies, started fires backstage.
I made a lot of money and I gave it all away.
Well, the band got killed, so I started a solo career and I won all the awards and I drank all the beer.
I opened up a taco stand just to smell the smell, cooking with the devil, frying down in hell.

#Whiskeyclone, Hotel City 1997

One more time.
I was born in this hotel, washing dishes in the sink, magazines and free soda, trying hard not to think.
Lay it on to the dawn.
Everything we done is wrong.
I'll be lonesome when I'm gone.
Lay it on to the dawn.
She can talk to squirrels, oh, ho, yeah.
Coming back from the convalescent home, oh, staring at sports cars, crying.
Rattlesnake on the ceiling, gunpowder on my sleeve.
I will live here forever with the ocean and the bees.
Lay it on to the dawn.
Everything we done is wrong.
I'll be lonesome when I'm gone.
Lay it on to the dawn.
Lay it on to the dawn.

#Steal My Body Home

Put me in a hole in the ground with the money and the towel and the women all running around.
Can't complain about the mess.
Mama killed the only dress.
Now she's longing for the pines.
Watch my troubles all unwind.
Drinking gasoline and wine.
Catch a chill off the stove.
On the train they cannot feel.
Lost my head beneath the wheel.
Now she steals my body home.
The trees are fake, the air is dead.
The birds are stuffed with poison lead and the ground is much too clean.
And, if it's only me who's scared, strap them to the electric chairs.
Ring the moon like a broken bell.
When she drags you from the hill, daddy's going to burn down the still.
We can watch it from the rooftop.
Lay in to the frying pan.
Now she kisses her own hand, with the fiddle on the fire.
I took a leap into the fog, sleeping on a hollow log.
Now I'm coughing with no mouth.
You can keep yourself inside, but you know you cannot lie when the devil's your only friend.

#The Golden Age

Put your hands on the wheel.
Let the golden age begin.
Let the window down.
Feel the moonlight on your skin.
Let the desert wind cool your aching head.
Let the weight of the world drift away instead.
These days I barely get by.
I don't even try.
It's a treacherous road with a desolated view.
There's distant lights, but here they're far and few and the sun don't shine even when it's day.
You got to drive all night just to feel like you're ok.
These days I barely get by.
I don't even try.

#It's All In Your Mind

Well, it's all in your mind.
Well, it's all in your mind.
It's all in your mind.
Well, it's all in your mind.
And I wanted to be, and I wanted to be your good friend.
Well, I cannot believe you got a devil up your sleeve and he's talking to me and I cannot believe.
And I wanted to be, and I wanted to be your good friend.
Well, you're all scared and stiff, a sick stolen gift, and the people you're with, they're all scared and stiff.
And I wanted to be, and I wanted to be your good friend.

#Sexx Laws

Can't you hear those cavalry drums hijacking your equilibrium?
Midnight hags in the mausoleum where the pixilated doctors moan.
Carnivores in the Cowloon night breathing freon by the candlelight.
Coquettes bitch-slap you so polite till you thank them for the tea and sympathy.
I want to defy the logic of all sex laws.
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists.
I'll let you be my chaperone at the halfway home.
I'm a full-grown man, but I'm not afraid to cry.
Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine.
Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line running buckwild like a concubine whose mother never held her hand.
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz, wearing hepatitis contact lens.
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends with Sports Illustrated moms.
I want to defy the logic of all sex laws.
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists.
I'll let you be my chaperone at the halfway home.
I'm a full-grown man, but I'm not afraid to cry.
