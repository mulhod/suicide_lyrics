Walk the Line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
I find it very, very easy to be true.
I find myself alone when each day is through.
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night, and happiness I've known proves that it's right.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
You've got a way to keep me on your side.
You give me cause for love that I can't hide.
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

#There You Go

You're going to break another heart.
You're going to tell another lie.
Well here I am, and there you go; you're gone again.
I know you're going to be the way you've always been.
Breaking hearts and telling lies is all you know.
Another guy gives you the eye, and there you go.
There you go.
You're gone again.
I should have known, I couldn't win.
There you go.
You're by his side.
You're going to break another heart.
You're going to tell another lie.
Because I love you so I take much more than I should take.
I want you even though I know my heart is going to break.
You build me up, and for a while I'm all a-glow then your fickle heart sees someone else, and there you go.
Thre you go.
You're gone again.
I should have known, I couldn't win.
There you go.
You're by his side.
You're going to break another heart.
You're going to tell another lie.

#Don't Take Your Guns to Town

A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm.
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm.
He changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair down, and his mother cried as he walked out: Don't take your guns to town, son. 
Leave your guns at home Bill.
Don't take your guns to town.
He laughed and kissed his mom and said your Billy Joe's a man.
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can, but I wouldn't shoot without a cause, I'd gun nobody down, But she cried again as he rode away: Don't take your guns to town son.
Leave your guns at home Bill.
Don't take your guns to town.
He sang a song as on he rode, his guns hung at his hips.
He rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lips.
He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down.
But his mother's words echoed again: Don't take your guns to town son.
Leave your guns at home Bill.
Don't take your guns to town.
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand and tried to tell himself at last he had become a man.
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down, and he heard again his mothers words: Don't take your guns to town son.
Leave your guns at home Bill.
Don't take your guns to town.
Filled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw, but the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw.
As Billy Joe fell to the floor, the crowd all gathered around, and wondered at his final words: Don't take your guns to town son.
Leave your guns at home Bill.
Don't take your guns to town.

#Understand Your Man

Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving.
I won’t even turn my head.
Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking.
I’ll be gone, like I said.
You’d just say the same old things that you be sayingall along.
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I’m gone.
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan.
Understand your man.
I'm tired of your bad mouthing.
Understand your man.
Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army, and everything else I leave behind.
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling, while I'm untangling my mind.
I ain't going to repeat what i said anymore, while I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before.
I'll be as gone as the wild gruesome winter, then you'll understand your man.
Meditate on it.
You hear me talking now.
Understand your man.
Remember what i told you.
Understand your man.

#Folsom Prison Blues

I hear the train coming.
It's rolling around the bend.
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps dragging on, but that train keeps rolling on down to San Antone.
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns," but I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry.
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car.
They're probably drinking coffee, and smoking big cigars, but I know I had it coming.
I know I can't be free, but those people keep moving, and that's what tortures me.
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine, I bet I'd move out over a little, farther down the line.
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay, and I'd let that lonesome whistle, blow my Blues away. 

#What is Truth

The old man turned off the radio said, "Where did all of the old songs go?
Kids sure play funny music these days.
They play it in the strangest ways."
Said: "It looks to me like they've all gone wild.
It was peaceful back when I was a child"
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys are trying to be heard above your noise?
And the lonely voice of youth cries "What is truth?"
A little boy of three sitting on the floor looks up and says: "Daddy, what is war?"
"Son, that's when people fight and die."
The little boy of three says: "Daddy, why?"
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school being taught the golden rule, and by the time another year has gone around it may be his turn to lay his life down.
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking: "What is truth?"
A young man sitting on the witness stand.
The man with the book says "Raise your hand."
"Repeat after me, I solemnly swear..."
The man looked down at his long hair, and, although the young man solemnly swore, nobody seems to hear anymore, and it didn't really matter if the truth was there, it was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair.
And the lonely voice of youth cries: "What is truth?"
The young girl dancing to the latest beat has found new ways to move her feet.
The young man speaking in the city square is trying to tell somebody that he cares.
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild are going to be the leaders in a little while.
This old world's waking to a new born day, and I solemnly swear that it'll be their way.
You better help the voice of youth find what is truth.

#Flesh and Blood

Beside a singing mountain stream where the willow grew, where the silver leaf of maple sparkled in the morning dew, I braided twigs of willows.
Made a string of buckeye beads, but flesh and blood need flesh and blood, and you're the one I need.
Flesh and blood need flesh and blood, and you're the one I need.
I leaned against a bark of birch, and I breathed the honey dew.
I saw a North-bound flock of geese against a sky of baby blue.
Beside the lily pads I carved a whistle from a reed.
Mother Nature's quite a lady, but you're the one I need.
Flesh and blood need flesh and blood, and you're the one I need.
A cardinal sang just for me, and I thanked him for the song.
Then the Sun went slowly down the West, and I had to move along.
These were some of the things on which my mind and spirit feed, but flesh and blood need flesh and blood, and you're the one I need.
Flesh and blood need flesh and blood, and you're the one I need.
So when this day was ended, I was still not satisfied, for I knew everything I touched would wither and would die.
Love is all that will remain and grow from all these Seeds.
Mother Nature's quite a Lady, but you're the one I need.
Flesh and blood need flesh and blood, and you're the one I need.

#Man in Black

Well, you wonder why I always dress in black.
Why you never see bright colors on my back, and why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, living in the hopeless, hungry side of town.
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, but is there because he's a victim of the times.
I wear the black for those who never read, or listened to the words that Jesus said, about the road to happiness through love and charity.
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose, in our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes, but just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, up front there ought to be a man in black.
I wear it for the sick and lonely old.
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold.
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been; each week we lose a hundred fine young men.
And, I wear it for the thousands who have died, believing that the Lord was on their side.
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died, believing that we all were on their side.
Well, there's things that never will be right I know, and things need changing everywhere you go, but till we start to make a move to make a few things right, you'll never see me wear a suit of white.
Oh, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day, and tell the world that everything's OK, but I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back.
till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.

#Hey Porter

Hey porter! 
Hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be till we cross that Mason Dixon Line?
At daylight would you tell that engineer to slow it down, or better still, just stop the train, because I want to look around.
Hey porter! 
Hey porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be till I can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer to ring his bell and ask everybody that ain't asleep to stand right up and yell.
Hey porter! 
Hey porter!
It's getting light outside.
This old train is puffing smoke, and I have to strain my eyes.
But ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please, because I smell frost on cotton leaves and I feel that Southern breeze.
Hey porter! 
Hey porter!
Please get my bags for me.
I need nobody to tell me now that we're in Tennessee.
Go tell that engineer to make that lonesome whistle scream.
We're not so far from home so take it easy on the steam.
Hey porter! 
Hey porter!
Please open up the door when they stop the train.
I'm going to get off first because I can't wait no more.
Tell that engineer I said thanks a lot, and I didn't mind the fare.
I'm going to set my feet on southern soil and breathe that southern air.

#Cry, Cry, Cry

Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights of town.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
When the lights have lost their glow, you're going to cry, cry, cry.
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call to me but I'm going to tell you: "Bye, bye, bye."
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,
You're going to cry, cry, cry, and you'll cry alone.
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own, you're going to cry, cry, cry.
I lie awake at night to wait till you come in.
You stay a little while and then you're gone again.
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie.
For every lie you tell, you're going to cry, cry, cry.
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you.
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and you going to ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.
You're going to cry, cry, cry, and you'll want me there.
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're going to cry, cry, cry.

#Luther Played the Boogie

We were just a plain old hillbilly band with a plain old country style.
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild.
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat.
We played a blues song kind of slow and sweet, but the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh wee, when Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie in a strangest kind of way.
Play it strange.
Well, we did our best to entertain.
Everywhere we'd go, we'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show.
Played jumping jive to make them get in the groove.
We played sad songs real slow and smooth, but the only thing that'd make them move was, ooh wee, When Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie-woogie.
Luther played the boogie in a strangest kind of way.
Now didn't Luther play the boogie strange?

#Get Rhythm

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues.
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues.
Get a rock-n-roll feeling in your bones.
Put taps on your toes and get gone.
Get rhythm when you get the blues.
A Little shoeshine boy never gets low down, but he's got the dirtiest job in town.
Bending low at the people's feet on the windy corner of the dirty street.
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes how'd he keep from getting the blues.
He grinned as he raised his little head popped a shoeshine rag and then he said: Get rhythm when you get the blues.
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues.
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine.
It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind.
Get rhythm when you get the blues.
Get rhythm when you get the blues.
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues.
Get a rock-n-roll feeling in your bones.
Put taps on your toes and get gone.
Get rhythm when you get the blues.
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy, and I thought I was going to jump for joy.
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right.
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight.
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away.
I said you're a mighty little boy to be working that way.
He said I like it with a big wide grin.
Kept on popping and he said again: Get rhythm when you get the blues.
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues.
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe.
Does a million dollars worth of good for you.
Get rhythm when you get the blues.

#Give my Love to Rose

Found him by the railroad track this morning.
I could see that he was nearly dead.
I knelt down beside him and I listened just to hear the words the dying fellow said.
He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco.
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done.
I was trying to get back to Louisiana to see my Rose and get to know my son.
Give my love to Rose, please won't you mister.
Take her all my money.
Tell her to buy some pretty clothes.
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him, and don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Tell them I said thanks for waiting for me.
Tell my boy to help his mom at home.
Tell my Rose to try to find another, for it ain't right that she should live alone.
Mister here's a bag with all my money.
It won't last them long the way it goes.
God bless you for finding me this morning, and don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Give my love to Rose, please won't you mister.
Take her all my money.
Tell her to buy some pretty clothes.
Tell my boy his daddy's so proud of him, and don't forget to give my love to Rose.

#Big River

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, and I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are going to flood you Big River.
Then I'm going to sit right here until I die.
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, and it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavorting in Davenport, and I followed you, Big River, when you called.
Then you took me to St. Louis later on, down the river.
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough.
Dump my blues down in the gulf.
She loves you, Big River, more than me.
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry, and I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are going to flood you Big River.
Then I'm going to sit right here until I die.

#Picking Time

Got cotton in the bottom land.
It's up and growing, and I got a good stand.
My good wife and them kids of mine going to get new shoes, come Picking Time, get new shoes come Picking Time.
Every night when I go to bed I thank the Lord that my kids are fed.
They live on beans eight days and nine, but I get them fat come Picking Time, get them fat come come Picking Time.
The corn is yellow, and the beans are high.
The sun is hot in the summer sky.
The work is hard till laying by, laying by till Picking Time, laying by til Picking Time.
It's hard to see by the coal-oil light, and I turn it off pretty early at night because a jug of coal-oil costs a dime, but I stay up late come Picking Time, stay up late come Picking Time.
My old wagon barely gets me to town.
I patched the wheels, and I watered them down.
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine to haul my cotton come Picking Time, haul my cotton come Picking Time.
Last Sunday morning when they passed the hat it was still nearly empty back where I sat, but the preacher smiled and said that's fine.
The Lord'll wait til Picking Time, the Lord'll wait til Picking Time.

#The Man on the Hill

Will we get cold and hungry?
Will times be very bad?
When we're needing bread and meat, where we going to get it, Dad?
We'll get it from the man in the house on the hill.
Yes we will from the man on the hill.
Ploughing time is over.
Still the fields are bare.
How we going to make a living with twenty acres to share?
I'll beg for more land from the man on the hill.
Yes I will.
I'll ask the man on the hill.
I ain't got no Sunday shoes that I can wear to town.
Papa reckon the boss has got a pair of hand-me-downs.
I'll go and ask the man in the house on the hill.
Yes I will.
I'll ask the man on the hill.
Maybe he will help us.
Maybe we'll get by.
But who's going to pay the dying bills, if we all should die.
We'll leave it to the man in the sky when we die.
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky.

#Five Feet High and Rising

My mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our faith in the Lord.
We couldn't see much good in the flood waters when they were causing us to have to leave home, but when the water went down, we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land. 
The following year we had the best cotton crop we'd ever had.
I remember hearing: How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising.
How high's the water, papa? 
Two feet high and rising.
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat?
That's the only thing we got left that'll float.
It's already over all the wheat and the oats, two feet high and rising.
How high's the water, mama? 
Three feet high and rising.
How high's the water, papa? 
Three feet high and rising.
Well, the hives are goneg. 
I've lost my bees.
The chickens are sleeping in the willow trees.
Cow's in water up past her knees.
Three feet high and rising.
How high's the water, mama? 
Four feet high and rising.
How high's the water, papa? 
Four feet high and rising.
Hey, come look through the window pane.
The bus is coming.
Going to take us to the train.
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain, four feet high and rising.
How high's the water, mama? 
Five feet high and rising.
How high's the water, papa? 
Five feet high and rising.
Well, the rails are washed out north of town.
We got to head for higher ground.
We can't come back till the water comes down, five feet high and rising.
Well, it's five feet high and rising.

#Tennessee Flat-Top Box

In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town, sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around. 
And all the girls from there to Austin, were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock to take the trip, to go and listen, to the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat-top box. 
And he would play.
Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime, but give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: "Don't stop."
And hypnotized and fascinated, by the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat-top box.
And he would play.
Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him around.
He'd vanished like the breeze.
They forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him and hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade, was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat-top box.
And he would play.

#I Will Rock and Roll with You

They used to call me Rockabilly.
All of us ran through when Elvis opened up the door with a pup-and-pup-and-boo.
I didn't ever play much rock and roll because I got so much country in my soul.
But I'm a different man for loving you, and I take a shot at what you ask me to.
And baby I will rock and roll with you if I have to.
Memphis 1955 on Newton Avenue Carl and Jerry and Charlie and Roy and Billy Riley too.
A new sun rising on the way we sing and a world of weirdos waiting in the wings.
But I love you, and though I'm past 42, there are still a few things yet I didn't do.
And baby I will rock and roll with you if I have to.

#Frankie's Man, Johnny

Well now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts.
They were true as a blue blue sky.
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wandering eye, but he was her man nearly all of the time.
Well Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back.
He said he had a little picking to do a little farther down the track.
He said I'm your man. 
I wouldn't do you wrong.
Well Frankie curled up on the sofa thinking about her man.
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band.
He was Frankie's man he wasn't doing her wrong.
Then in the front door walked a redhead.
Johnny saw her right away.
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played.
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away.
He sang every song to the redhead.
She smiled back at him.
Then he came and sat at her table, where the lights were low and dim.
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none.
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him.
She slapped him a time or two.
She said I'm Frankie's sister, and I was checking up on you.
If you're her man, you better treat her right.
Well the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick.
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick.
He was Frankie's man, and he still ain't done her wrong.
 
#Who's Gene Autry

Whoopi tai ai oh, rocking to and fro, back in the saddle again.
My little boy said, "Daddy, who's Gene Autry?"
His old movie was coming on TV, and I said, "Let me tell you about him, son," and I took him upon my knee.
Why, when I was a little boy about your size and just about every Saturday night when I could scrape up a dime for the movies and when my Daddy said alright, I'd be right downtown at the picture show like everybody else that could to see a handsome man on a big fine stallion going about, doing good.
Singing: rocking to and fro.
Put him back in the saddle again.
let him go on his way.
Back in the saddle again.
Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar and sing all at the same time.
And I was riding right along there beside him on that broomstick pony of mine.
And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets when the bad guys had to be stopped.
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood but the bad guys dropped when he shot.
Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice and goodness and purity.
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy he made the world look better to me.
Singing: rocking to and fro.
Put him back in the saddle again.
let him go on his way.
Back in the saddle again.
And you know the way he rescued the rancher's daughter, he'd sent a thrill right up the aisle.
And the ending would always send us home with a good victorious smile.
Now you ask me: Who's Gene Autry?
Well, son, go ahead and watch the show.
And then ride off into the sunset with him like I did forty years ago.
Singing: rocking to and fro.
Put him back in the saddle again.
let him go on his way.
Back in the saddle again.

#Tears in the Holston River

On October Twenty Third, Nineteen Seventy Eight, I lost a loved one and I confess I cried in the joyous celebration of the lady and her music.
There were tears in the Holston River when Maybelle Carter died.
Then walking down that river road I saw crystal tear-shaped droplets, silver beads of love sparkling on the river side.
And I'll just bet they turn to diamonds, for the love that was behind them. 
There were tears in the Holston River when Mother Maybelle died.
Then on January Eighth, Nineteen-Seventy-Nine, we lost Sara Carter, and the pain was multiplied. 
Down below that old Clinch Mountain, we laid her at Mount Vernon. 
There were tears in the Holston River when Sara Carter died. 
Then walking down that river road I saw crystal tear-shaped droplets, silver beads of love sparkling in the riverside.
And I'll just bet they turn to diamonds, for the love that was behind them.
There were tears in the Holston River when Maybelle & Sara died. 
There were tears in the Holston River when Mother Maybelle and Sara Carter died.
