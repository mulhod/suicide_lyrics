Isn't It a Pity

Isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a shame how we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain, how we take each other's love without thinking anymore, forgetting to give back?
Isn't it a pity?
Some things take so long, but how do i explain when not too many people can see we're all the same and because of all their tears your eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them?
Now, isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a pity, oh, oh?
Now, isn't is a shame how we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain, how we take each other's love without thinking anymore, forgetting to give back?
Now, isn't it a pity?

#All Things Must Pass

Sunrise doesn't last all morning.
A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning.
It's not always going to be this grey.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.
Sunset doesn't last all evening.
A mind can blow those clouds away.
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving.
It's not always going to be this grey.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.
All things must pass.
None of life's strings can last, so I must be on my way and face another day.
Now the darkness only stays the nighttime.
In the morning it will fade away.
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time.
It's not always going to be this grey.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.
All things must pass.
All things must pass away.

#Art of Dying

There'll come a time when all of us must leave here .
Then nothing Sister Mary can do will keep me here with you as nothing in this life that I've been trying. could equal or surpass the art of dying.
Do you believe me? 
There'll come a time when all your hopes are fading, when things that seemed so very plain become an awful. pain, searching for the truth among the lying and answered when you've learned the art of dying.
But you're still with me, but if you want it, then you must find it .
But when you have it, there'll be no need for it .
There'll come a time when most of us return here, brought back by our desire to be a perfect entity, living through a million years of crying until you've realized the art of dying.
Do you believe me?

#The Light That Has Lighted the World

I've heard how some people have said that I've changed, that I'm not what I was, how it really is a shame.
The thoughts in their heads manifest on their brow, like bad scars from ill feelings they themselves arouse.
So hateful of anyone that is happy or free, they live all their lives without looking to see the light that has lighted the world.
It's funny how people just won't accept change as if nature itself they'd prefer re-arranged.
So hard to move on when you're down in a hole, where there's so little chance to experience soul.
I'm greatful to anyone that is happy or free for giving me hope while I'm looking to see the light that has lighted the world.

they said, I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace.
We've been expecting you.
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace.
No matter where you roam, know our love is true.

Your pain is now through.
Please forget those teardrops.
Let me take them from you.

#Let It Down

Though you sit in another chair, I can feel you here.
Looking like I don't care, but I do, I do.
Hiding it all behind anything I see should someone be looking at me.
While I occupy my mind, I can feel you here.
Love to us is so well-timed and I do, I do.
Wasting away these moments so heavenly should someone be looking at me.
Let it down.
let it all down.
Let your hair hang all around me.
Let it down.
let it down.
Let your love flow and astound me.
While you look so sweetly and divine, I can feel you here.
I see your eyes are busy kissing mine and I do, I do.

#Run of the Mill

Everyone has choice when to and not to raise their voices.
It's you that decides.
Which way will you turn while feeling that our love's not your concern?
It's you that decides.
No one around you will carry the blame for you.
No one around you will love you today and throw it all away tomorrow when you rise, another day for you to realize me or send me down again.
As the days stand up on end, you've got me wondering how I lost your friendship, but I see it in your eyes.
Though I'm beside you, I can't carry the lame for you.
I may decide to get out with your blessing, where I'll carry on guessing.
How high will you leap?
Will you make enough for you to reap it?
Only you'll arrive at your own made end with no one but yourself to be offended.
It's you that decides.

#Beware of Darkness

Watch out now, take care.
Beware of falling swingers, dropping all around you, the pain that often mingles in your fingertips.
Beware of darkness.
Watch out now, take care.
Beware of the thoughts that linger, winding up inside your head, the hopelessness around you in the dead of night.
Beware of sadness.
It can hit you.
It can hurt you, make you sore and, what is more, that is not what you are here for.
Watch out now, take care.
Beware of soft shoe-shufflers, dancing down the sidewalks as each unconscious sufferer wanders aimlessly.
Beware of Maya.
Watch out now, take care.
Beware of greedy leaders.
They take you where you should not go while Weeping Atlas Cedars, they just want to grow, grow, and grow.
Beware of darkness.

#Awaiting on You All

You don't need no love-in, you don't need no bedpan, you don't need a horoscope or a microscope to see the mess that you're in.
If you open up your heart, you will know what I mean.
We've been polluted so long.
Now here's a way for you to get clean: by chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free.
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see.
Chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free.
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see.
You don't need no passport and you don't need no visas, you don't need to designate or to emigrate before you can see Jesus.
If you open up your heart, you'll see he's right there, always was and will be.
He'll relieve you of your cares.
By chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free.
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see.
Chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free.
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see.
You don't need no church-house and you don't need no Temple, you don't need no rosary beads or them books to read to see that you have fallen.
If you open up your heart, you will know what I mean.
We've been kept down so long.
Someone's thinking that we're all green.
And, while the Pope owns 51% of General Motors and the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us, the lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see.
By chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free.

#Hear Me Lord

Forgive me, lord, please, those years when I ignored you.
Forgive them, lord, those that feel they can't afford you.
Help me, lord, please, to rise above this dealing.
Help me, lord, please, to love you with more feeling.
At both ends of the road, to the left and the right, above and below us, out and in, there's no place that you're not in.
Oh, won't you hear me, lord, Hear me, lord, Hear me, lord, Hear me, lord, Hear me, lord?
At both ends of the road, to the left and the right, above and below us, out and in, there's no place that you're not in.

#The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)

The Lord loves the one that loves the Lord and the law says, if you don't give, then you don't get loving.
Now, the Lord helps those that help themselves and the law says whatever you do is going to come right back on you.
We all making out like we own this whole world while the leaders of nations, they're acting like big girls with no thoughts for their God, who provides us with all.
But, when death comes to claim them, who will stand and who will fall?
The Lord loves the one that loves the Lord and the law says, if you don't give, then you don't get loving.
Now, the Lord helps those that help themselves and the law says whatever you do is going to come right back on you.
We all move around with objectives in mind to become rich or famous with our reputations signed, but the few that can reach to this coveted slot don't escape old age creeping through their bodies, like a rot.
While the Lord loves the one that loves the Lord and the law says, if you don't give, then you don't get loving, now, the Lord helps those that help themselves and the law says whatever you do is going to come right back on you.

#Be Here Now

Remember now.
Be Here Now as it's not like it was before.
The past was.
Be Here Now as it's not like it was before.
it was.
Why try to live a life that isn't real nohow?
A mind that wants to wander around a corner is an unwise mind.
Now Is.
Be Here Now as it's not what it was before.
Remember Now.
Be Here Now as it's not like it was before.
it was.

#Dark Horse

You thought that you knew where I was and when, but it looks like they've been fooling you again.
You thought that you'd got me all staked out, but, baby, looks like I've been breaking out.
I'm a dark horse running on a dark race-course.
I'm a blue moon since I stepped from out of the womb.
I've been a cool jerk looking for the source.
I'm a dark horse.
You thought you had got me in your grip.
Baby, looks like you was not so smart.
And I became too slippery for you, but let me say that was nothing new.
I'm a dark horse running on a dark race course.
I'm a blue moon since I picked up my first spoon.
I've been a cool jerk looking for the source.
I'm a dark horse.
I thought that you knew it all along until you started getting me not right.
Seems as if you heard a little late, but I warned you when we both were at the starting gate.
I'm a dark horse tunning on a dark race-course.
I'm a blue moon since I stepped from out of the womb.
I've been a cool jerk cooking at the source.
I'm a dark horse.

#Tired of Midnight Blues

The sun came into view as I sat with the tears in my eyes.
The sun came up on you and, as you smiled, the teardrop, it dried.
I don't know where I had been, but I know what I have seen.
Made me chill right to the bone.
Made me wish that I'd stayed home along with you.
Tired of midnight blues.
The sun came up so high and, as it shone, I realized your love.
The sun shone in your eyes and, as you smiled, you realized it, too.
Don't know where I had been, but I know what I have seen.
Made me chill right to the bone.
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you.
Tired of midnight blues.
Don't know where I had been, but I know what I have seen.
Made me chill right to the bone.
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you.
Tired of midnight blues.
The sun went down the sky
Way up the clouds told me that they knew, the moon came up so high, and, as you smiled, I knew that you knew, too.
Don't know where I had been, but I know what I have seen.
Made me chill right to the bone.
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you.
Tired of midnight blues.
I don't know where I had been, but I know what I have seen.
Made me chill right to the bone.
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you.

#This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying)

Found myself out on a limb, but I'm happier than I've ever been, but this guitar can't keep from crying.
Learned to get up when I fall, can even climb Rolling Stone walls, but this guitar can't keep from crying.
This here guitar can feel quite sad, can be high-strung, sometimes gets mad, can't understand or deal with hate, responds much better to love.
I thought by now you knew the score, but you missed the point just like before and this guitar can't keep from crying.
This guitar, it can't keep from crying.
This guitar can't keep from crying.
This here guitar can feel quite sad, can be high-strung, sometimes gets mad.
It can't understand or deal with hate, responds much better to love.
While you attack, create offense, I'll put it down to your ignorance, but this guitar, it can't keep from crying.
This guitar can't keep from crying.
This guitar can't keep from crying.
This guitar can't keep from crying.

#World of Stone

Wise man you won't be to follow the like of me in this world made of stone, such a long way to go.
We may disagree.
We all have the right to be in this world made of stone, such a long way to go, such a long, long way from home.
And we may disagree.
We all have the right to be in this world made out of stone.
It's such a long, long way to go.
The wiser you may be, the harder it can be to see in this world made of stone, such a long, long way to go, such a long way from home, in this world made of stone, such a long, long way to go and such a long way from home.
