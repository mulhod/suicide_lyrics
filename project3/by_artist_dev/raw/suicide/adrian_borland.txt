#Dreamfuel

Coming in and out of view, you don't, you don't cross that line.
Gliding in and out of my life, you don't, you don't cross that line.
I wish I'd met you long ago, when eyes of coal and skin of snow would have drawn from me a promise to defend.
I wish I'd met you way back when before our lives got tangled in machinery.
We've lost the will to bend, and we must remain dreamfuel.
Yes, you must remain dreamfuel, and I must remain dreamfuel.
When I think of you, can you hear me?


#Bright White Light

In between the messages, there's a stabbing at the numb.
A subliminal emptiness that flickers off and on.
You say you saw the very thing, and you wonder what it meant.
It was a bright white light.
The sun doesn't shine here.
It just signifies the day.
We take this life for granted, and we throw this world away.
Using up the good things until we wonder where they went, but there's a bright white light.  
At the heart of destruction lies the soul of discontent.
And a bright white light will blind you in the end.
These times are getting stranger.
I guess the angels must be here.
Our minds have started cracking as the picture's coming clear.
Some say they've left their bodies, and then seen that heaven sent a bright white light.


#When Can I Be Me

There's always this struggle to find my tongue.
This silence mistaken for consent by everyone.
And there's always this aching, and there's always this need.
Every road I'll be taking cursed by fallen trees.
When can I be me, she asks.
When can I be me?
This whole world takes my hand, brings me down to its level, and demands who I should be.
Who I should be.
Your kisses blind me.
I drown in your sin.
It will be six years before I see the box I'm in.
Then the rules of engagement will be forgotten in the war.
I see this relationship as it sinks beneath the floor.
I'm underneath you.
Two distant eyes, my fire suffocated, my desire compromised.
So far underneath you, dead in your arms, you still hear me breathing.
My instinctive charms.
But when can I be me?


#Cinematic

It's been a hundred years, so many wild scenes.
There must have been a thousand tears spilt on the way.
But it's all been so much fun, with the stars from the machine.
They brought you night in the middle of the day, but no one can see the film that you are in.
And they won't pay the price to come in to your cinematic life.
Yes, I understand.
Hey no. 
I really do.
When you smile and say you're never coming back because it's all been too much fun just to sit in the dark alone,
There were times it took the worries off your back.
But no-one can see the film that you star in, and they won't pay the price to come in to your cinematic life.
Feels like I've known you for a hundred years.
So many wild scenes.
There must have been a thousand tears spilt on the way.
But it's all been so much fun from the screen kiss to the gun.
We aimed at everyone who blocked our way.
And no-one can see the film that we've been in.
From the cutting room floor, then it's straight into the bin with this cinematic life.


#Night Cascade

The dusk arrives, the labor done.
As the falling of the sun brings the night cascade from the buzzing city air to the bells in some town square.
Hear the night cascade.
Magnetic to the life that calls, you step beyond your stifling walls into the night cascade.
Here's the answer to the prayer.
Here's the light that's always there.
Oh, the night cascade to blow away the dying day.
It's descending from above.
It's the backdrop for your love.
Oh, the night cascade, a flag of stars for the life we've made.
Sodium shines off the cement, competing with the firmament in the night cascade.
But we're ignited from within, like a catherine wheel we'll spin through the night cascade.
I picked you up.
I'll lay you down.
And crashing slowly to the ground, we are the night cascade.
Here's the answer to the prayer.
Here's the light that's always there.
Oh, the night cascade to blow away the dying day.
It's descending from above.
It's the backdrop for our love.
Oh, the night cascade, a flag of stars for the love we made.


#Neon and Stone

I hear the laughter from another life.
The night is young for someone, but to me it's as old as October's leaves.
God don't bring on the winter please.
Can't you see my broken city heart?
I'm by the side of this thoroughfare, this concrete promise that leads nowhere, lit by neon, framed by stone.
I'm the question on your journey home.
Can't you see my broken city heart?
Star of wonder, star of light, I don't see you in my cut of sky.
Just the fumes, the haze, the canopy.
This world is drawing over me.


#Long Dark Train

This long dark train, for years it's rolled.
We cry in vain.
The doors stay closed.
Driven for the few by sleight of hand, it runs the length of this shattered land.
But soon the chance will come, the chance to leave this train.
And don't forget, don't forget, no, no, to never come this way again.
Death on the tracks.
It rattles down past silent yards, through ghostly towns, past disused towers.
It powers by.
It runs on time.
It runs on lies.
I think I hear the scream of brakes, and just up ahead the buffers wait.
The terminal for this long dark train.


#Western Veil

Shadows of doubt form like dark skies.
Here's where the love waits.
Here's where the love hides.
It's like I see you for the first time.
I hear heaven call.
You take me behind your deep sea green eyes.
How far will I fall?
Her arms were open, but now she's met them all.
Only truth can tear down that wall.
And you are taking down the signs that say: I'm closed. 
Don't look.
Don't touch.
Okay?
Broken promise, shattered vows.
Her only solace is that she's stronger now.
She's stronger now.


#We Are the Night

We were born in the barren day.
Grew in the city like wild flowers between the concrete and through the clay.
We saw a love and made it ours.
You take me to my dreams.
We leave the world behind.
It's never understood how we are the night.
We're the life they'll never choose.
We're the road they must refuse.
We're the colors they'll never see.
We're the moon and the stars, the moon and the stars.
We are the night.


#I Can't Stop the World

You know the summer's gone when the wind hits your face.
And you feel you don't belong in such a god-forsaken place.
You try to beat the cold, but the world won't be controlled.
And the time rushes on, and the future's yesterday.
Though you'll never see twenty-three again.
The truth is cruel but plain: it's a world you can't contain.
And the sky's matt black tonight, but the day will paint it blue.
And the sun will scale the heights, but it won't shine down on you.
And if I could stop the world I would, Or if I could freeze the time where it stood, but there's nothing I can do to stay with you.
When all you've held high, is lowered like a flag you can't salute, and every dream you've had is gone, it's a world that's moving on.
When the signs are clear to see, will you look the other way?
Will it bring you to your knees?
Will you feel the need to pray?
Whatever you believe in, it's a world you'll be leaving.


#Heading Emotional South

I know this sinking feeling, that salt water sting.
The bottom line, I'm underneath it, I hang on every word that you say.
And in an icy wind I sway.
If this is your mind you seldom speak it.
With words as cold as history falling from your precious mouth.
I don't need to hear what you need to say to be heading emotional south.
I'm sliding down your wall into the gutter where love gets down and crawls, among the promises that lie there broken.
Hey, does it hurt to see the damage done so recklessly by all the hollow lines you've spoken?
With words as cold as history falling from your precious mouth.
I don't need to hear what you need to say.
I'm heading emotional south anyway.
All my love in vain.


#Spanish Hotel

In your room, stuck in a heat, as if the power of the sun was all being spent in one noon.
You woke with your head the wrong end of the bed.
You stare at the phone as it rings, but right now two yards is two yards too far for you, and you feel the summer burning little holes in every sense that you've got, and you've seen the ceiling turning on a dark ride that won't let you off.
In your room, high above the streets, your patience is stretched, snap taut as a drum.
Soon don't mean soon, it just slips off her tongue, and the waiting makes statues that crack when she comes, and you shake. 
You need her to come, and you feel something burning.
It's your dignity.
It's seen how far you can fall and you feel, the hours turning into centuries full of nothing at all.
In your room, alone on the sheets, skin so pale it glows opaque in the night.
Dawn will soon come, the darkness be gone, along with the crutches it takes to feel strong.
Still your fear will be dragged into the light, and deep down inside you are burning with the hatred of what you've become, and you fear that you're turning into something instead of someone.
Room 83, it's the one you never leave.
It's a little piece of hell, your Spanish hotel.


#The March

We march through our lives so sure, keeping all of our doubts behind closed doors, wishing that light would conquer those walls.
And it's never too late to see that we may have been so wrong before.
And now we can face our faults.
"There's no time like now," I said.
Should have said it to myself.
"There's no time like now" I said, but I should have said it to myself.
It's never too late to see the path you've taken has caused you're life to be far from your heart. 
Lost in the cold.
And we are such a curious blend of weakness and strength.
The tears of the tallest men will fall at the smallest hint of soul.
 
#Solar

My mother said I didn't smile until I saw the rays between the leaves.
They fell with my birthdate, early December.
I don't celebrate until the summer.
Solar, I don't work in the winter.
I uncoil in the spring time.
I'm all over the summer.
Solar, solar, solar, solar.
And every year I end this hibernation.
Take the usual trains to new destinations to be born again, dragged toward the light.
I feel that way every August day when I throw the windows wide.
Solar, I don't work in the winter.
I uncoil in the spring time.
I'm all over the summer.
Solar, solar, solar, solar.


#Angel Sulk

She sees the dying of the light.
She sees the creeping crooked night.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
She sees the squandering of the time, the stuff that's on your hands and mine.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
She sees a street turned cold and mean, still she doesn't intervene.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
Electronic eye on you, it took the work she used to do.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
Fixing our stare on the falling sun.
Wondering where on earth the day has gone.
It was our chance, a grace we'd won, but waste it is all we've done.
She hears the soulless surface sound.
So much good gone underground.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
She sees through these walls and floors, straight into my heart and yours.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
Fixing our stare on the falling sun, wondering where on earth the day has gone.
It was our chance, a grace we'd won, but waste it is all we've done.
Have you seen my angel sulk?
Have you seen my angel sulk?
Have you seen my angel sulk?


#Forever from Here

Took a walk, looked around, found the tallest hill to climb.
On the crest I took a breath of air not shared a million times.
All my head, it felt so light.
All my burdens fell away.
I was closer to the brilliant blue with nothing concrete in the way.
You can see forever from here.
You can see forever.
As I lay on the grass, the speed of life began to slow.
As the day it drifted past, the sky acquired a luminous glow.
Everything that bothered me was left so far behind.
All my tangled mess of thoughts unravelled in my mind.
And you can see forever from here.
You can see forever.
And there's you by my side.
We survived those scenes.
And with you I feel alright.
Won't forget how much that means.
So blow another bubble, and watch how far it goes.
All that worldly trouble is miles and miles below.
You can see forever from here.
You can see forever from here.
You can see forever from here.
You can see forever.


# Scrapyard

Fluorescent strip, it buzzes off and on, but everything goes wrong in this scrapyard.
You say you care. 
Well you did for a minute, while you could afford it in this scrapyard.
Your conscience could never compete with the lure of the street that runs through this scrapyard.
This city doesn't sleep, and the 24 keep crawling around the clockface in this scrapyard.
Fast food, fast art, in with a bullet, and out with the sewerage in this scrapyard.
All the lines from far away towns lead to this dumping ground because the city is a scrapyard.
Who's that you ask, but it's yourself in the glass.
My how it's changed, you in this scrapyard.
You flick your ash, talk a mountain of trash, and sleep through a car crash, in this scrapyard.
Are you sick or well? 
It's getting harder to tell.
You get immune to the smell of this scrapyard.
So stay clean tonight because the cemeteries never close, and any junkie of a fool knows the city is a scrapyard. 


#Startime

A potent elixir, it drips from the stars onto the strip where the rain hits the cars.
A strange curse descending on anyone it can find.
The chosen, the stolen startime, startime.
Tugging inside me, inseparable twin drags me to places the sun's never been.
Says I must taste everything by chance or design.
He's always demanding startime, startime.
Suddenly grey and blue take on another hue.
Watching life's dream film I press my face close to make sense of one thing before it all goes.
So now I surrender before I resign.
Be sure I'll have had my startime, startime, startime, startime.


#Summer Wheels

Dream yourself to that shore.
Put yourself on that flight.
Bare feet in a box of sand, in your head a song of light.
Oh, you've not long to wait to know exactly how it feels.
You've not long to wait.
Here come your summer wheels.
When days slow to a crawl, all fireworks in the rain, bear in mind that the worst is behind you, and feel alive again.
Oh, you've not long to wait to know exactly how it feels.
You've not long to wait.
Here come your summer wheels.
Stuck in a room with no view, watching the wallpaper peel.
you can still make good your escape when your case comes up for appeal.
Dream yourself to that shore.
Visualise that flight.
Bare feet in a box of sand, in your head a song of light.
You've got to get out of yourself.
It's so long overdue.
Time to uncover a world and find it thinks the world of you.
Oh, you've not long to wait to know exactly how it feels.
You've not long to wait.
Here come your summer wheels.
Your summer wheels.
Your summer wheels.
Here come your summer wheels.
Don't go too long without light.
Don't go too long without love.
Don't go too long without light.
Don't go too long without love.
Here come your summer wheels.


#Destiny Stopped Screaming

Lay me on my back.
Take a compress to my fever.
Stop the walls from talking back.
Tell destiny stop screaming.
All directions in my head have left me staring at the ceiling.
To my own calling am I deaf.
To destiny still screaming?
And all the doubts have left their mark on me, like all the barbs that snag the edge of sleep.
Now all I ask is what did you want from me?
What did you want from me?
The hours line the day, and they point me to the evening.
Cold as killers by the way.
Dark as destiny still screaming.
At the crossroad's once again, intent on following a feeling.
Somehow, someway I will know when, when destiny's stopped screaming.
And all the doubts have left their mark on me like all the barbs that snag the edge of sleep.
Now all I ask is what did you want from me?
What did you want from me?
What did you want from me?
Oh, is that destiny still screaming? 
Oh, is that destiny?
When the bells are rung for me and I am done with breathing, fold my arms in front of me and whisper Destiny's stopped screaming?


#Get Me a Witness

Get me a witness for I cannot believe that there's so much forgiveness that we cannot retrieve.
Are we losing it?
Are we losing it?
Come down, save your life.
Come down, save your life.
Get me a witness for the things I've seen.
Every day slipping further from the way it might have been.
Are we losing it?
Are we losing it?`
Come down, save your life. 
Come down, save your life.
Come down, save your life.
Come through for your life.
Get me a witness.
Down here near enough, so much is dependent on the strength of your love.
Are we losing it?
Are we losing it?
Are we losing it?


#In the Field

In the field, eyes make strange exchanges.
In the field, dreams find life and form.
In the field, silent codes are broken.
In the field, love's the law.
Nothing done in love and trust can be wrong, and nothing done without them can be right.
In the field, an empire of the senses.
In the field, feel no shame at all.
In the field, we run wild like fire.
In the field, love's the law.
Nothing done in love and trust can be wrong, and nothing done without them can be right.
Open my eyes I see you running.
Open my arms I feel you coming.
Open my heart I feel you wanting.
Open my dreams I feel you haunting.
Open my head I feel you needing.
Open my mouth this is love we're feeling?
Open my eyes I see you coming.
Open my heart I see you running.
Running in the field.
Free in the field.
Running in the field.


#Heart Goes Down Like the Sun

Nothing can reach me.
No colour no sound can touch me or stir me or turn me around.
I'm shut up shop.
Shutters slide to the ground.
No one will know how low I've come down.
Though I'm blind I still feel the night descend.
Though I'm dumb I still speak its tongue.
Though I'm stone I know when the cold kicks in, and a heart goes down like the sun.
All my fear under veils of resistance, all my fire a pale ashen glow, but it's all in perspective a comfortable distance, all my rain turned to soft numbing snow.
Though I'm blind I still feel the night descend.
Though I'm dumb I still speak its tongue.
Though I'm stone I know when the cold kicks in, and a heart goes down like the sun.
Dead weight inside me is sinking slowly, tied to my feelings and all that I know.
I'm moved about by a magnet below me.
My leaden feet don't care where they go.
I know I'm not the only one whose heart goes down like the sun.
Though I'm blind I still feel the night descend.
Though I'm dumb I still speak its tongue.
Though I'm stone I know when the cold kicks in, and a heart goes down like the sun.


#Land Meets Ocean

I looked out from derelict stations, precarious perches, cliff top views.
I couldn't hear past your conversation.
I couldn't see beyond your blue.
My hope was high with intoxication.
Your invitation was coming through.
I closed my eyes and I felt the sheer drop, and it led me to you.
I am crumbling into your sea.
I am drowning so sweetly.
Now my lungs are filled with your love.
I've grown the fins I knew I'd need.
When I worked out that you weren't coming, and the flood I'd willed would never be.
From one of questions to part of the reason the transformation made by you.
I closed my eyes.
I did the one thing I'd never dared do.
I am crumbling into your sea.
I am drowning so sweetly.
Land meets ocean it's an old, old story.
It's an ancient tale everybody knows.


#Song Damn Song

What drives these confessions? 
What kind of reward?
The need to be noticed, condemned or adored.
Revealing your feelings and innermost thoughts in a song damn song.
Purity comes with its own complications.
Trawling for truth's a high risk occupation.
You can end up a wreck on prescribed medication.
Song damn song.
You pour it all out, but it's burning like acid, scarring the hearts of the ones who once trusted you.
Was better off left in that box in your attic.
Song damn song.
The dark stuff will take on a life of its own, turn like a monster and tear up your home life.
And you'll be to blame for the seed that's been sown in a song damn song.
Your sad little masterpiece hurts you to strum it.
It ruins your life when the world got to hum it.
You're forced to repeat it until you become it.
Song damn song.
It feels like a pit but you're told its the summit of song damn song. 


#Last Train out of Shatterville

Face cracks in the morning sun, ageing thirty eight days in one with no recall of half of all the stupid, drunken things I've done.
I sunk until it made me ill.
Tequila smile meet whisky kiss.
The last train out of Shatterville is one I can't afford to miss.
All the way from making sense to the floor of some bar.
I have gone the distance, yes, it really isn't very far.
When you've seen enough chances rushing past, and you wish you could stop falling, then the last train out of Shatterville it's calling, it's calling, it's calling.
Now I don't want to fill this room with what I've got to say to you.
What gives me the right to speak?
I stayed too long myself it's true, but I saw you on the street last dawn as you slid from kerb to bonnet.
When that train pulls out in the cold morning light, just be on it. 


#Living on the Edge of God

trip me down, expose the man.
Not a pretty sight in morning light.
And in the mirror these two eyes, well they're all I have left to look into.
The blackened lip, the troubled night.
I saw off the demons deep inside.
Oh but slumped here in despair and wine give me something to surrender to.
Keep me living on the edge of God.
Think it's not enough for us?
We need to see the soul and the guts.
Oh that fear that beats us, the fear that cheats us out of our true happiness.
Oh a crazy voice, the cracks in the machine, it's turned down in you; it's so loud in me.
I'm like a broken radio.
I've been just drifting in and out of sense.
But keep me living on the edge of God.
I need a cult to beat the cull, but will this win down the road, or to take this life of its poverty, to bring your message home to me?
Keep me living on the edge of God.
