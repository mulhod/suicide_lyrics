will it bring you to you knee ? 
will you feel the need to pray ? 
whatever you believe in , it 's a world you 'll be leave .

you stare at the phone as it ring , but right now two yard be two yard too far for you , and you feel the summer burn little hole in every sense this you 've get , and you 've see the ceiling turn on a dark ride this wo n't let you off .
