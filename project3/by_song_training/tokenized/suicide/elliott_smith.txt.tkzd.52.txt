#little one

one more little one .
i 'll go down , stay down , sleep the rest of the day , dream new music to calm down , stay down and keep evil away .
i can hear you asleep changing your shape , dissolved in some dream as a new one appears to take you along where you 've never been .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
the moonlight tonight seems to belong to me because , even though some ca n't sleep , i need some company .
one hit would n't hurt a bit at all .
slow down , sleep.
what 's .
if it 's good shit , you wo n't know .
and i wo n't know the fact that i 'm dying if i seem to be reckless with myself .
it 's the fault of no one .
all things have a place under the moon as well as the sun .
one more little one .
i love you .
