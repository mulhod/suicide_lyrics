#that was the president

the bullets of the false revenge have struck us once again as the angry seas have struck upon the sand and it seemed as though a friendless world had lost itself a friend .
that was the president and that was the man .
i still can see him smiling there and waving at the crowd as he drove through the music of the band and never even knowing no more time would be allowed , not for the president and not for the man .
here 's a memory to share .
here 's a memory to save of the sudden early ending of command .
yet a part of you and a part of me is buried in his grave .
that was the president and that was the man .
it 's not only for the leader that the sorrow hits so hard .
there are greater things i 'll never understand .
how a man so filled with life , even death was caught off guard .
that was the president and that was the man .
everything he might have done and all he could have been was proven by the troubled traitor 's hand for what other death could wound the hearts of so many men ?
that was the president and that was the man .
yes , the glory that was lincoln 's never died when he was slain .
it 's been carried over time and time again and to the list of honor you may add another name .
that was the president and that was the man .
that was the president and that was the man .
on a south pacific ocean , on a south pacific shore , a legend was written on the sand for a man of peace was born in the middle of a war .
