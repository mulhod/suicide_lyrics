#talking to mary

talking to mary , you know you do n't have to shout .
she can hear what you 're thinking like you 're saying it right out loud .
she sees behind that dirty look .
it was her that followed down every stupid turn that you took .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
saw the one big problem you keep under your hat and it 's pretty unlikely that anybody else would be cool with that .
you got bus fare in your pocket and more money down in your sock , but she ca n't tell you how to contact her if you wo n't listen to her talk .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
it 's no problem .
i 'll just keep quiet if it 's easier for you to make believe in that i do n't love you as much as i do .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
one day she 'll go .
i told you so .
i told you so .
i told you so .
