# first timer

i 'm a first timer , wishing i was someone else when i see you by yourself in a corridor where you find yourself now blocked by a door you locked .
you wo n't do what the doctor ordered .
you wo n't see someone else .
come on back to me , my bright tomorrow .
you say you feel hollow and you know it 's because you are , well , at least so far .
i think of you with hesitation .
i think of you too hard .
come on back to me , but do n't make me sorry .
i 'm a first timer , wishing i 'd been someone else , seeing you by yourself , seeing you by yourself .
