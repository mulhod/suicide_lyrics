#drain you

one baby to another says , i 'm lucky to have met you .
i do n't care what you think unless it is about me .
it is now my duty to completely drain you , a travel through a tube , and end up in your infection .
chew your meat for you .
pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours .
i like you .
with eyes so dilated , i 've become your pupil .
you 've taught me everything without a poison apple .
the water is so yellow .
i 'm a healthy student , indebted and so grateful .
vacuum out the fluids .
chew your meat for you .
pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours .
i like you , you , you , you , you , you .

it is now my duty to completely drain you , a travel through a tube , and end up in your infection .
chew your meat for you .
pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours , sloppy lips to lips .
you 're my vitamins .
i 'm like you .
