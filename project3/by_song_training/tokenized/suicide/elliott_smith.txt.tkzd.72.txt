#fear city

dragged down into lowercase , trying to get your cops to talk right , but they ca n't put the paper in your face .
you 're just trying to walk by , so now i got a new game , baby .
no one 's going to recognize it , your broken english over their flat , tired remarks still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
i can do everything that your man does , except for better , got no interest now in undressing your kids .
with cheap angst love letters you write your name in all of the places no one goes .
some ca n't be satisfied until everybody knows .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
come on .
is n't it pretty ?
yeah .
i 'm going to see my city dead .
