#big long now

it 's not cold enough .
please put this side up .
she is moving through .
can we show our faces now ?
i 'm not interesting .
she 's not turning green , shameful as it seems .
can we show our faces now ?
endless climb .
i am blind .
why ca n't i leave ?
color-blind .
speaking a phrase .
instantly grown .
i am blind , waiting in line .
it 's not cold enough .
please put this side up .
she is moving through .
can we show our faces now ?
i 'm not interesting .
she 's not turning green , shameful as it seems .
can we show our faces now ?
endless climb .
i am blind .
why ca n't i leave ?
color-blind .
speaking a phrase .
instantly grown .
i am blind .
why am i sure ?
