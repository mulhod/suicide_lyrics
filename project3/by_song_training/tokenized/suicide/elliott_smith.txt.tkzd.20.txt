#alphabet town

alphabet city is haunted .
constantina feels right at home .
she probably wo n't say you 're wrong , but you 're already wrong , you 're already wrong , and you threw up whatever she shot down , said show me around this alphabet town , said show me around .
there 's a name you keep repeating .
you got nothing better to do and you 're with someone who 'll hear you say it and just not mind .
her hand on your arm , her hand on your arm , she put her hand on your arm and told you her name .
you ca n't pronounce it .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
i know what you are .
i just do n't mind .
i wo n't say you 're wrong .
i know what you want and it 's what i want .
so let 's go out .
i 'm ready to go out .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
i 'll show you around this alphabet town .
