#celia

when the wind from the island is rolling through the trees , when a kiss from a prison cell is carried in the breeze , that 's when i wonder how sad a man can be .
oh , when will celia come to me ?
i still remember the mountains of the war , sierra madre and the philipino shore .
when will i lie beside my celia beneath the trees ?
oh , when will celia come to me ?
so many years were stolen .
so many years are gone .
and the vision of my celia make dreams to dream upon .
each hour is a day filled with memories .
oh , when will celia come to me ?
i wake each morning and i watch the sun arise , wonder if my celia sleeps , wonder if she cries .
if hate must be my prison lock , love must be the key .
oh , when will celia come to me ?
the guns have stopped their firing .
you may wander through the hills .
they kept my celia through the war .
they keep her from me still .
she waits upon island now , a prisoner of the sea .
oh , when will celia come to me ?
when the wind from the island is rolling through the trees , when a kiss from a prison cell is carried in the breeze , that 's when i wonder how sad a man can be .
oh , when will celia come to me ?
oh , when will celia come to me ?
