#twenty four hours

so this is permanence , love 's shattered pride , what once was innocence turned on its side .
a cloud hangs over me , marks every move , deep in the memory of what once was love .
oh , how i realized !
how i wanted time !
put into perspective .
tried so hard to find .
just for one moment , thought i 'd found my way .
destiny unfolded .
i watched it slip away .
excessive flashpoints , beyond all reach .
solitary demands for all i 'd like to keep.
let 's take a ride out .
see what we can find .
a valueless collection of hopes and past desires .
i never realized the lengths i 'd have to go , all the darkest corners of a sense i did n't know .
just for one moment , i heard somebody call .
looked beyond the day in hand .
there 's nothing there at all .
now that i 've realized how it 's all gone wrong , got to find some therapy .
this treatment takes too long .
deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway , got to find my destiny before it gets too late .
