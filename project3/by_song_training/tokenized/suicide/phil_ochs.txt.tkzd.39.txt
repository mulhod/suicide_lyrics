#basket in the pool

went to a party the other night .
everybody was there .
thought that i would have some fun as i started up the stair .
somebody tried to ruin it when he won a raffle prize .
tried to shake and shock us right before our eyes .
while we danced , while we were dancing , who was the fool throw the basket in the pool ?
it was filled with the finest cheeses , filled with imported wine .
wish that i had won it and i wish that it were mine .
i know some wino lives outside of town who would gladly cut your throat if he could drink it down .
while we danced , while we were dancing , who was the fool throw the basket in the pool ?
if i had found out who he was , if i 'd have found his face , next time we have a party going to find out his name .
i 've been on the ocean swimming .
know porpoise led the way .
it was n't worth the matter and it was n't worth the pay .
we were there , go right on dancing .
who was the fool throw the basket in the pool ?
how can i go swimming now ?
my world is laid to waste .
it was the worst of manners and it was the worst of taste .
why ca n't we be left alone ?
think that it was a crime .
if everyone was groovy , we could all have a real good time .
we could dance , go right on dancing .
who was the fool throw the basket in the pool ?
