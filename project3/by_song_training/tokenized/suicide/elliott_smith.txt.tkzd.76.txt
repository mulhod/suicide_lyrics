#see you later

i got a choke-chain made out of night-rain to keep your memory down in quicksand from the main man , to drown everything out .
we were out on a joyride , fucked up from insides , always at a dead stall from sticking pins into miniature men who ca n't feel it at all .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
walk through thick mud looking for new blood , thinking i heard your name , cruel imagination still giving you pain just to find you with your master-minder running your affairs , saying how your better now since it killed all your other cares .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
see you later if i see you at all .
see you later .
