#going down to mississippi

i 'm going down to mississippi .
i 'm going down a southern road and , if you never see me again , remember that i had to go , remember that i had to go .
it 's a long road down to mississippi .
it 's a short road back the other way .
if the cops pull you over to the side of the road , you wo n't have nothing to say .
no , you wo n't have nothing to say .
there 's a man waiting down in mississippi and he 's waiting with a rifle in his hand and he 's looking down the road for an out-of-state car and he thinks he 's fighting for his land .
yes , he thinks he 's fighting for his land .
and he wo n't know the clothes i 'm wearing and he does n't know the name that i own , but his gun is large and his hate is hard and he knows i 'm coming down the road .
yes , he knows i 'm coming down the road .
it 's not for the glory that i 'm leaving .
it 's not trouble that i 'm looking for .
but there 's lots of good work calling me down and the waiting wo n't do no more .
no , the waiting wo n't do no more .
do n't call me the brave one for going .
no , do n't pin a medal to my name for , even if there was any choice to make , i 'd be going down just the same , i 'd be going down just the same for someone 's got to go to mississippi just as sure as there 's a right and there 's a wrong .
even though you say the time will change , that time is just too long , that time is just too long .
so i 'm going down to mississippi .
i 'm going down a southern road and , if you never see me again , remember that i had to go , remember that i had to go .
