# no love lost

so long sitting her .
did n't hear the warning .
waiting for the tape to run .
we 've been moving around in different situations , knowing that the time would come , just to see you torn apart , witness to your empty heart .
i need it .
i need it .
i need it .
through the wire screen , the eyes of those standing outside looked in at her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo .
in the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument which they had that morning inserted deep into her body .
she shuddered instinctively .
no life at all in the house of dolls .
no love lost .
no love lost .
you 've been seeing things in darkness , not in learning , hoping that the truth will pass .
no life underground .
wasting .
never changing .
wishing that this day wo n't last .
to never see you show your age , to watch until the beauty fades , i need it .
i need it .
i need it .
