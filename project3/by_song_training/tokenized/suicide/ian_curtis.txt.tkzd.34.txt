guess your dreams always end .
they do n't rise up , just descend .
but i do n't care anymore .
i 've lost the will to want more .
i 'm not afraid , not at all .
i watch them all as they fall , but i remember when we were young .
those with habits of waste , their sense of style and good taste , of making sure you were right .
hey , do n't you know you were right ?
i 'm not afraid anymore .
i keep my eyes on the door , but i remember .
tears of sadness for you , more upheaval for you reflects a moment in time , a special moment in time .
yeah , we wasted our time ,
we did n't really have time , but we remember when we were young .
and all god 's angels beware and all you judges beware .
sons of chance , take good care for all the people not there .
i 'm not afraid anymore .
i 'm not afraid anymore .
i 'm not afraid anymore .
oh , i 'm not afraid anymore .
