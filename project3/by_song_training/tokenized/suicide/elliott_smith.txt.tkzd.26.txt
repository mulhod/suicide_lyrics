#somebody that i used to know

i had tender feelings that you made hard , but it 's your heart , not mine , that 's scarred .
so when i go home , i 'll be happy to go .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
you do n't need my help anymore .
it 's all now to you , there be not no before , now that you 're big enough to run your own show .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
i watched you deal in a dying day and throw the living past away , so you can be sure that you 're in control .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
i know you do n't think you did me wrong and i ca n't stay this way for long , keeping ahold of what you just let go .
you 're just somebody that i used to know .
