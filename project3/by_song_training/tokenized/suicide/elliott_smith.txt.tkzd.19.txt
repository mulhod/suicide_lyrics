#satellite

while the hands are pointing up midnight , you 're a question mark coming after people you watched collide .
you can ask what you want to the satellite because the names you drop put ice in my veins .
and , for all you know , you 're the only one who finds it strange when they call it a lover 's moon , the satellite , because it acts just like lovers do .
the satellite , a burned out world you know staying up all night , the satellite .
