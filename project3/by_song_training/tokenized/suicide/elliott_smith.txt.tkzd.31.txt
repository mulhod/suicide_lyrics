#in the lost and found ( honky bach )

he held his breath to hold your hand , to walk the stairsteps in pairs , climbing up a slippery slope .
i 'm in love , love i hope .
do n't go home , angelina .
stay with me , hanging around in the lost and found .
kissed you quick , feeling weird , lonely , leered , and disappeared .
this is such a simple place passing time ca n't erase .
do n't go home , angelina .
paint tomorrow blue .
day breaks and every morning , when he wakes , he thinks of you .
i 'm alone .
that 's okay .
i do n't mind .
most of the time i do n't feel afraid to die .
she was here passing by .
do n't go home , angelina .
stay with me , hanging around in the lost and found .
stay with me , hanging around in the lost and found .
