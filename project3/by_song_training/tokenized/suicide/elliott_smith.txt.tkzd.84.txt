# no name # 4

for a change she got out before he hurt her bad , took her records and clothes and pictures of her boy .
it really made her sad .
packed it up and did n't look back .
i 'm okay , let 's just forget about him .
the car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine .
in her bag i saw things she drew when she was nine , like this one here , her alone , nobody near .
what a shame .
let 's just not talk about it .
no , it does n't look like you , but you did wear cowboy boots .
that 's your fame , there 's no question about it .
once we got back inside , with one ear to the ground i was ready to hide because i do n't know who 's around and you look scared .
it 's our secret .
do not tell , okay ?
let 's just not talk about it .
do n't tell , okay ?
let 's just forget all about it .
