#polly

polly wants a cracker .
i think i should get off her first .
i think she wants some water to put out the blow-torch .
it is n't me .
we have some seed .
let me clip your dirty wings .
let me take a ride .
do n't cut yourself .
i want some help to please myself .
i 've got some rope .
you have been told .
i promise you i have been true .
let me take a ride .
do n't cut yourself .
i want some help to please myself .
polly wants a cracker .
maybe she would like some food .
she asks me to untie her .
a chase would be nice for a few .
it is n't me .
we have some seed .
let me clip your dirty wings .
let me take a ride .
do n't cut yourself .
i want some help to please myself .
i 've got some rope .
you have been told .
i promise you i have been true .
let me take a ride .
do n't cut yourself .
i want some help to please myself .
polly said , polly says her back hurts and she 's just as bored as me .
she caught me off my guard .
it amazes me , the will of instinct .
it is n't me .
we have some seed .
let me clip your dirty wings .
let me take a ride .
do n't cut yourself .
i want some help to please myself .
i 've got some rope .
you have been told .
i promise you i have been true .
let me take a ride .
do n't cut yourself .
i want some help to please myself .
