#la

the gentleman 's in the lane spinning his hat on a cane , stepping out , out for a change .
good morning , all , it 's a beautiful day .
the general 's winning the war that seems suicidal before you came along .
now i 'll protect you as long as you 'll stay .
la morning had to come .
i 'd be walking in the sun , living in the day , but last night i was about to throw it all away .
if patience started a band , i 'd be her biggest fan .
look at me , i 'm talking to you .
i do n't want the lead in your play .
the star 's just a part of the scene , the gentleman in green paying off out on the street .
i ca n't go home .
it 's not on my way .
la things i 've never done , cars parked in the sun .
living in the day , but last night i was about to throw it all away .
last night i was about to throw it all away .
last night i was about to throw it all away .
last night i was about to throw it all away .
