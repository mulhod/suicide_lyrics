feel it closing in , feel it closing in , the fear of whom i call .
every time i call i feel it closing in .
i feel it closing in day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out .
i feel it closing in as patterns seem to form .
i feel it cold and warm .
the shadows start to fall .
i feel it closing in .
i feel it closing in day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out , day in , day out .
i 'd have the world around to see just whatever happens , stood by the door alone , and then it 's fade away .
i see you fade away .
do n't ever fade away .
i need you here today .
do n't ever fade away .
do n't ever fade away .
do n't ever fade away .
do n't ever fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away , fade away .
