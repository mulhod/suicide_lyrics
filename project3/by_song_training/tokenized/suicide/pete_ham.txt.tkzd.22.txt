#blodwyn

i put away the knife , the chisel , and the saw .
i 've locked away my life behind this old oak door to make a simple spoon , a token of my love in hope that maybe soon it 's me you 're thinking of .
so take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn .
the valley knows the way i feel today .
so take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon takes you away .
my life may not be long , was working down below for so much can go wrong , but what else do i know ?
so take these precious years and make them precious too and say you 'll take from me what i will give to you .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn .
the valley knows the way i feel today .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon takes you away .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn .
valley knows the way i feel today .
take my spoon , blodwyn .
make it soon , blodwyn , before some other spoon takes you away .
