# walk out in the rain

so i just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me .
and , if the rain should go away , then in my lonely room i 'll stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go away .
so i just live a life of hope , pretending that i could n't care , but , if you find you cannot cope , just call my name and i 'll be there .
if i could live my life again , i still relive those precious times .
although i know there would be pain , it felt so good while you were mine .
be mine .
be mine .
be mine .
be mine .
be mine .
so i just walk out in the rain , so i just walk out in the rain so that the clouds could hide the pain , so that the clouds could hide the pain and maybe you will never see and maybe you will never see the thousand tears you gave to me , thousand tears you gave .
and , if the rain should go away , and if the rain should go away , then in my lonely room i stay , then in my lonely room i stay so that the world will never know how much it hurts to see you go .
and , if you ever change your mind , you know , baby , you will find all my sorrow and my pain .
you 'll find me walking in the rain .
