#stupidity tries

got a foot in the door .
god knows what for !
and he 'll cut me down to size .
stupidity tries .
everything here is free , everything but you and me .
this painting never dries .
stupidity tries .
savannah shoulder raised a cheer , coloring the sky with ash because they found some privateer to sail across the sea of trash .
the enemy is within .
do n't confuse me with him .
the truth is otherwise .
stupidity tries .
and so i go from floor to floor looking for a port of call , another drunk conquistador conquering the governor 's ball .
i could n't think of a thing that i hope tomorrow brings .
oh , what a surprise !
stupidity tries .
