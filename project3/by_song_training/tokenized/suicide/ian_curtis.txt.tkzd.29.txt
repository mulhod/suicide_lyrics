#walked in line

all dressed in uniforms so fine , they drank and killed to pass the time .
wearing the shame of all their crimes , with measured steps they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they carried pictures of their wives and numbered tags to prove their lives .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
full of a glory never seen , they made it through the whole machine to never question anymore .
hypnotic trance .
they never saw .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line .
they walked in line , walked in line , walked in line .
