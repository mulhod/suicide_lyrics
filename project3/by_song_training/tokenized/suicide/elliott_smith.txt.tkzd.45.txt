#fond farewell

the litebrite 's now black and white because you took apart a picture that was n't right .
pitch burning on a shining sheet , the only maker that you 'd want to meet .
a dying man in a living room whose shadow paces the floor , who 'll take you out in the open door .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
it 's not what i 'm like .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who could n't get things right .
fond farewell to a friend .
he said , really , i just want to dance .
good and evil matched perfect .
it 's a great romance .
i can deal with some psychic pain if it 'll slow down my higher brain .
veins full of disappearing ink , vomiting in the kitchen sink , disconnecting from the missing link .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
it 's not what i 'm like .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who could n't get things right .
fond farewell to a friend .
i see you 're leaving me and taking up with the enemy , the cold comfort of the in between , a little less than a human being , a little less than a happy high , a little less than a suicide , the only things that you really tried .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
it 's not what i 'm like .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who could n't get things right .
fond farewell to a friend .
this is not my life .
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
