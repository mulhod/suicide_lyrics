# the trial

outside the cats are scratching .
inside the doors are latching .
on the room , the greedy gloom , the trial is revealed .
police are six feet deep with switchblades in their teeth , so no one leaves and they all believe this is absolutely real .
yes , it 's real .
and the sergeant says , "are you ready , boys ?
get ready , boys .
aim and fire . "
order in the court .
people ready for the sport .
they squirm and squeak and lick their beaks and grease their feathers down .
everybody rise .
judge is here with bathroom eyes .
a grizzly bear , he hugs his chair and the greedy gavel pounds .
yes , it pounds .
and the sergeant says , "are you ready , boys ?
get ready , boys .
aim and fire . "
in the dungeon falls , writing appeals upon the wall , and the priest in prayers is not even there , so precious is his time .
to the stake he 's tied .
the swallows sing .
the triggers slide .
he bids goodbye to the watery sky that plunges from his mind , from his mind .
and the sergeant says , "are you ready , boys ?
get ready , boys .
aim and fire . "
