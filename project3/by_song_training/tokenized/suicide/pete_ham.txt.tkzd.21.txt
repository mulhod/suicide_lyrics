#without you

well , i ca n't forget this evening and your face when you were leaving , but i guess that 's just the way the story goes .
you always smile , but in your eyes your sorrow shows .
yes , it shows .
well , i ca n't forget tomorrow when i think of all my sorrow .
i had you there , but then i let you go and now it 's only fair that i should let you know what you should know .
i ca n't live if living is without you .
i ca n't live .
i ca n't give anymore .
i ca n't live if living is without you .
i ca n't live .
i ca n't give anymore .
