#take it all

in a way , the sun has shone on me .
makes it easy to make it hard .
take an inch , take a yard , take it all .
i do n't need it at all .
any day the sun could shine on you .
makes it silly to make it bad .
take it good , take it glad , take it all .
do n't you know there 's a stronger thing keeping us together ?
do n't you know there 's a song to sing ?
sing on .
let the feeling take you high .
do n't you know there 's a stronger thing keeping us together ?
do n't you know there 's a song to sing ?
sing on .
let the feeling take you high .
any day , the sun will shine on you .
makes it silly to take it bad .
make it good , take it glad , take it all .
i do n't need it at all .
i do n't want it at all .
no , no , no .
