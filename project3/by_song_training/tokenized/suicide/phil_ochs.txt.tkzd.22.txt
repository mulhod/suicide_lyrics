# the bells

hear the sledges with the bells , silver bells .
what a world of merriment their melody foretells .
how they tinkle , tinkle , tinkle in the icy air of night .
all the heavens seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight .
keeping time , time , time with a sort of runic rhyme from the tintinnabulation that so musically wells from the bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells .
hear the mellow wedding bells , golden bells .
what a world of happiness their harmony foretells .
through the balmy air of night how they ring out their delight , through the dances and the yells and the rapture that impels .
how it swells .
how it dwells .
on the future how it tells from the swinging and the ringing of the molten golden bells , of the bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , of the rhyming and the chiming of the bells .
hear the loud alarum bells , brazen bells .
what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells .
much too horrified to speak , oh , they can only shriek for all the ears to know how the danger ebbs and flows , leaping higher , higher , higher with a desperate desire , in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire , with the bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , with the clamor and the clanging of the bells .
hear the tolling of the bells , iron bells .
what a world of solemn thought their monody compels for all the sound that floats from the rust within our throats .
and the people sit and groan in their muffled monotone and the tolling , tolling , tolling feels a glory in the rolling from the throbbing and the sobbing of the melancholy bells , oh , the bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , bells , oh , the moaning and the groaning of the bells .
