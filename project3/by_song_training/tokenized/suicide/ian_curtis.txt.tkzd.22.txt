#novelty

when people listen to you , do n't you know it means a lot because you 've got to work so hard for everything you 've got .
ca n't rest on your laurels now , not when you 've got none .
you 'll find yourself in a gutter , right back where you came from .
someone told me being in the know is the main thing .
we all need the security that belonging brings .
ca n't stand on your own in these times , against all the odds .
you all just fall behind like all the other sods .
you slap our backs and pretend you knew about all the things that we were going to do .
what you going to do ?
what you going to do when it 's over ?
you 're on your own now .
do n't you think that 's a shame ?
but you 're the only one responsible to take the blame .
so what you going to do when the novelty has gone ?
yeah , what you going to do when the novelty has gone ?
you slap our backs and pretend you knew about all the things we were going to do .
what you going to do ?
what you going to do when it 's over ?
