#gallons of rubbing alcohol flow through the strip

it hurts when you have to press that dull little thing that you 're only supposed to use once and then discard .
where do you put it ?
in the garbage can , my honest friend .
my shyness , pet her flow .
she 's only been five months late even though we have n't had sex for a week .
a meal a day , a meal , i say , and my heart 's made my .
somebody else already used the word aurora borealis .
she was tied up in chains and sam had helped her in the freezer .
she 's only five weeks late , but i have n't had a date forever , ever , ever , forever !
wish i had more , more opportunity , more chances to remember some things , so i could n't have so much pressure on my , on my , on my , um , ah , on my , um , um , head .
we 'd have so much more diversity and so much more input , so much more creative flow if we had someone in school , a git .
git , geeks in town .
ha !
come on , dave , think of one !
girls with trouble .
it should be gic .
geeks with charvels .
no , gwc .
fuck , man , this is a waste of time .
one more solo ?
yeah !
yeah !
you 're personally responsible for the entire strip to be washed away , cleansed , as if gallons of , um , rubbing alcohol flowed through the strip and were set on fire .
it did n't just singe the hair , it made it straight .
and then perry ellis came along with his broom and his silk and he , he erected a beautiful city , a city of stars .
