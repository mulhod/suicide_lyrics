truth covered in security .
i ca n't let you smother me .
i 'd like to , but it could n't work .
trading off and taking turns , i do n't regret a thing and i 've got this friend , you see ,
who makes me feel and i wanted more than i could steal .
i 'll arrest myself .
i 'll wear a shield .
i 'll go out of my way to prove i still , i still smell her on you .
do n't tell me what i want to hear .
afraid of never knowing fear .
experience anything you need .
i 'll keep fighting jealousy until it 's fucking gone .
and i 've got this friend , you see , who makes me feel and i wanted more than i could steal .
i 'll arrest myself .
i 'll wear a shield .
i 'll go out of my way to prove i still , i still smell her on you .

i 'll go out of my way to make you a deal .
we 've made a pact to learn from whoever we want without new rules .
we 'll share what 's lost and what we grew .
they 'll go out of their way to prove they still , still smell her on you , still smell her on you , still smell her on you .
