# the ballad of billie sol

billie sol was a man from the giant texas land .
he put the chamber of commerce on a limb .
they voted him the best and the government did no less until the i .o.u.s of texas fell on him .
stand tall , billie sol .
we do n't know you at all .
we 've taken down your pictures from the wall .
well , we do n't want to handle an agriculture scandal .
we have got to face elections in the fall .
i remember when bill had influential friends .
he celebrated christmas every day .
he filled texas banks with his fertilizer tanks .
influential friends do n't die .
they only fade away .
stand tall , billie sol .
we do n't know you at all .
we 've taken down your pictures from the wall .
well , we do n't want to handle an agriculture scandal .
we have got to face elections in the fall .
the democrats deny and orville freeman sighs .
he said , "everyone around was fair and square . "
but he was no more convincing than ezra taft benson as resignations cropped up everywhere .
stand tall , billie sol .
we do n't know you at all .
we 've taken down your pictures from the wall .
well , we do n't want to handle an agriculture scandal .
we have got to face elections in the fall .
and now i 'd like to say that crime sure does n't pay , but , if you want to make some money on the sly , well , you can always rent the u .s . government .
it 's the best one that money can buy .
stand tall , billie sol .
we do n't know you at all .
we 've taken down your pictures from the wall .
well , we do n't want to handle an agriculture scandal .
we have got to face elections in the fall .
