#i be not marching anymore

oh , i marched to the battle of new orleans at the end of the early british war
the young land started growing .
the young blood started flowing .
but i be not marching anymore for i 've killed my share of indians in a thousand different fights .
i was there at the little big horn .
i heard many men lying .
i saw many more dying .
but i be not marching anymore .
it 's always the old to lead us to the war .
it 's always the young to fall .
now look at all we 've won with the saber and the gun .
tell me , is it worth it all ? for i stole california from the mexican land , fought in the bloody civil war .
yes , i even killed my brothers and so many others .
but i be not marching anymore for i marched to the battles of the german trench in a war that was bound to end all wars .
oh , i must have killed a million men and now they want me back again .
but i be not marching anymore .
it 's always the old to lead us to the war .
it 's always the young to fall .
now look at all we 've won with the saber and the gun .
tell me , is it worth it all ? for i flew the final mission in the japanese sky , set off the mighty mushroom roar .
when i saw the cities burning , i knew that i was learning that i be not marching anymore .
now the labor leader 's screaming when they close the missile plants .
united fruit screams at the cuban shore .
call it peace or call it treason , call it love or call it reason , but i be not marching anymore , no , i be not marching anymore .
