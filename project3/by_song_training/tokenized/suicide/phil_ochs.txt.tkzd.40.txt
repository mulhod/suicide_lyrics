# no more songs

hello , hello , hello , is there anybody home ?
i 've only called to say , i 'm sorry .
the drums are in the dawn and all the voices gone and it seems that there are no more songs .
once i knew a girl .
she was a flower in a flame .
i loved her as the sea sings sadly .
now the ashes of the dream can be found in the magazines and it seems that there are no more songs .
once i knew a sage who sang upon the stage .
he told about the world , his lover , a ghost without a name , stands ragged in the rain and it seems that there are no more songs .
the rebels , they were here .
they came beside the door .
they told me that the moon was bleeding .
then all to my surprise they took away my eyes and it seems that there are no more songs .
a star is in the sky .
it 's time to say goodbye .
a whale is on the beach .
he 's dying .
a white flag in my hand and a white bone in the sand and it seems that there are no more songs .
hello , hello , hello , is there anybody home ?
i 've only called to say , i 'm sorry .
the drums are in the dawn and all the voices gone and it seems that there are no more songs .
it seems that there are no more songs .
it seems that there are no more songs .
