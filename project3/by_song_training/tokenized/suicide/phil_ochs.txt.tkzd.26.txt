#talking cuban crisis

it was just a little while ago , i glued my ears to the radio .
the announcer was saying we 'd better beware .
a crisis was hanging , a wave up in the air , crawling on the ground , swimming in the sea , heading for me .
well , i did n't know if i was for or against it .
he was yelling and screaming a mile a minute .
well , he said , "here comes the president ,
but first this word from pepsodent .
have whiter teeth , have cleaner breath when you 're facing nuclear death" .
and then president john began to speak and i knew right away he would n't be weak .
well , he said he 'd seen some missile bases and terrible smiles on cuban faces , close pictures , carrying land reform too far , giving land to the ussr .
well , he said we must n't be afraid .
we 're setting up a little blockade .
put our ships along the cuban shores and if the russian bear yells and roars , we 'll let him have it .
from turkey and greece , formosa and spain , the peaceful west european plain , from alaska and greenland we 'll use our means and twenty thousand submarines .
we 're going to teach the russians a lesson for trying to upset the balance of power .
now most americans stood behind the president and his military minds , but me , i stood behind a bar , dreaming of a spaceship getaway car .
head for mars , any other planet that has bars , like gerde 's folk city .
yes , it seemed the stand was strong and plain , but some republicans was going insane and they still are .
well , they said our plan was just too mild .
spare the rod and spoil the child .
let 's sink cuba into the sea and give them back democracy under the water .
well , the deadline was set for ten o'clock .
for a cold war , it was a getting hot .
well , the russians tried .
the russians failed .
homeward-bound those missiles sailed .
mr . khruschev said , "better red than dead " .
