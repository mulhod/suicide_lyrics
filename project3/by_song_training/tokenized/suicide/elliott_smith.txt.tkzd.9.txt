#angeles

someone 's always coming around here trailing some new kill .
says i seen your picture on a hundred-dollar bill .
and what 's a game of chance to you to him is one of real skill .
so glad to meet you , angeles .
picking up the ticket shows there 's money to be made .
go on and lose the gamble .
that 's the history of the trade .
you add up all the cards left to play to zero and sign up with evil .
angeles , do n't start me trying now because i 'm all over it , angeles .
i could make you satisfied in everything you do .
all your 'secret wishes ' could right now be coming true .
and be forever with my poison arms around you .
no one 's going to fool around with us .
no one 's going to fool around with us .
so glad to meet you , angeles .
