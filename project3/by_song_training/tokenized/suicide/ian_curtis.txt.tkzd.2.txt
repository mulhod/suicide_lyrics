#isolation

in fear every day , every evening , he calls her aloud from above , carefully watched for a reason , painstaking devotion and love , surrendered to self-preservation from others who care for themselves , a blindness that touches perfection , , but hurts just like anything else .
isolation , isolation , isolation .
mother , i tried .
please believe me .
i 'm doing the best that i can .
i 'm ashamed of the things i 've been put through .
i 'm ashamed of the person i am .
isolation , isolation , isolation .
but if you could just see the beauty , these things i could never describe , these pleasures a wayward distraction .
this is my one lucky prize .
isolation , isolation , isolation .
