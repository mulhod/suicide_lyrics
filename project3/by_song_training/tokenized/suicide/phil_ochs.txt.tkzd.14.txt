#song of my returning

the wild geese are dancing in the ripples of the morn .
my wanderlust is formed .
i 've got to follow them wherever they may lead for i am just a sailor on a ship across the land .
let me hold your hand to bid farewell , so i can knuckle to my
knee .
but i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love that frees the fire for burning .
then i 'll take you in my arms and tell you all i know as i sing the early song of my returning .
the weary world is waiting for ambition to be played , now young and not afraid .
i 've got to challenge every chalice that i know .
my eager ears are listening for the singing of the sign .
deeper are the lines upon the face that finds reflections in the road .
yes , i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love that frees the fire for burning .
then i 'll take you in my arms and tell you all i know as i sing the changing song of my returning .
my drifting days prepare me to do battle with the night , a phantom of the fight .
i 've got to conquer all the courage of my fears .
the answer lies in limbo and the harvest will be hard , but sacred are the scars that leave their mark on the fast disolving years .
yes , i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love that frees the fire for burning .
then i 'll take you in my arms and tell you all i know as i sing the changing song of my returning .
time must have her victory .
it 's that i 've always known .
but i won or lost alone .
and , when a voice calls out , " there 's someone you must meet" , with every strength remaining i will suffer one more scene .
i 'll gather all my dreams and with my final breath i 'll lay them at your feet .
yes , i 'll be back again no matter where i go for it 's only love that frees the fire for burning .
then i 'll take you in my arms and tell you all i know as i sing the changing song of my returning .
