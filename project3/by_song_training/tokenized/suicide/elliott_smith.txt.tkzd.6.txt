# no name # 5

got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past and everybody 's gone at last .
a sweet , sweet smile that 's fading fast because everybody 's gone at last .
and you do n't get upset about it , no not anymore .
there 's nothing wrong that was n't wrong before .
had a second alone with a chance let pass and everybody 's gone at last .
well , i hope you 're not waiting , waiting around for me because i 'm not going anywhere , obviously .
got a broken heart and your name on my cast and everybody 's gone at last .
everybody 's gone at last .
