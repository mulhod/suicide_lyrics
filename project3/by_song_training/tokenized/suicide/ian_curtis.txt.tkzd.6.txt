#heart and soul

instincts that can still betray us .
a journey that leads to the sun .
soulless and bent on destruction .
a struggle between right and wrong .
you take my place in the showdown .
i 'll observe with a pitiful eye .
i 'd humbly ask for forgiveness , a request well beyond you and i .
heart and soul , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn .
an abyss that laughs at creation .
a circus complete with all fools .
foundations that lasted the ages , then ripped apart at their roots .
beyond all this good is the terror , the grip of a mercenary hand , when savagery turns all good reason .
there 's no turning back , no last stand .
heart and soul , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn .
existence .
well , what does it matter ?
i exist on the best terms i can .
the past is now part of my future .
the present is well out of hand .
the present is well out of hand .
heart and soul , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn , one will burn , one will burn .
heart and soul , one will burn .
