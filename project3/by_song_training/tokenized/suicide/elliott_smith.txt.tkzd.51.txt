#memory lane

this is the place you 'll end up when you lose the chase where you 're dragged against your will from a basement on the hill and all anybody knows is you 're not like them and they kick you in the head and send you back to bed .
isolation pulled you past a tunnel to a bright world where you can make a place to stay , but everybody 's scared of this place .
they 're staying away , your little house on memory lane .
the mayor 's name is fear .
his force patrols the pier from a mountain of cliche that advances everyday .
the doctor spoke a cloud .
he rained out loud .
you 'll keep your doors and windows shut and swear you 'll never show a soul again , but isolation pushes you till every muscle aches down the only road it ever takes , but everybody 's scared of this place .
they 're staying away , your little house on memory lane .
if it 's your decision to be open about yourself , be careful or else , be careful or else .
uncomfortable apart , it 's all written on my chart .
and i take what 's given to me most cooperatively .
i do what people say and lie in bed all day absolutely horrified .
i hope you 're satisfied .
isolation pushes past self-hatred , guilt , and shame to a place where suffering is just a game , but everybody 's scared of this place .
they 're staying away , your little house on memory lane , your little house on memory lane .
