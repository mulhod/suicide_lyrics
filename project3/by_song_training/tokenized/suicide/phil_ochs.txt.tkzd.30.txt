#bullets of mexico

the peons of mexico long have known suffering and pain .
zapata and villa have died there , fighting in vain .
ruben jaramillo kept up the tradition .
he fought for the land once again .
he lived for the land and there on the land he was slain .
a forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun , but all of the bullets of mexico cannot undo all the work that he 's done .
the greedy capiques have stolen and plundered the land .
with pistoleros they ruled with a cold iron hand .
the poor campesinos could stand it no longer .
resistance was starting to grow .
jaramillo decided to fight for a new mexico .
a forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun , but all of the bullets of mexico cannot undo all the work that he 's done .
for twenty long years he fought and he struggled and tried , effe bonilla , his wife always there at his side .
often surrounded , he always was hounded .
they searched for him near , far and wide .
a man of deep sorrow , but also a man of deep pride .
a forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun , but all of the bullets of mexico cannot undo all the work that he 's done .
two thousand peasants he led to their long-promised land and the army 's revenge killed the wife and the sons and the man .
his assassins rejoiced with their whiskey and women .
they laughed and they danced on his grave .
now the land waits again for another to ride on the wave .
a forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun , but all of the bullets of mexico cannot undo all the work that he 's done .
