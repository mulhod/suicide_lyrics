#everything reminds me of her

i never really had a problem because of leaving , but everything reminds me of her this evening .
so , if i seem a little out of it , sorry , but why should i lie ?
everything reminds me of her .
the spin of the earth impaled a silhouette of the sun on the steeple .
and i got to hear the same sermon all the time now from you people .
why are you staring into outer space crying just because you came across it and lost it ?
everything reminds me of her .
everything reminds me of her .
everything reminds me of her .
