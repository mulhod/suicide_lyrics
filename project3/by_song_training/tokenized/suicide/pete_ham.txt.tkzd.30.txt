#perfection

there is no real perfection .
there 'll be no perfect day .
just love is our connection , the truth in what we say .
there 's no good revolution , just power changing hands .
there is no straight solution , except to understand .
so listen to my song of life .
you do n't need a gun or a knife .
successful conversation will take you very far .
there is no real perfection .
there 'll be no perfect man .
just peace is our connection , forgiving all you can .
there 's no good kind of killing , just power taking life .
it 's all good blood that 's spilling to make a bigger knife .
so listen to my song of life .
you do n't need a gun or a knife .
successful conversation will take you very far .
successful conversations will take you very far .
so listen to my song of life .
you do n't need a gun or a knife .
successful conversation will take you very far .
successful conversations will take you very far .
successful conversations will take you very far .
