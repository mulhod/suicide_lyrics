#ca n't make a sound

i have become a silent movie .
the hero killed the clown .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
nobody knows what he 's doing still hanging around .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
the slow motion moves me .
the monologue means nothing to me .
bored in the role , but he ca n't stop standing up to sit back down or lose the one thing found , spinning the world like a toy top till there 's a ghost in every town .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
ca n't make a sound .
eyes locked and shining .
ca n't you tell me what 's happening ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
why should you want any other when you 're a world within a world ?
