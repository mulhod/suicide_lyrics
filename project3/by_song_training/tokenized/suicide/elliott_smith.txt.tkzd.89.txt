#baby britain

baby britain feels the best floating over a sea of vodka , separated from the rest .
fights problems with bigger problems .
sees the ocean fall and rise .
counts the waves that somehow did n't hit her .
water pouring from her eyes , alcoholic and very bitter .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart and i ca n't help until you start .
we knocked another couple back , the dead soldiers lined up on the table still prepared for an attack .
they did n't know they 'd been disabled .
felt a wave , a rush of blood .
you wo n't be happy till the bottle 's broken and you 're out swimming in the flood you kept back , you kept unspoken .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart and i ca n't help until you start .
you got a look in your eye when you 're saying goodbye like you want to say hi .
the light was on , but it was dim .
revolver 's been turned over and now it 's ready once again .
the radio was playing " crimson and clover " .
london bridge is safe and sound .
no matter what you keep repeating , nothing 's going to drag me down to a death that 's not worth cheating .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart and i ca n't help until you start .
for someone half as smart you 'd be a work of art .
you put yourself apart .
