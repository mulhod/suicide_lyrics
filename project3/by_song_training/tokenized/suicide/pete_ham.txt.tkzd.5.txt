#song for a lost friend

you had a dream .
you know you dreamt so much .
you had a dream .
you know it meant so much .
you 're just a victim of the circumstance .
i mean , what else could you do ?
you saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true .
what could you do ?
you had a goal .
you know you aimed so high .
you had soul .
you knew you had to try .
you 're just a victim of the time of day .
no matter what you say or do , you saw your dream and you just took a play and for a while your dream came true .
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
you 're just a victim of the circumstance .
i mean , what else could you do ?
you saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true .
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
what could you do ?
