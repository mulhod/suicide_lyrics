#i did n't understand

thought you 'd be looking for the next in line to love , then ignore , put out and put away .
and so you 'd soon be leaving me alone like i 'm supposed to be tonight , tomorrow , and every day .
there 's nothing here that you 'll miss .
i can guarantee you this is a cloud of smoke , trying to occupy space .
what a fucking joke .
what a fucking joke .
i waited for a bus to separate the both of us and take me off far away from you because my feelings never change a bit .
i always feel like shit .
i do n't know why .
i guess that i just do .
you once talked to me about love and you painted pictures of a never-neverland and i could 've gone to that place , but i did n't understand , i did n't understand , i did n't understand .
