no , i do n't know just why , which way to turn .
i 've got this ticket to use .
through childlike ways rebellion and crime to reach this point and retreat back again .
the broken hearts , all the wheels that have turned , the memories scarred and the vision is blurred .
no , i do n't know just why , do n't know which way to turn , the best possible use .
just passing through till we reach the next stage .
but just to where , well , it 's all been arranged .
just passing through , but the break must be made .
should we move on or stay safely away ?
