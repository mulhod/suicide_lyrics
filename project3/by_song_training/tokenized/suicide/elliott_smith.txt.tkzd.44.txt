#strung out again

you get what you see .
i saw a rich fuck given charity , saw an evil emperor wearing my clothes .
they 're far from the best , but they might suit you better than the rest .
just looking in the mirror will make you a brave man .
i know my place .
i hate my face .
i know how i begin and how i 'll end , strung out again .
was a parliament of owls flying over a city of canals , floating on the body , floating in the dalles .
you get what you see .
some things , they just change invisiabally .
i do n't know where i 'm going .
i do n't even want to know .
i know my place .
i hate my face .
i know how i begin and how i 'll end , strung out again , standing , smiling on some fantasy island , waving at my lost reflection again , but a tide coming in and i 'm strung out again , strung out again .
