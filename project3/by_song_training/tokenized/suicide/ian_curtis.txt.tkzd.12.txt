#something must break

someone take these dreams away that point me to another day , a duel of personalities that stretch all true realities , that keep calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me .
where figures from the past stand tall and mocking voices ring the halls , imperialistic house of prayer , conquistadors who took their share that keep calling me , they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me .
they keep calling me .
calling me , calling me , calling me , calling me .
they keep calling me , keep on calling me .
they keep calling me .
they keep calling me .
