#love will tear us apart

when routine bites hard and ambitions are low and resentment rides high , but emotions wo n't grow and we 're changing our ways , taking different roads , love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
why is the bedroom so cold ?
turned away on your side .
is my timing that flawed ?
our respect run so dry ?
yet there 's still this appeal that we 've kept through our lives .
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
do you cry out in your sleep ?
all my failings exposed .
gets a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold .
why is it something so good just ca n't function no more ?
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear us apart again .
love , love will tear up apart again .
