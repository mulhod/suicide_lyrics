# the kill

moved in a hired car and i find no way to run .
adds every moment longer .
had no time for fun .
just something that i knew i had to do .
but through it all i left my eyes on you .
i had an impulse to clear it all away .
oh , i used the tactics .
make everybody pay .
just something that i knew i had to do .
but through it all i kept my eyes on you .
oh , i keep it all clean .
i 've paid the graces there .
no kings of misuse .
no sellers of flesh .
just something that i knew i had to do .
but through it all i kept my eyes on you .
yeah , through it all i kept my eyes on you .
but through it all i kept my eyes on you .
