#coast to coast

last stop for a resolution .
end of the line , is it confusion ?
so go .
go see what 's there for you .
nothing new , nothing new for you to use .
i 've got no new act to amuse you .
i 've got no desire to use you , you know , but anything that i could do would never be good enough for you .
if you ca n't help it , then just leave it alone , leave it alone .
leave it alone , yeah , just forget it .
it 's really easy .
i believe i 'll forget it too .
still you 're keeping me around till i finally drag us both down , pulling feathers out your hat .
yes , i believe that 's where it 's at .
you belong tagging along and i belong in your zoo , so i wait for confirmation that you 're never going to use your starting gun .
unless it 's me , it sounds like being him just was n't that much fun .
anything that i could do would never be good enough for you .
if you ca n't help it , then just leave it alone , leave it alone .
leave me alone , yeah , just forget it .
it 's really easy .
i 'll just forget it too .
coast to coast , coast to coast .
i 'll do what i can , so you can be what you do .
coast to coast , coast to coast .
i 'll do everything i can , so you can be what you do .
coast to coast , coast to coast .
circuit rider comes every fifth sunday .
oh , my lord , i fell asleep one day .
anything that i could do .
is there anything that i could do that someone does n't do for you , that someone did n't do for you , that i have already done for you ?
