#william moore

walking down an alabama road , remembering what the bible told , walking with a letter in his hand , dreaming of another southern land .
walking down an alabama road .
and he went by the name of william moore .
now what are you doing william moore ?
why the letter in your hand ?
there 's only one southern land and he went by the name of william moore .
what price the glory of one man ?
what price the glory of one man ?
what price the hopes ?
what price the dreams ?
and what price the glory of one man ?
remembering what his grandfather done , fought for the south in '61 .
a hundred years have passed by since then .
now moore is fighting for the south again , remembering what his grandfather done .
remembering the time in world war ii and the south pacific island that he knew , remembering the young men that he killed and praying that the guns of hate be stilled .
remembering the time in world war two .
what price the glory of one man ?
what price the glory of one man ?
what price the hopes ?
what price the dreams ?
and what price the glory of one man ?
and they shot him on the alabama road , forgot about what the bible told .
they shot him with that letter in his hand as though he were a dog and not a man .
and they shot him on the alabama road .
did you say it was a shame when he died ?
did you say he was fool because he tried ?
did you wonder who had fired the gun ?
did you know that it was you who fired the gun ?
did you say "it was a shame " when he died ?
what price the glory of one man ?
what price the glory of one man ?
what price the hopes ?
what price the dreams ?
and what price the glory of one man ?
walking down an alabama road .
