#passover

this is a crisis i knew had to come , destroying the balance i 'd kept , doubting , unsettling , and turning around , wondering what will come next .
is this the role that you wanted to live ?
i was foolish to ask for so much .
without the protection and infancy 's guard , it all falls apart at first touch .
watching the reel as it comes to a close , brutally taking its time .
people who change for no reason at all .
it 's happening all of the time .
can i go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind ?
back out of my duties when all 's said and done .
i know that i 'll lose every time .
moving along in our god-given ways .
safety is sat by the fire , sanctuary from these feverish smiles .
left with a mark on the door .
is this the gift that i wanted to give ?
"forgive and forget " 's what they teach .
or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach .
this is the crisis i knew had to come , destroying the balance i 'd kept , turning around to the next set of lives , wondering what will come next .
