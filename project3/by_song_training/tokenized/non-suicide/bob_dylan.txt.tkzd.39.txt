#love minus zero/no limit

my love , she speaks like silence , without ideals or violence .
she does n't have to say she 's faithful .
yet she 's true like ice , like fire .
people carry roses and make promises by the hours .
my love , she laughs like the flowers .
valentines ca n't buy her .
in the dimestores and bus-stations people talk of situations , read books , repeat quotations , draw conclusions on the wall .
some speak of the future .
my love , she speaks softly .
she knows there 's no success like failure and that failure 's no success at all .
the cloak and dagger dangles .
madams light the candles .
in ceremonies of the horsemen even the pawn must hold a grudge .
statues made of matchsticks crumble into one another .
my love winks .
she does not bother .
she knows too much to argue or to judge .
the bridge at midnight trembles .
the country doctor rambles .
bankers ' nieces seek perfection , expecting all the gifts that wise men bring .
the wind howls like a hammer and the night blows rainy .
my love , she 's like some raven at my window with a broken wing .
