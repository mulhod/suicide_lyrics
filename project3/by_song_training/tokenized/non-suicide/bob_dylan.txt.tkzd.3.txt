#spanish harlem incident

gypsy gal , the hands of harlem cannot hold you to its heat .
your temperature is too hot for taming .
your flaming feet are burning up the street .
i am homeless , come and take me to the reach of your rattling drums .
let me know , babe , all about my fortune down along my restless palms .
gypsy gal , you got me swallowed .
i have fallen far beneath your pearly eyes , so fast and slashing , and your flashing diamond teeth .
the night is pitch black , come and make my pale face fit into place , oh , please .
let me know , babe - i 'm nearly drowning - if it 's you my lifelines trace .
i been wondering all about me ever since i seen you there .
on the cliffs of your wildcat charms i 'm riding .
i know i 'm around you , but i do n't know where .
you have slayed me .
you have made me .
i got to laugh halfways off my heels .
i got to know , babe , will you surround me , so i can know if i 'm really real ?
