#that 's what i get

just when everything was making sense , you took away all my self-confidence .
now all that i 've been hearing must be true .
i guess i 'm not the only boy for you .
but that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
how could you turn us into this , after you just taught me how to kiss you .
i told you i 'd never say goodbye .
now i 'm slipping on the tears you made me cry .
but 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
why does it come as a surprise to think that i was so naive .
maybe did n't mean so much .
but it meant everything to me .
but 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
that 's what i get .
