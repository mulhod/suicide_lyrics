#i know

so be it .
i 'm your crowbar if that 's what i am so far , until you get out of this mess .
and i will pretend that i dont know of your sins until you are ready to confess .
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know .
and you can use my skin to bury secrets in , and i will settle you down .
and at my own suggestion , i will ask no questions while i do my thing in the background .
but all the time , all the time , i 'll know , i 'll know .
baby , i ca n't help you out while she 's still around .
so for the time being , i 'm being patient .
and amidst this bitterness , if you 'll just consider this , even if it do n't make sense all the time , give it time .
and when the crowd becomes your burden , and you 've early closed your curtains , i 'll wait by the backstage door while you try to find the lines to speak your mind and pry it open , hoping for an encore .
and if it gets too late , for me to wait for you to find you love me and tell me so , it 's ok , dont need to say it .
