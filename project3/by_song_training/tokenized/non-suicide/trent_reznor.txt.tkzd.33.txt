#survivalism

i should have listened to her .
so hard to keep control .
we kept on eating but our bloated belly 's still not full .
she gave us all she had , but we went and took some more .
ca n't seem to shut her legs .
our mother nature is a whore .
i got my propaganda .
i got revisionism .
i got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism .
all a part of this great nation .
i got my fist .
i got my plan .
i got survivalism .
hypnotic sound of sirens echoing through the street .
the cocking of the rifles , the marching of the feet .
you see your world on fire .
do n't try to act surprised .
we did just what you told us .
lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies .
i got my propaganda .
i got revisionism .
i got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism .
all a part of this great nation .
i got my fist .
i got my plan .
i got survivalism .
all bruised and broken , bleeding , she asked to take my hand .
i turned , just keep on walking , but you 'd do the same thing in the circumstance .
i 'm sure you 'll understand .
i got my propaganda .
i got revisionism .
i got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism .
all a part of this great nation .
i got my fist .
i got my plan .
i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
you got your pacifism ; i got survivalism .
i got survivalism .
