i hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed .
you were just a painted face on a trip down suicide road .
the stage was set .
the lights went out all around the old hotel .
i hate myself for loving you and i 'm glad the curtain fell .
i hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed and the mercy that you showed to me .
who ever would have guessed ?
i went out on lower broadway and i felt that place within , that hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin .
heard your songs of freedom and man , forever stripped , acting out his folly while his back is being whipped .
like a slave in orbit , he 's beaten till he 's tame .
all for a moment 's glory and it 's a dirty , rotten shame .
there are those who worship loneliness .
i 'm not one of them .
in this age of fiberglass i 'm searching for a gem .
the crystal ball upon the wall has n't shown me nothing yet .
i 've paid the price of solitude , but at least i 'm out of debt .
i ca n't recall a useful thing you ever did for me , except pat me on the back one time when i was on my knee .
we stared into each other 's eyes till one of us would break .
no use to apologize .
what difference would it make ?
so , sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine .
the naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen .
lady luck , who shines on me , will tell you where i 'm at .
i hate myself for loving you , but i should get over that .
