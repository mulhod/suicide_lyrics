#story of my life

high school seemed like such a blur .
i did n't have much interest in sports or school elections , and in class , i dreamed all day , of a rock 'n' roll weekend .
and the girl in the front of the room , so close yet so far you know she never seemed to notice that this silly schoolboy crush was n't just pretend .
life goes by so fast .
you only want to do what you think is right .
close your eyes and then it 's past .
story of my life .
and i went down my old neighborhood .
the faces have all changed ; there 's no one left to talk to , and the pool hall i loved as a kid is now a seven eleven .
i went downtown to look for a job .
i had no training , no experience to speak of .
and i looked at the holes in my jeans , and turned and headed back .
life goes by so fast .
you only want to do what you think is right .
close your eyes and then it 's past .
story of my life .
good times come , and good times go .
i only wish the good times would last a little longer .
and i think about the good times we had and why they had to end .
so i sit at the edge of my bed .
i strum my guitar and i sing an outlaw love song .
thinking 'bout what you 're doing now , and when you 're coming back .
life goes by so fast .
you only want to do what you think is right .
close your eyes and then it 's past .
story of my life .
