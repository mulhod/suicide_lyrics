#i do n't believe you

i ca n't understand .
she let go of my hand and left me here facing the wall .
i 'd sure like to know why she did go , but i ca n't get close to her at all .
though we kissed through the wild , blazing night-time , she said she would never forget .
but now morning is clear .
it 's like i be not here .
she acts like we never met .
it 's all new to me , like some mystery .
it could even be like a myth .
but it 's hard to think on that she 's the same one that last night i was with .
from darkness , dreams are deserted .
am i still dreaming yet ?
i wish she 'd unlock her voice once and talk instead of acting like we never met .
if she be not feeling well , then why do n't she tell instead of turning her back to my face ?
without any doubt she seems too far out for me to return to or chase .
and her skirt , it swayed as the guitar played .
her mouth was watery and wet .
but now something has changed for she be not the same .
she just acts like we never have met .
if i did n't have to guess , i 'd gladly confess to anything i might 've tried .
if i was with her too long or have done something wrong , i 'd wish she 'd tell me what it is .
i 'll run and hide .
though the night ran swirling and whirling , i remember her whispering yet .
but evidently she do n't .
evidently she wo n't .
she just acts like we never have met .
i 'm leaving today .
i 'll be on my way .
of this i ca n't say very much .
but if you want me to , i can be just like you and pretend that we never have touched .
and , if anybody asks me , "is it easy to forget ? "
i 'll say , "it 's easily done .
you just pick anyone and pretend that you never have met . "
