#beginning of the end

down on your knees you 'll be left behind .
this is the beginning .
watch what you think they can read your mind .
this is the beginning .
i got my mark ; see it in my eyes .
this is the beginning .
my reflection i do n't recognize .
this is the beginning .
we think we climb so high all up the backs we 've condemned .
we face our consequence .
this is the beginning of the end .
you wait your turn , you 'll be last in line .
this is the beginning .
get out the way cause i 'm getting mine .
this is the beginning .
god helps the ones that help themselves .
this is the beginning .
may be too late as far as i can tell .
this is the beginning .
we think we 've come so far .
on all our lies we depend .
we face our consequence .
this is the beginning of the end .
