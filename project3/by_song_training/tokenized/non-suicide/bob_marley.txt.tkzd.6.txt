#kaya

wake up and , wake up and , wake up and turn i loose , for the rain is falling .
got to have kaya now .
got to have kaya now .
got to have kaya now , for the rain is falling .
i 'm so high , i even touch the sky above the falling rain .
i feel so good in my neighbourhood , so here i come again .
got to have kaya now .
got to have kaya now .
got to have kaya now , for the rain is falling .
feeling irie i .

feeling irie i because i have some kaya now .
i feel so high , i even touch the sky above the falling rain .
i feel so good in my neighbourhood , so here i come again .
got to have kaya now .
got to have kaya now .
got to have kaya now , for the rain is falling .
wake up and turn i loose .
wake up and turn i loose .
wake up and turn i loose , for the rain is falling .
kaya now , kaya , kaya .

kaya now , kaya , kaya .
