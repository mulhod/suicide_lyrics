#carrion

wo n't do no good to hold no seance .
what 's gone is gone , and you ca n't bring it back around .
wo n't do no good to hold no searchlight .
you ca n't illuminate what time has anchored down .
oh , honey , i 've gone away .
oh , honey , i 've gone away .
oh , honey , i 've gone away .
wo n't do no good to sing no love song .
no sound could simulate the presence of a man .
wo n't do no good asking no questions .
your divination should acquaint you with the plan .
oh , honey i 've gone away .
honey , i 've gone away .
honey , i 've gone away .
my feel for you , boy , is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered pery .
and all i want is to save you , honey , or the strength to walk away .
wo n't do no good to go no distance .
the space between us is as boundless as the dark .
wo n't do no good to throw no fists , babe .
you ca n't intimidate me back into your arms .
because honey , i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
i 've gone away .
my feel for you , boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey .
and all i want is to save you , honey or the strength to walk away .
my feel for you , boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey .
and all i want is to save you , honey or the strength to walk away .
my feel for you , boy is decaying in front of me like the carrion of a murdered prey .
and all i want is to save you , honey or the strength to walk away .
