#love ridden

love ridden , i 've looked at you with the focus i gave to my birthday candles .
i 've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow .
and baby , i wished for you .
nobody sees when you are lying in your bed , and i want to crawl in with you , but i cry instead .
i want your warm , but it will only make me colder when it 's over .
so i ca n't tonight , baby .
no , not "baby " anymore .
if i need you , i 'll just use your simple name .
only kisses on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .
my hand wo n't hold you down no more .
the path is clear to follow through .
i stood too long in the way of the door mp fiona apple , and now i 'm giving up on you .
no , not "baby " anymore .
if i need you , i 'll just use your simple name .
only kisses on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .
no , not "baby " anymore .
if i need you , i 'll just use your simple name .
only kisses on the cheek from now on , and in a little while , we 'll only have to wave .
