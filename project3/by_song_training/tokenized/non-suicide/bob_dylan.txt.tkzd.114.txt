# the times they are a-changin'

come gather around , people , wherever you roam and admit that the waters around you have grown and accept it , that soon you 'll be drenched to the bone .
if your time to you is worth saving , then you better start swimming or you 'll sink like a stone for the times , they are changing .
come , writers and critics , who prophesize with your pen , and keep your eyes wide .
the chance wo n't come again .
and do n't speak too soon for the wheel 's still in spin and there 's no telling who that it 's naming for the loser now will be later to win for the times , they are changing .
come , senators , congressmen , please heed the call .
do n't stand in the doorway , do n't block up the hall for he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled .
the battle outside , raging , will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls for the times , they are changing .
come , mothers and fathers throughout the land , and do n't criticize what you ca n't understand .
your sons and your daughters are beyond your command .
your old road is rapidly aging .
please get out of the new one if you ca n't lend your hand for the times , they are changing .
the line , it is drawn .
the curse , it is cast .
the slow one now will later be fast as the present now will later be past .
the order is rapidly fading and the first one now will later be last for the times , they are changing .
