slave driver , the table is turn .
catch a fire .
catch a fire .
going to get burn .
catch a fire , whoa , now !
every time i hear the crack of a whip , my blood runs cold .
i remember on the slave ship , how they brutalize the very souls .
today they say that we are free only to be chained in poverty .
good god , i think it 's illiteracy .
it 's only a machine that makes money .
slave driver , the table is turn , you all .
slave driver , uh , the table is turn , baby , now .
catch a fire .
catch a fire , so you can get burn , baby , now .
catch a fire .
slave driver , the table is turn , you all .

so you can get burn , now .
catch a fire .
every time i hear the crack of a whip , my blood runs cold .
i remember on the slave ship how they brutalize the very soul .
oh , god , have mercy on our souls !
oh , slave driver , the table is turn , you all .
catch a fire .
catch a fire , so you can get burn .
catch a fire .
slave driver , the table is turn , you all .
catch a fire .
