#on the bound

all my life is on me now .
hail the pages turning .
and the future is on the bound .
hell do n't know my fury .
you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need youre all i need - and maybe some faith would do me good .
i do n't know what i 'm doing .
do n't know , should i change my mind ?
i ca n't decide .
there 's too many variations to consider .
no thing i do do n't do no thing but bring me more to do .
it 's true , i do imbue my blue unto myself .
i make it bitter .
baby , lay your head on my lap one more time .
tell me you belong to me .
baby say that it 's all going to be alright .
i believe that it is n't .
you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need you 're all i need , you 're all i need , you 're all i need youre all i need - and maybe some faith would do me good , and maybe some faith would do me good , and maybe some faith would do me good .
