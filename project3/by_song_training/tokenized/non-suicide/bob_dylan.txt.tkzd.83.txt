#one more weekend

slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run , i 'm looking good to see you , yeah , and we can have some fun .
one more weekend , one more weekend with you .
one more weekend , one more weekend 'll do .
come on down to my ship , honey .
ride on deck ,
we 'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect .
one more weekend , one more weekend with you .
one more weekend , one more weekend 'll do .
we 'll fly the night away , hang out the whole next day .
things will be ok .
you wait and see .
we 'll go someplace unknown , leave all the children home .
honey , why not go alone , just you and me ?
coming and going like a rabbit in the wood , i 'm happy just to see you , yeah , looking so good .
one more weekend , one more weekend with you .
one more weekend , one more weekend 'll do .
yes , you will !
like a needle in a haystack , i 'm going to find you yet .
you 're the sweetest , gone mama that this boy 's ever going to get .
one more weekend , one more weekend with you .
one more weekend , one more weekend 'll do .
