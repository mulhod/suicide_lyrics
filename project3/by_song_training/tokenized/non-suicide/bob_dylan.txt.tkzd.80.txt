#if dogs run free

if dogs run free , why not we across the swooping plain ?
my ears hear a symphony of two mules , trains , and rain .
the best is always yet to come .
that 's what they explain to me .
just do your thing , you 'll be king if dogs run free .
if dogs run free , why not me across the swamp of time ?
my mind weaves a symphony and tapestry of rhyme .
oh , winds , which rush my tale to thee , so it may flow and be , to each his own .
it 's all unknown if dogs run free .
if dogs run free , then what must be must be and that is all .
true love can make a blade of grass stand up straight and tall .
in harmony with the cosmic sea , true love needs no company .
it can cure the soul .
it can make it whole if dogs run free .
