#diamond in the rough

well , i 've been up , yeah , and i 've been down .
been kicked around , yeah , this god-forsaken town .
so many faults , so little time , i 've got to find my piece of mind , peace of mind .
i was looking for something , anything at all .
something to believe in spray-painted on the walls .
i 've made mistakes , yeah , i 've paid for them too .
what 's a poor boy supposed to do ?
then she said , yea , you 're like a diamond in the rough .
you 're dirty and you 're damaged , all you need 's a little love .
but inside there 's a sparkle that 'll light the stars above .
and you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
there was a time when i could not say i got a reason to live another day .
a discarded treasure , they all passed on by and i can understand the reasons why .
then she said , yea , you 're like a diamond in the rough .
you 're dirty and you 're damaged , all you need 's a little love .
but inside there 's a sparkle that 'll light the stars above .
you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
then she said , yeah , you 're like a diamond in the rough .
you 're dirty and you 're damaged , all you need 's a little love .
but inside there 's a sparkle that 'll light the stars above .
and you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
yea , yea , diamond in the rough .
yea , yea , going to light the stars above .
yea , yea , all you need 's a little love .
you 'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough .
diamond in the rough now .
yea , yea who 'll light the stars above now .
yea , yea all you need 's a little love now , yea , yea , yea , yea .
