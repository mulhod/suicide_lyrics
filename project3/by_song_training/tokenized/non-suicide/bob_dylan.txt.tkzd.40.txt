aing . it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon , especially when it 's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon ?
aing . going to hang no picture .
aing . going to hang no picture-frame .
aing . going to hang no picture or hang no picture-frame .
well , i might look like robert ford , but i feel just like jesse james .
well , i wish i was on some australian mountain range .
oh , i wish i was on some australian mountain range .
i got no reason to be there , but i imagine it would be some kind of change .
i got my dark sunglasses .
i got for good luck my black tooth .
i got my dark sunglasses ,
i 'm carrying for good luck my black tooth .
do n't ask me nothing about nothing .
i just might tell you the truth .
i got a woman in jackson .
oh , i be not going to say her name .
i got a woman in jackson .
i be not going to say her name .
she 's a brown-skin woman , but i , i love her just the same .
