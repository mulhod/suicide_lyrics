hollis brown , he lived on the outside of town .
hollis brown , he lived on the outside of town with his wife and five children and his cabin broken down .
you looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile .
you looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile .
your children are so hungry that they do n't know how to smile .
your baby 's eyes look crazy .
they 're tugging at your sleeve .
your baby 's eyes look crazy .
they 're tugging at your sleeve .
you walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe .
the rats have got your flour .
bad blood , it got your mare .
the rats have got your flour .
bad blood , it got your mare .
if there 's anyone that knows , is there anyone that cares ?
you prayed to the lord above , oh , please send you a friend .
you prayed to the lord above , oh , please send you a friend .
your empty pockets tell you that you be not got no friend .
your babies 're crying louder now .
it 's pounding on your brain .
your babies 're crying louder now .
it 's pounding on your brain .
your wife 's screams 're stabbing you like the dirty , driving rain .
your grass is turning black .
there 's no water in your well .
your grass is turning black .
there 's no water in your well .
you spent your last , lone dollar on seven shotgun shells .
way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls .
way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls .
your eyes fix on the shotgun that 's hanging on the wall .
your brain is bleeding and your legs ca n't seem to stand .
your brain is bleeding and your legs ca n't seem to stand .
your eyes fix on the shotgun that you 're holding in your hand .
there 's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door .
there 's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door .
seven shots ring out like the ocean 's pounding roar .
there 's seven people dead on a south dakota farm .
there 's seven people dead on a south dakota farm .
somewheres in the distance there 's seven new people born .
