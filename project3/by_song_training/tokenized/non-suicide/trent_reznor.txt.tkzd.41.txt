#meet your master

bow down in position against the polished steel .
this is something different .
you 'll like this way this feels .
no time for asking questions .
no time for wondering .
we 've heard enough from you now .
we 've heard everything .
we 're going to play a new game .
you 'll put on this blindfold .
you 'll do what we tell you .
you 'll do as your told .
used to be the leader .
now comes the time to serve .
maybe we show some mercy .
maybe you get what you deserve .
count down to the end , got to make it come faster , faster .
right around the bend is a coming disaster .
count down to the end , and we 're headed there faster .
come on down , my friend .
it 's time to meet your master .
you 've left quite a mess here under your stewardship .
you thought you 'd figured it out , but you 'll learn your place in this .
might take some convincing for you to see the truth .
there are so many things that we 've got in store for you .
count down to the end , got to make it come faster , faster .
right around the bend , is a coming disaster .
count down to the end , and we 're headed there faster , faster .
come on down , my friend .
it 's time to meet your master .
