#window

i was staring out the window the whole time he was talking to me .
it was a filthy pane of glass .
i could n't get a clear view .
and as he wenton and on , it was n't the outside world i could see .
just the filthy pane that i was looking through .
so i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
better that i break the window than him or her or me .
i was never focused on just one thing .
my eyes got fixed when my mind got soft .
it may look like i 'm concentrated on a very clear view , but i 'm as good as asleep.
i bet you did n't know .
it takes a lot of it away , if you do .
i had to break the windo .
it just had to be .
better that i break the window than him or her or me .
i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
it was in my way .
better that i break the window than forget what i had to say , or miss what i should see .
because the fact being that whatever 's in frontof me is covering my view .
so i ca n't see what i 'm seeing , in fact .
i only see what i 'm looking through .
so again i done the right thing .
i was never worried about that .
the answer 's always been in clear view .
but even when the window was cleaned , i still ca n't see for the fact that when it 's clean it 's so clear , i ca n't tell what i 'm looking through .
so i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
it was in my way .
better that i break the window than him or her or me .
i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
better that i break the window than miss what i should see .
i had to break the window .
it just had to be .
it was in my way .
better that i break the window than forget what i had to say , or miss what i should see , or break him her or me .
especially me .
