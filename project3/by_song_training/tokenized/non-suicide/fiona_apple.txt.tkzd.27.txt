#paper bag

i was staring at the sky , just looking for a star to pray on , or wish on , or something like that .
i was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy whose reality i knew was a hopeless to be had .
but then the dove of hope began its downward slope , and i believed for a moment that my chances were approaching to be grabbed .
but as it came down near , so did a weary tear .
i thought it was a bird , but it was just a paper bag .
hunger hurts , and i want him so bad , oh it kills because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up .
i got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold .
hunger hurts , but starving works , when it costs too much to love .
and i went crazy again today , looking for a strand to climb , looking for a little hope .
baby said he could n't stay , would n't put his lips to mine , and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope .
i said , "honey , i do n't feel so good , do n't feel justified .
come on put a little love here in my void . "
he said "it 's all in your head , "
and i said , " so 's everything" , but he did n't get it .
i thought he was a man but he was just a little boy .
hunger hurts , and i want him so bad , oh it kills because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up .
i got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold .
hunger hurts , but starving works , when it costs too much to love .
hunger hurts , but i want him so bad , oh it kills because i know i 'm a mess he do n't want to clean up .
i got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold .
hunger hurts , but starving works , when it costs too much to love .
hunger hurts , but i want him so bad , oh it kills because i know i 'm a mess that he do n't want to clean up .
i got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold .
hunger hurts , but starving , it works , when it costs too much to love .
