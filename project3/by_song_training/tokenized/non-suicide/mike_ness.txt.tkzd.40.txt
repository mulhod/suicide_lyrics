#crown of thorns

pretty much been alone now for almost five years .
i could always find a way to hide these bitter tearsa
and still i 'm a-waiting a-wishing somehow ; i wish i knew then what i know now .
it 's no bed of roses , it be not no crown of thorns .
better than lonely .
i 've been there before .
got a bad reputation for playing with love .
going to play again now and beat the odds above .
and still i 'm a-waiting and wishing somehow ; i wish i knew then what i know now .
it 's no bed of roses , it be not no crown of thorns .
better than lonely .
i 've been there before .
are you tired of being alone ?
or have you fallen out of love ?
do you care enough about yourself ?
i have worn your crown of thorns .
it 's no bed of roses , it be not no crown of thorns .
better than lonely .
i 've been there before .
it 's no bed of roses , it be not no crown of thorns .
better than lonely .
i 've been there before .
