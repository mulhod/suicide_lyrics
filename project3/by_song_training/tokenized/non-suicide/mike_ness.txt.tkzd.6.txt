#ca n't take it with you

i 'll tell you something , baby that 's a fact : never see a hearse , with a luggage rack .
all your money , your hard earned pay , it do n't mean shit , baby , at the end of the end of the day .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
as sure as life , and the light of day , i 'll tell you something , i 've heard them they say : it do n't matter , baby , what your worth , since we all , we all go back to mother earth .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
work all your life , you become a slave .
there be not no spending when you 're in the grave .
even if it 's raining , thousand dollar bills , think of me baby , in your mansion on the hill .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you ( oh yeah ) , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you ...
