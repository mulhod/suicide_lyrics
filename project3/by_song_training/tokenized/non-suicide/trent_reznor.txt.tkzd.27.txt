#reptile

she spread herself wide open to let the insects in .
she leaves a trail of honey to show me where she 's been .
she has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin .
seeds from a thousand others drip down from within .
oh , my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
devils speak of the ways in which she 'll manifest .
angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress .
need to contaminate , to alleviate this loneliness .
i now know the depths i reach are limitless .
oh my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
oh , oh , my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
oh , my beautiful liar , oh my precious whore , my disease my infection , i am so impure .
