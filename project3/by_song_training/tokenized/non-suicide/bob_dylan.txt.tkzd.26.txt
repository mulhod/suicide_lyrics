#tangled up in blue

early one morning the sun was shining .
i was laying in bed , wondering if she 'd changed at all , if her hair was still red .
her folks , they said our lives together sure was going to be rough .
they never did like mama 's homemade dress .
papa 's bankbook was n't big enough .
and i was standing on the side of the road , rain falling on my shoes , heading out for the east coast .
lord knows , i 've paid some dues getting through , tangled up in blue .
she was married when we first met , soon to be divorced .
i helped her out of a jam , i guess , but i used a little too much force .
we drove that car as far as we could , abandoned it out west , split up on a dark , sad night , both agreeing it was best .
she turned around to look at me as i was walking away .
i heard her say over my shoulder , "we 'll meet again someday on the avenue , tangled up in blue . "
i had a job in the great north woods , working as a cook for a spell , but i never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell , so i drifted down to new orleans , where i lucky was to be employed , working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of delacroix .
but , all the while i was alone , the past was close behind .
i seen a lot of women , but she never escaped my mind and i just grew tangled up in blue .
she was working in a topless place and i stopped in for a beer .
i just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear and later on , when the crowd thinned out , i was just about to do the same , she was standing there in back of my chair , said to me , "do n't i know your name ? "
i muttered something underneath my breath .
she studied the lines of my face .
i must admit , felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe , tangled up in blue .
she lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe .
"i thought you 'd never say hello , " she said .
"you look like the silent type . "
then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me , written by an italian poet from the fifteenth century , and every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal , pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul , from me to you , tangled up in blue .
i lived with them on montague street in a basement down the stairs .
there was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air .
then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died .
she had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside .
and , when it finally the bottom fell out , i became withdrawn .
the only thing i knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew , tangled up in blue .
so , now i 'm going back again .
i got to get to her somehow .
all the people we used to know , they 're an illusion to me now .
some are mathematicians .
some are carpenters ' wives .
do n't know how it all got started .
i do n't know what they 're doing with their lives , but me , i 'm still on the road , heading for another joint .
we always did feel the same .
we just saw it from a different point of view , tangled up in blue .
