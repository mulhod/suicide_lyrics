#one more night

one more night the stars are in sight , but tonight i 'm as lonesome as can be .
oh , the moon is shining bright , lighting everything in sight , but tonight no moonlight will shine on me .
oh , it 's shameful and it 's sad .
i lost the only pal i had .
i just could not be what she wanted me to be .
i will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky for tonight no moonlight will shine on me .
i was so mistaken when i thought that she 'd be true .
i had no idea what a woman in love would do .
one more night i will wait for the light while the wind blows high above the tree .
oh , i miss my darling so .
i did n't mean to see her go , but tonight no moonlight will shine on me .
one more night the moon is shining bright and the wind blows high above the tree .
oh , i miss that woman so .
i did n't mean to see her go , but tonight no moonlight will shine on me .
