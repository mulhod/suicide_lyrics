#i want you

the guilty undertaker sighs .
the lonesome organ-grinder cries .
the silver saxophones say i should refuse you .
the cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn , but it 's not that way , i was n't born to lose you .
i want you .
i want you .
i want you so bad .
honey , i want you .
the drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep and the saviors , who are fast asleep , they wait for you and i wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup and ask me to open up the gate for you .
i want you .
i want you .
yes , i want you so bad .
honey , i want you .
now , all my fathers , they 've gone down .
true love , they 've been without it .
but all their daughters put me down because i do n't think about it .
well , i return to the queen of spades and talk with my chambermaid .
she knows that she 's not afraid to look at her .
she is good to me and there 's nothing she does n't see .
she knows where i 'd like to be , but it does n't matter .
i want you .
i want you .
yes , i want you so bad .
honey , i want you .
now , your dancing child with his chinese suit , he spoke to me .
i took his flute .
no , i was n't very cute to him , was i ?
but i did it because he lied , because he took you for a ride , and because time was on his side and because i want you .
i want you .
yes , i want you so bad .
honey , i want you .
