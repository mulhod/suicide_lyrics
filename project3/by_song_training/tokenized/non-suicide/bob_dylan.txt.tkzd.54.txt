# just like tom thumb 's blues

when you 're lost in the rain in juarez and it 's eastertime , too , and your gravity fails and negativity do n't pull you through , do n't put on any airs when you 're down on rue morgue avenue .
they got some hungry women there and they really make a mess out of you .
now , if you see saint annie , please tell her " thanks a lot " .
i cannot move .
my fingers are all in a knot .
i do n't have the strength to get up and take another shot and my best friend , my doctor , wo n't even say what it is i 've got .
sweet melinda , the peasants call her the "goddess of gloom" .
she speaks good english and she invites you up into her room .
and you 're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon as she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon .
up on housing project hill it 's either fortune or fame .
you must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim .
if you 're looking to get silly , you better go back to from where you came because the cops do n't need you and , man , they expect the same .
now , all the authorities , they just stand around and boast how they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post and picking up angel , who just arrived here from the coast , who looked so fine at first , but left looking just like a ghost .
i started out on burgundy , but soon hit the harder stuff .
everybody said they 'd stand behind me when the game got rough , but the joke was on me .
there was nobody even there to bluff .
i 'm going back to new york city .
i do believe i 've had enough .
