#fast as you can

i let the beast in too soon .
i do n't know how to live without my hand on his throat .
i fight him always , and still , oh darling , it 's so sweet , you think you know how crazy how crazy i am .
you say you do n't spook easy ; you wo n't go , but i know and i pray that you will .
fast as you can , baby , run , free yourself of me , fast as you can .
i may be soft in your palm , but i 'll soon grow hungry for a fight , and i will not let you win .
my pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will disprove your faith in man .
so if you catch me trying to find my way into your heart from under your skin , fast as you can , baby , scratch me out , free yourself , fast as you can .
fast as you can , baby , scratch me out , free yourself , fast as you can .
sometimes my mind do n't shake and shift , but most of the time , it does .
and i get to the place where i 'm begging for a lift , or i 'll drown in the wonders and the was .
and i 'll be your girl , if you say it 's a gift .
and you give me some more of your drugs .
yeah , i 'll be your pet , if you just tell me it 's a gift .
because i 'm tired of whys , choking on whys .
just need a little because , because ...
i let the beast in , and then i even tried forgiving him , but it 's too soon .
so i 'll fight again , again , again , again , again .
and for a little while more , i 'll soar the uneven wind , complain and blame the sterile land .
but if you 're getting any bright ideas , quiet dear i 'm blooming within .
fast as you can , baby , wait , watch me , i 'll be out fast as i can , maybe late but at least about .
fast as you can leave me , let this thing run its route , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can .
