#something there is about you

something there is about you that strikes a match in me .
is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free ?
or is it because you remind me of something that used to be , something that 's crossed over from another century ?
thought i 'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth , rainy days on the great lakes , walking the hills of old duluth .
there was me and danny lopez , cold eyes , black nights , and then there was ruth .
something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth .
suddenly i found you and the spirit in me sings .
do n't have to look no further .
you 're the soul of many things .
i could say that i 'd be faithful .
i could say it in one sweet , easy breath , but to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death .
something there is about you that moves with style and grace .
i was in a whirlwind .
now i 'm in some better place .
my hand 's on the saber and you 've picked up on the baton .
something there is about you that i ca n't quite put my finger on .
