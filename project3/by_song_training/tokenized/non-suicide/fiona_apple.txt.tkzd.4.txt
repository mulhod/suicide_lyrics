#better version of me

the nickel dropped when i was on my way beyond the rubicon .
what did i do ?
and of the games that i can handle , none are ones worth the candle .
what should i do ?
i 'm a frightened , fickle person fighting , crying , kicking , cursing .
what should i do ?
oooh , after all the folderol , and hauling over coals stops , what will i do ?
ca n't take a good day without a bad one .
do n't feel just to smile until i 've had one .
where did i learn ?
i make a fuss about a little thing .
the rhyme is losing to the riddling .
where 's the turn ?
i do n't want a home ; i 'd ruin that .
home is where my habits have a habitat .
why give it a turn ?
oh , after all the folderol , and hauling over coals stops what did i learn ?
i am likely to miss the main eventif i stop to cry or complain again , so i will keep a deliberate pace , let the damned breeze dry my face .
oh , mister , wait until you see what i 'm going to be .
i 've got a plan , a demand , and it just began , and if you 're right , you 'll agree .
here 's coming a better version of me .
here it comes a better version of me .
here it comes a better version of me .
