#parting gift

i opened my eyes while you were kissing me once , more than once , and you looked as sincere as a dog .
just as sincere as a dog does , when it 's the food on your lips with which it 's in love .
i bet you could never tell that i knew you did n't know me that well .
it is my fault , you see , you never learned that much from me .
oh you silly , stupid pastime of mine , you were always good for a rhyme , and from the first to the last time , the signs said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
it said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
i took off my glasses while you were yelling at me once , more than once , so 's not to see you see me react .
should 've put 'em , should 've put 'em on again , so i could see you see me sincerely yelling back .
i bet your fortressed face belied your fort of lace .
it is by the grace of me you never learned what i could see .
oh you silly , stupid pastime of mine , you were always good for a rhyme , and from the first to all the last times , all the signs said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
it said " stop" , but we wenton whole-hearted .
it ended bad , but i love what we started .
