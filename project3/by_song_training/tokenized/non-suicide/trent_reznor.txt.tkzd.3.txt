#happiness in slavery

slave screams , he thinks he knows what he wants .
slave screams , thinks he has something to say .
slave screams , he hears but does n't want to listen .
slave screams , he 's being beat into submission .
do n't open your eyes , you wo n't like what you see .
the devils of truth steal the souls of the free .
do n't open your eyes , take it from me .
i have found , you can find , happiness is slavery .
slave screams , he spends his life learning conformity .
slave screams , he claims he has his own identity .
slave screams , he 's going to cause the system to fall .
slave screams but he 's glad to be chained to that wall .
do n't open your eyes , you wo n't like what you see .
the blind have been blessed with security .
do n't open your eyes , take it from me .
i have found , you can find , happiness is slavery .
i do n't know what i am .
i do n't know where i 've been .
human junk , just words and so much skin .
stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine .
just some flesh caught in this big , broken machine .
