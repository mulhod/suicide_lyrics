#brainwashing

ooh-ooh , old mr . joe , he build a house away on top of some hill .
old mr . joe knew he had to go , so he got right down and wrote bank will .
he say now , here 's to mother hen and her chicken .
lord , have mercy now .
master , will you take a roll in the mud like you know you should ?
the old barnyard , the old barnyard .
birds and the chick , ooh-wee .
who 's got to watch out for brother mongoose with his top hat and walking-stick ?
it 's just the poor 's brainwashing , poor 's brainwashing .
they told me a long time ago : it 's just the poor 's brainwashing , ooh-wee , poor 's brainwashing .
now look at a thing like this :
cinderella and her long-lost fellow , in the midnight hour , she lost her silver slipper .
humpty dumpty sat on a wall while jack and jill had themselves a fall .
it 's just the poor 's brainwashing , poor 's brainwashing , and i do n't need it no longer .
poor brainwashing .
it 's just the poor 's brainwashing coming through to a poor man 's child .
ooh-wee , look at this .
little miss muffet she sat on a tuffet while little red riding hood delivered her grandmom 's food .
ooh-wee , ooh-wee , ooh-wee , look at one more thing like this .
the cow jumping over the moon while the dish got jealous .
he grabbed the handy spoon .
it 's just the poor 's brainwashing and i do n't need it no longer .
i do n't want it no longer .
i do n't need it no longer .
poor 's brainwashing .
and i do n't care for no more brainwashing , poor 's brainwashing .
