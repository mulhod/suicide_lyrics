#went to see the gypsy

i went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel .
he smiled when he saw me coming and he said , "well , well , well . "
his room was dark and crowded .
lights were low and dim .
"how are you ? " he said to me .
i said it back to him .
i went down to the lobby to make a small call out .
a pretty , dancing girl was there and she began to shout , "go on back to see the gypsy !
he can move you from the rear , drive you from your fear , bring you through the mirror .
he did it in las vegas and he can do it here ! "
outside the lights were shining on the river of tears .
i watched them from the distance with the music in my ears .
i went back to see the gypsy .
it was nearly early dawn .
the gypsy 's door was open wide , but the gypsy was gone .
and that pretty , dancing girl , she could not be found , so i watched that sun come rising from the little minnesota town , from the little minnesota town .
