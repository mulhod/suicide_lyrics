#ringfinger

well you 've got me working so heard lately .
working my hands until they bleed .
if i was twice the man i could be .
i 'd still be half of what you need .
still you lead me and i follow .
anything you ask you know i 'll do .
but this one act of consecration is what i ask of you .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me .
well you just left me nailed here hanging like jesus on the cross .
i 'll be dying for your sins .
and aiding to the cause .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me .
wrap my eyes in bandages as confessions i see through .
i get everything i want when i get part of you .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , sever flesh and bone , and offer it to me .
ringfinger , a promise carved in stone , deeper than the sea .
ringfinger , devil 's flesh and bone do something for me .
