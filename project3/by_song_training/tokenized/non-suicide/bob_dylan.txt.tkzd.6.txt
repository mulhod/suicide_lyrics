# to ramona

ramona , come closer , shut softly your watery eyes .
the pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise .
for the flowers of the city , though breath-like , get death-like sometimes and there 's no use in trying to deal with the dying , though i cannot explain that in lines .
your cracked country lips i still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin .
your magnetic movement still captures the minutes i 'm in .
but it grieves my heart , love , to see you trying to be a part of a world that just do n't exist .
it 's all just a dream , babe , a vacuum , a scheme , babe , that sucks you into feeling like this .
i can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth .
i can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the south .
you 've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand .
yet there 's no one to beat you , no one to defeat you except the thoughts of yourself feeling bad .
i 've heard you say many times that you 're better than no one and no one is better than you .
if you really believe that , you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose .
from fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem that hype you and type you and making you feel that you got to be just like them .
i 'd forever talk to you , but soon my words , they would turn into a meaningless ring for deep in my heart i know there 's no help i can bring .
everything passes , everything changes .
just do what you think you should do and someday maybe , who knows , baby , i 'll come and be crying to you .
