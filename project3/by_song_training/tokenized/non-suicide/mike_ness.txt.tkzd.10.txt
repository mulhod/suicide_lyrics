#do n't take me for granted

i 'm your worn in leather jacket .
i 'm the volume in your fucked up teenage band .
a bag of smokes and a six pack , i 'm the dreams you had walkin down the railroad tracks , you and me .
i 'm your first taste of romance .
i 'm your first broken heart on a saturday night .
guys like us be not got no chance , but i 'm the thing that keeps you and me alive , but not forever .
so take me down the road .
take me to the show .
it 's something to believe in that no one else knows .
but do n't take me for granted .
i 'm the blood on your guitar .
i 'm that wave you caught back in 1975 .
i 'm as strong as a thousand armies .
i 'm as soft as a pedal on a long stem rose .
i am love .
so take me down the road .
take me to the show .
it 's something to believe in that no one else knows .
but do n't take me for granted .
i 'm with you when you 're born .
you can take me when you die
with all the reasons why .
but do n't take me for granted .
no one knows .
do n't take me for granted .
