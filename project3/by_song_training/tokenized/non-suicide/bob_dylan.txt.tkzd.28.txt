#you're a big girl now

our conversation was short and sweet .
it nearly swept me off of my feet .
and i 'm back in the rain .
oh , and you are on dry land .
you made it there somehow .
you 're a big girl now .
bird on the horizon sitting on a fence , he 's singing his song for me at his own expense .
and i 'm just like that bird , oh , singing just for you .
i hope that you can hear , hear me singing through these tears .
time is a jet plane .
it moves too fast .
oh , but what a shame that all we 've shared ca n't last .
i can change , i swear .
oh , see what you can do .
i can make it through .
you can make it , too .
love is so simple , to quote a phrase .
you 've known it all the time .
i 'm learning it these days .
oh , i know where i can find you , oh , in somebody 's room .
it 's a price i have to pay .
you 're a big girl all the way .
a change in the weather is known to be extreme , but what 's the sense of changing horses in midstream ?
i 'm going out of my mind , oh , with a pain that stops and starts like a corkscrew to my heart ever since we 've been apart .
