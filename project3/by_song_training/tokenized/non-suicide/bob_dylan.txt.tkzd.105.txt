#bob dylan 's blues

well , the lone ranger and tonto were riding down the line , fixing everybody 's troubles , everybody 's except mine .
someone must 've told them that i was doing fine .
oh , you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads , i got a real gal i 'm loving .
lord , i 'll love her till i 'm dead .
go away from my door and my window too right now .
lord , i be not going down to no racetrack , see no sports car run .
i do n't have no sports car and i do n't even care to have one .
i can walk anytime around the block .
well , the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street with my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet .
watch out , so you do n't step on me .
well , look it here , buddy .
you want to be like me ?
pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see .
tell the judge i said it was alright , yeah !
