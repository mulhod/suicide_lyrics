#terrible lie

hey god , why are you doing this to me ?
hey god , am i not living up to what i 'm supposed to be ?
why am i seething with this animosity ?
hey god , i think you owe me a great big apology .
terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie .
hey god , i really do n't know what you mean .
hey god , seems like salvation comes only in our dreams .
hey god , i feel my hatred grow all the more extreme .
hey god , can this world really be as sad as it seems ?
terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie .
do n't take it away from me , i need someone to hold on to .
do n't take it away from me , i need someone to hold on to .
hey god , there 's nothing left for me to hide .
hey god , i lost my ignorance , security and pride .
hey god , i 'm all alone in a world you must despise .
hey god , i believed your promises , your promises and lies .
terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie , terrible lie .
you made me throw it all away , my morals left to decay .
how many you betray .
you 've taken everything
my head is filled with disease .
my skin is begging you please .
i 'm on my hands and knees
i want so much to believe .
i give you everything .
my sweet everything .
