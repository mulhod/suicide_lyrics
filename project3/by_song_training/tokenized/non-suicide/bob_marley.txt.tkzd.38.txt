#she 's gone

my woman is gone , woman is gone .
my woman is gone , woman is gone .
she had left me a note hanging on my door .
she say she could n't take it , she could n't take any more .
the pressure around me , just could n't see .
she felt like a prisoner who needs to be free .
fools have tried , yeah , wisemen have failed .
oh , listen to me , honey .
life could never be another jail .
still we know now .
we 'll never see smoke without fire , and everyone you see has a heart desire .
she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , ye-ah !
oh , mockingbird , have you ever heard words that i never heard ?
oh , mockingbird , have you ever heard words that i never heard ?
she made it through the exit .
she just could n't take it .
she made it through the exit .
she just could n't make it .
and , oh , my children , if you see me crying my woman is gone .
if you see me , if you see me , if you see me , if you see me crying , if you see me , if you see me , if you see me , if you see me crying she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , ye-ah !
oh , mockingbird , have you ever heard words that i never heard ?
oh , mockingbird , have you ever heard words that i never heard ?
she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , she 's gone .
she 's gone , she 's gone .
