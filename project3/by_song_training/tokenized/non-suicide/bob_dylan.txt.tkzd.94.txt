#hazel

hazel , dirty-blonde hair , i would n't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere .
you got something i want plenty of , ooh , a little touch of your love .
hazel , stardust in your eye , you 're going somewhere and so am i .
i 'd give you the sky high above , ooh , for the touch of your love .
oh , no , i do n't need any reminder to know how much i really care .
but it 's just making me blinder and blinder because i 'm up on a hill and still you 're not there .
hazel , you called and i came .
now , do n't make me play this waiting game .
you got something i want plenty of , ooh , a little touch of your love .
