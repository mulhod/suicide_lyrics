#buckets of rain

buckets of rain , buckets of tears , got all them buckets coming out of my ears .
buckets of moonbeams in my hand .
you got all the love , honey baby , i can stand .
i been meek and hard like an oak .
i 've seen pretty people disappear like smoke .
friends will arrive .
friends will disappear .
if you want me , honey baby , i 'll be here .
i like the smile in your fingertips .
i like the way that you move your hips .
i like the cool way you look at me .
everything about you is bringing me misery .
little red wagon , little red bike , i be not no monkey , but i know what i like .
i like the way you love me strong and slow .
i 'm taking you with me , honey baby , where i go .
life is sad .
life is a bust .
all you can do is do what you must .
you do what you must do and you do it well .
i do it for you .
honey baby , ca n't you tell ?
