#i dreamed i saw st . augustine

i dreamed i saw saint augustine alive as you or me , tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery with a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold , searching for the very souls whom already have been sold .
"arise , arise ! " he cried so loud with a voice without restraint .
" come out , ye gifted kings and queens , and hear my sad complaint !
no martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own .
but , go on your way accordingly , but know you 're not alone . "
i dreamed i saw saint augustine alive with fiery breath and i dreamed i was amongst the ones that put him out to death .
oh , i awoke in anger , so alone and terrified .
i put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried .
