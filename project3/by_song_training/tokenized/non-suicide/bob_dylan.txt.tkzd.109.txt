#oxford town

oxford town , oxford town , everybody 's got their heads bowed down .
sun do n't shine above the ground .
aing . going down to oxford town .
he went down to oxford town .
guns and clubs followed him down all because his face was brown .
better get away from oxford town .
oxford town around the bend .
come to the door , he could n't get in all because of the color of his skin .
what do you think about that , my friend ?
me and my gal , my gal 's son , we got met with a tear-gas bomb .
i do n't even know why we come .
going back where we come from .
oxford town in the afternoon , wverybody singing a sorrowful tune .
two men died beneath the mississippi moon .
somebody better investigate soon .
