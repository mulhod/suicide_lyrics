# the downward spiral

he could n't believe how easy it was .
he put the gun into his face .
bang !
so much blood from such a tiny little hole .
problems do have solutions , you know .
a lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash .
everything 's blue .
everything 's blue in this world .
the deepest shade of mushroom blue .
all fuzzy , spilling out of my head .
