#Live Before You Die

When pressures up, and the stress is high, and I want to bid this world good bye, I'm going to bury my frustrations, grab some of life's satisfactions, yeah, I'm going to live before I die.
I try to find some peace of mind when my life's treating me unkind.
Pain will be my motivation.
I'm going to use my imagination.
yeah, I'm going to live before I die.
So close your eyes, and embrace your memories.
leave your troubles and your worries far behind.
stop contemplating and start celebrating.
yeah, you got to live before you die.
I think of chances I didn't take.
i try to learn from my mistakes, yeah.
I'm tired of being pushed around now.
life be not going to drag me down now.
yeah, I'm going to live before I die.
So close your eyes, and embrace your memories.
leave your troubles and your worries far behind.
stop contemplating and start celebrating.
yeah, you got to live before you die.
