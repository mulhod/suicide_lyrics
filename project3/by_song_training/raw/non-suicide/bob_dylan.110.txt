#Corrina, Corrina

Corrina, Corrina, gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina, gal, where you been so long?
I been worrying about you, baby.
Baby, please come home.
I got a bird that whistles.
I got a bird that sings.
I got a bird that whistles.
I got a bird that sings.
But I be not got Corrina.
Life don't mean a thing.
Corrina, Corrina, gal, you're on my mind.
Corrina, Corrina, gal, you're on my mind.
I was sitting down, thinking of you.
I just can't keep from crying.
