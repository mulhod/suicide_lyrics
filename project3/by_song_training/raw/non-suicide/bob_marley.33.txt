#Turn your lights down low

Turn your lights down low and pull your window curtains.
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in, into our life again.
Saying: Ooh, it's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time.
I kept this message for you, girl, but it seems I was never on time.
Still I wanna get through to you, girlie, on time, on time.
I want to give you some love, good, good loving.
I want to give you some good, good loving, good, good loving.
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I say, I want to give you some good, good loving, good, good loving.
Turn your lights down low.
Never try to resist, oh, no!
Oh, let my love come tumbling in, into our life again.
Saying: Ooh, I love you, and I want you to know right now.
I love you, and I want you to know right now.
because I, that I, I want to give you some love, oh, ooh!
I want to give you some good, good loving.
Oh, I, I want to give you some love.
Saying: I want to give you some good, good loving.
Turn your lights down low, whoa, oh!
Never, never try to resist, oh no!
Ooh, let my love, ooh, let my love come tumbling in, into our life again.
Oh, I want to give you some good, good loving, good, good loving.
