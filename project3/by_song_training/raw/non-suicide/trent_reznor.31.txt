#Dead Souls

Someone take these dreams away that point me to another day.
A duel of personalities that stretch all true reality.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
When figures from the past stand tall, and mocking voices ring the hall.
Imperialistic house of prayer. 
Conquistadors who took their share.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
They keep calling me, keep on calling me.
