#Cold Feelings

Uninvited feelings, they come without warning and they stay too long.
I don't want to feel, and if I run they'll be just as strong.
I've been a-waiting, I'm waiting for some kind of sign.
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.
I watch the clock as the second hand slowly goes strolling by.
I don't want to feel, when a loved one's time's come to die.
I've been a-waiting, I'm waiting for some kind of a sign.
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.
Cold feelings in the night.
You know, this feeling just be not right.
And though I try I just can't hide.
Cold feelings in the night.
Look out!
Yeah I got faith, but sometimes fear it just weighs too much.
I don't want to feel, cold winds blowing through me like an empty touch.
I've been a-waiting, I'm waiting for some kind of sign.
I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind.
Cold feelings in the night.
You know, this feeling just be not right.
And though I try I just can't hide.
Cold feelings in the night.
Cold feelings in the night.
Cold feelings in the night.
Cold feelings in the night.
