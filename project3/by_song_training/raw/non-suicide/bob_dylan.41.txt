#On the Road Again

Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks.
your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox.
your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
and you ask why I don't live here.
Honey, do you have to ask?
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" and you tell me, "Santa Claus."
the milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
and you ask why I don't live here.
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Well, I asked for something to eat, I'm hungry as a hog, so I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Then you ask why I don't live here.
Honey, I got to think you're really weird.
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword.
your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
and you ask why I don't live here.
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen.
they're enough to make me cry.
then the mailman comes in.
even he's got to take a side,
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
And you ask why I don't live here.
Honey, how come you don't move?
