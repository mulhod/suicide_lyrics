#Bad Luck

Some people like to gamble, but you, you always lose.
Some people like to rock 'n' roll; you're always singing the blues.
You got to nasty disposition, no one really knows the reason why.
You got to bad, bad reputation.
Gonna hang your head down and cry.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
Thirteen's my lucky number, to you it means stay inside.
Black cat done crossed my path, no reason to run and hide.
You're looking through a cracked mirror, no one really knows the reason why.
Your enemies are getting nearer.
Gonna hang down your head and cry.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
Some people go to church on Sundays, others they pray at home.
You tell them that there be not no God, that they're better off standing alone.
You're always scratching at the eight ball, no one really knows the reason why.
You get to the top and then you fall.
Gonna hang down your head and cry.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
Don't give it to me.
You got bad, bad luck.
Bad, bad luck.
