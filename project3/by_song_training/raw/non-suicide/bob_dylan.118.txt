#North Country Blues

Come gather around, friends, and I'll tell you a tale of when the red iron ore pits run plenty.
but the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches tell you now that the whole town is empty.
In the north end of town, my own children're grown, but I was raised on the other.
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick and I was brought up by my brother.
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door.
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming till one day my brother failed to come home, the same as my father before him.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
My friends, they couldn't've been kinder.
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring to marry John Thomas, a miner.
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good with the lunch bucket filled every season.
What with three babies born, the work was cut down to a half a day's shift with no reason.
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut and the fire in the air, it felt frozen till a man come to speak and he said in one week that number eleven was closing.
They complained in the East they are paying too high.
They say that your ore be not worth digging, that it's much cheaper down in the South American towns, where the miners work almost for nothing.
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted and the room smelled heavy from drinking when the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long as I waited for the sun to go sinking.
I lived by the window as he talked to himself.
This silence of tongues, it was building till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare and I's left alone with three children.
The summer is gone.
the ground's turning cold.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Well, there be not nothing here now to hold them.
