#Down Here (with the Rest of Us)

You work hard now, to put the food on the table.
You're working for the men who don't even know your name.
That's the way that it goes when you're down here with the rest of us.
You might lose now, your beautiful children, your happy home, yeah, and your beautiful wife.
That's the way that it goes when you're down here with the rest of us.
You'll suffer hard now as you bury your loved ones.
You'll suffer hard now when you lose your best friend.
That's the way that it goes when you're down here with the rest of us.
That's the way that it goes and I know how you feel.
No one's immune now, to a world of problems.
No ones exempt now from a world of pain.
That's the way that it goes when you're down here with the rest of us.
I try hard now to do the right thing, yet I wonder why I still do what's wrong.
That's the way that it goes when you're down here with the rest of us.
That's the way that it goes and I know how you feel.
