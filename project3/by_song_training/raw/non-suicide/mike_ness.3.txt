#Diamond in the Rough

Well, I've been up, yeah, and I've been down.
Been kicked around, yeah, this god-forsaken town.
So many faults, so little time, I've got to find my piece of mind, Peace of mind.
I was looking for something, anything at all.
Something to believe in spray-painted on the walls.
I've made mistakes, yeah, I've paid for them too.
What's a poor boy supposed to do?
Then she said, yea, you're like a diamond in the rough.
You're dirty and you're damaged, all you need's a little love.
But inside there's a sparkle that'll light the stars above.
And you'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
There was a time when I could not say I got a reason to live another day.
A discarded treasure, they all passed on by and I can understand the reasons why.
Then she said, yea, you're like a diamond in the rough.
You're dirty and you're damaged, all you need's a little love.
But inside there's a sparkle that'll light the stars above.
You'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
Then she said, yeah, you're like a diamond in the rough.
You're dirty and you're damaged, all you need's a little love.
But inside there's a sparkle that'll light the stars above.
And you'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
Yea, yea, diamond in the rough.
Yea, yea, going to light the stars above.
Yea, yea, all you need's a little love.
You'll be there in the morning when the going gets tough.
Diamond in the rough now. 
Yea, yea who'll light the stars above now. 
Yea, yea all you need's a little love now, yea, yea, yea, yea.
