#Better Version Of Me

The nickel dropped when I was on my way beyond the Rubicon.
What did I do?
And of the games that I can handle, none are ones worth the candle.
What should I do?
I'm a frightened, fickle person fighting, crying, kicking, cursing.
What should I do?
Oooh, after all the folderol, and hauling over coals stops, what will I do?
Can't take a good day without a bad one.
Don't feel just to smile until I've had one.
Where did I learn?
I make a fuss about a little thing.
The rhyme is losing to the riddling.
Where's the turn?
I don't want a home; I'd ruin that.
Home is where my habits have a habitat.
Why give it a turn?
Oh, after all the folderol, and hauling over coals stops what did I learn?
I am likely to miss the main eventif I stop to cry or complain again, so I will keep a deliberate pace, let the damned breeze dry my face.
Oh, mister, wait until you see what I'm going to be.
I've got a plan, a demand, and it just began, and if you're right, you'll agree.
Here's coming a better version of me.
Here it comes a better version of me.
Here it comes a better version of me.
