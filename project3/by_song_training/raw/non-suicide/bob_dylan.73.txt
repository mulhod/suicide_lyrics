#Country Pie

Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe, oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day.
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime.
what do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum.
call me for dinner.
honey, I'll be there.
Saddle me up my big, white goose.
tie me on her and turn her loose.
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
I don't need much.
that be not no lie.
be not running any race.
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face.
Shake me up that old peach tree.
little Jack Horner got nothing on me.
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
