#Survivalism

I should have listened to her.
So hard to keep control.
We kept on eating but our bloated belly's still not full.
She gave us all she had, but we went and took some more.
Can't seem to shut her legs.
Our mother nature is a whore.
I got my propaganda.
I got revisionism.
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
All a part of this great nation.
I got my fist.
I got my plan.
I got survivalism.
Hypnotic sound of sirens echoing through the street. 
The cocking of the rifles, the marching of the feet.
You see your world on fire.
Don't try to act surprised.
We did just what you told us.
Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies.
I got my propaganda. 
I got revisionism.
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
All a part of this great nation.
I got my fist.
I got my plan.
I got survivalism.
All bruised and broken, bleeding, she asked to take my hand.
I turned, just keep on walking, but you'd do the same thing in the circumstance.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I got my propaganda. 
I got revisionism.
I got my violence in hi-def ultra-realism.
All a part of this great nation.
I got my fist.
I got my plan.
I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
You got your pacifism; I got survivalism.
I got survivalism.
