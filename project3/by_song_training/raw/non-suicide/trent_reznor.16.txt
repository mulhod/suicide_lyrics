#Ringfinger

Well you've got me working so heard lately.
Working my hands until they bleed.
If I was twice the man I could be.
I'd still be half of what you need.
Still you lead me and I follow.
Anything you ask you know I'll do.
But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone, and offer it to me.
Well you just left me nailed here hanging like Jesus on the cross.
I'll be dying for your sins.
And aiding to the cause.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone, and offer it to me.
Wrap my eyes in bandages as confessions I see through.
I get everything I want when I get part of you.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone, and offer it to me.
Ringfinger, a promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea.
ringfinger, devil's flesh and bone do something for me.
