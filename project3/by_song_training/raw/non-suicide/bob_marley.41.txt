#Running away

You running, and you running, and you running away.
you running, and you running, and you running away.
you running, and you running, and you running away.
you running, and you running, but you can't run away from yourself.
Can't run away from yourself.
Can't run away from yourself.
Can't run away from yourself.
Can't run away from yourself.
Can't run away from yourself.
You must have done, must have done.
Something wrong, something wrong.
Said: you must have done, must have done, wo, something wrong, something wrong.
Why you can't find the place where you belong?
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, running away.
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, running away.
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, running away.
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, running away.
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, running away.
Every man thinketh his burden is the heaviest, heaviest.
Every man thinketh his burden is the heaviest, heaviest.
you still mean it. 
Who feels it knows it, Lord.
Who feels it knows it, Lord.
Who feels it knows it, Lord.
Who feels it knows it, Lord.
you running, and you running, and you running away.
you running, and you running, and you running away.
you running, and you running, and you running away.
you running, and you running, but you can't run away from yourself.
Could you run away from yourself?
Can you run away from yourself?
Can't run away from yourself!
Can't run away from yourself!
Yeah, from yourself.
You must have done something, something, something, something, something you don't want nobody to know about.
you must have, Lord.
something, wrong,
What you must have done, you must have done something wrong.
Why you can't find where you belong?
Well, well, well, well, you running away, heh, no.
you running away, ooh, no, no, no.
I'm not running away.
No, don't say that.
Don't say that, because, running away, I'm not running away, ooh! 
Running away.
I've got to protect my life. 
Running away.
And I don't want to live with no strife. 
Running away.
It is better to live on the housetop than to live in a house full of confusion.
Running away.
So, I made my decision and I left you.
Running away.
Now you coming to tell me, running away, that I'm running away. 
Running away.
But it's not true. 
Running away.
I am not running away. 
Running away.
