#Get Gone

How many times do I have to say to get away, get gone.
Flip your shit past another lasses' humble dwelling.
You got your game, made your shot, and you got away with a lot, but I'm not turned on.
So put away that meat you're selling.
'Cause I do know what's good for me, and I've done what I could for you, but you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting singing again, sing, sing, again.
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this?
Am I going to heal from this? 
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I got to get him out.
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.
'Cause I do know what's good for me, and I've done what I could for you, but you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting singing again, sing, sing again.
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this?
Am I going to heal from this? 
He won't admit to it.
Nothing to figure out.
I got to get him out.
It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.
How many times can it escalate till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride, that I'm much obliged to up and go.
I'll idealize, then realize that it's no sacrifice, because the price is paid and there's nothing left to grieve.
Fucking go.
'Cause I've done what I could for you, and I do know what's good for me, and I'm not benefiting, instead I'm sitting singing again, singing again, singing again, sing, sing, sing again.
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this?

Nothing to figure out.

It's time the truth was out that he don't give a shit about me.
How can I deal with this, if he won't get with this?

Nothing to figure out.
