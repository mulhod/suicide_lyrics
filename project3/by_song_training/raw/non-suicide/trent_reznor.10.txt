#Sanctified

It's still getting worse after everything I tried.
What if I found a way to wash it all aside?
What if she touches with those fingertips as the words spill out like fire from her lips.
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
Inside you.
Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel as she walks me through the nicest parts of hell.
I still dream of lips I never should have never kissed.
Well she knows exactly what I can't resist
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
Inside you.
I'm just caught up in another of her spells.
While she's turning me into someone else.
Everyday I hope and pray this will end,  but when I can I do it all again.
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her.
If she says give it all, I'll give everything to her.
I am justified. 
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
Inside you.
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified. 
Inside you.
