#Born to Lose 

I was brought in this world 1962, I didn't have much choice you see.
But by the time I was eight, I could tell it was too late, I was already barking up the wrong tree.
When I was in school, you thought I was a fool, in trouble, breaking all the rules.
I was absent from class, my daddy spanked my bare ass, but I sure tried hard to be cool.
Born to lose, was what they said, you know I was better off dead.
Born to lose, you're just bad news, you don't get a second chance.
It was a hot summer night in mid July, a hangover and a black eye.
Your momma said I was a loser, a dead end cruiser, and deep inside I know that she was right.
Born to lose, was what they said, you know I was better off dead.
Born to lose, you're just bad news, you don't get a second chance.
I tried to get myself a job because that's the way that things are, want to have nice things and go far. 
Well I'm sorry honey, I be not got much money, but I can sure play this here old
Guitar. 
As the years went on, I made a few mistakes it was a troublebound for this young Man.
The police knocking at my door, "Well he don't live here no more, and he's playing in a rock 'n' roll band."
Born to lose, was what they said, you know I was better off dead.
Born to lose, you're just bad news, you don't get a second chance.
