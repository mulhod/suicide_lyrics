#A Place in my Heart

I saw her today, oh God I miss her smile.
A pleasant memory of things in life worthwhile, the things worthwhile.
We used to walk, and we used to talk.
We used to laugh, and we used to cry.
And there will always be a place in my heart for her.
I thought of her today, of years together spent.
A pleasant memory of places that we went, the places we went.
We used to walk, and we used to talk.
We used to laugh, and we used to cry.
And there will always be a place in my heart for her.
