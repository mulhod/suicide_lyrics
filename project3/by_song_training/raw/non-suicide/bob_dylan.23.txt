#Fourth Time Around

When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf as she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget.
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I stood there and hummed.
I tapped on her drum.
I asked her, "How come?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit.
then she said, "Don't get cute."
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs and gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
She threw me outside.
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway.
she went to get it and I tried to make sense out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, "No, dear."
I said, "Your words aren't clear.
you better spit out your plum."
She screamed till her face got so red.
then she fell on the floor and I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And you, you took me in.
you loved me then.
you never wasted time,
And I, I never took much.
I never asked for your crutch.
now, don't ask for mine.
