#Restless Farewell

Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend, be it mine right or wrongfully, I let it slip gladly to my friends to tie up the time most forcefully.
But the bottles are done, we've killed each one, and the table's full and overflowed, and the corner sign says it's closing time, so I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched, I did not do it harmfully and every girl that ever I've hurt, I did not do it knowingly.
But to remain as friends you need the time to make amends and stay behind and, since my feet are now fast and point away from the past, I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Oh, every foe that ever I faced, the cause was there before we came and every cause that ever I fought, I fought it full without regret or shame.
But the dark does die as the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes must meet the dawn and, if I see the day, I'd only have to stay, so I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind, I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung, but it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes, it's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But the time be not tall, yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed by no special friend and, though the line is cut, it be not quite the end.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time, to disgrace, distract, and bother me and the dirt of gossip blows into my face and the dust of rumors covers me.
But, if the arrow is straight and the point is slick, it can pierce through dust no matter how thick, so I'll make my stand and remain as I am and bid farewell and not give a damn.
