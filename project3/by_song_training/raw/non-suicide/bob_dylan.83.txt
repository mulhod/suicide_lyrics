#One More Weekend

Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run, I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Come on down to my ship, honey.
ride on deck,
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
We'll fly the night away, hang out the whole next day.
Things will be OK.
you wait and see.
We'll go someplace unknown, leave all the children home.
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood, I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
yes, you will!
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm going to find you yet.
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever going to get.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
