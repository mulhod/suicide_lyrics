#Don't Think Twice, It's Alright

Well, it be not no use to sit and wonder why, babe, if you don't know by now.
And it be not no use to sit and wonder why, babe.
It'll never do, somehow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn, look out your window and I'll be gone.
You're the reason I'm traveling on, but don't think twice.
it's alright.
And it be not no use in turning on your light, babe, the light I never knowed.
And it be not no use in turning on your light, babe.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
But I wish there was something you would do or say to try and make me change my mind and stay, but we never did too much talking anyway.
But don't think twice.
it's alright.
So, it be not no use in calling out my name, gal, like you never done before.
And it be not no use in calling out my name, gal.
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
I once loved a woman, a child, I am told.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
But don't think twice.
it's alright.
So long, honey babe.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Goodbye's too good a word, babe, so I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I be not saying you treated me unkind.
You could've done better, but I don't mind.
You just kind of wasted my precious time, but don't think twice.
it's alright.
