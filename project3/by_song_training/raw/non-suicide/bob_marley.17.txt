#I shot the sheriff

I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy, oh, no, oh!
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah! 
All around in my home town, they're trying to track me down.
They say they want to bring me in guilty for the killing of a deputy, for the life of a deputy.
But I say: Oh, now, now, oh, I shot the sheriff, the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, yeah!
I say: I shot the sheriff, oh, Lord, and they say it is a capital offense, yeah, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, yeah!
Sheriff John Brown always hated me, for what, I don't know.
Every time I plant a seed, he said kill it before it grow, he said kill them before they grow.
And so, read it in the news.
I shot the sheriff, oh, Lord, but I swear it was in self-defense.
Where was the deputy, ooh, ooh, oh?
I say, I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense, yeah!
Freedom came my way one day, and I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown aiming to shoot me down, so I shot, I shot, I shot him down. 
And I say: If I am guilty I will pay.
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy.
I didn't shoot no deputy, oh, no, oh, oh, no!
I shot the sheriff. 
I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh, oh, oh, ooh.
Reflexes got the better of me, and what is to be must be.
Every day the bucket go a well, one day the bottom go drop out, one day the bottom go drop out.
I say: I, I, I, I shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shoot the deputy. 
Yeah, I, I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah, no, yeah!
