#Duppy conqueror

Yes, me friend, we deh a street again.
Yes, me friend, me good friend, them say we free again.
The bars could not hold me.
Force could not control me now.
They try to keep me down, yeah!
But Jah put I around, yeah!
Yes, I've been accused many a times, and wrongly abused, now, oh, but through the powers of the Most-I, they've got to turn me loose, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh! 
Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now.
I've got to reach Mount Zion, the highest region.
So if you a bull-bucka, let me tell you this, I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror, oh, yeah!
