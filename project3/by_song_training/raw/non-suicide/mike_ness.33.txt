#Sometimes I Do

Sometimes I like you and sometimes I don't, I feel like I'm going to and then I won't.
Sometimes I want to live to see a hundred, other times I want to lay down and die.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I'm weak and sometimes I'm strong.
You know that I've loved all along.
Sometimes I'm rich and sometimes I'm poor.
nothing really matters when you're dead on the floor.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I'm hot, and sometimes I'm cold.
Other times I feel like I'm getting old.
Sometimes I'm fast, and sometimes I'm slow.
Other times I don't even want to go.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I laugh, and sometimes I cry.
Other times I sit and wonder why.
Sometimes I'm up, and sometimes I'm down.
Other times I want to blow this town.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.
