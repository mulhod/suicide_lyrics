#I Do Not Want This

I'm losing ground.
You know how this world can beat you down.
I'm made of clay.
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way.
I'm always falling down the same hill.
Bamboo puncturing this skin and nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in.
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face.
If I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
You don't know just how I feel.
I stay inside my bed.
I have lived so many lives all in my head.
Don't tell me that you care.
There really isn't anything now, is there?
You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer, to those who know what it really feels like, to those who've had a taste like that means something.
And oh so sick I am.
And maybe I don't have a choice.
And maybe that is all I have.
And maybe this is a cry for help.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
I do not want this.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
Don't you tell me how I feel.
You don't know just how I feel.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
I want to know everything.
I want to be everywhere.
I want to fuck everyone in the world.
I want to do something that matters.
