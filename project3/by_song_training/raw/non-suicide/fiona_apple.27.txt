#Paper Bag

I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star to pray on, or wish on, or something like that.
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had.
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope, and I believed for a moment that my chances were approaching to be grabbed.
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear.
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag.
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love.
And I went crazy again today, looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope.
Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine, and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope.
I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified.
Come on put a little love here in my void." 
He said "It's all in your head,"
And I said, "So's everything", But he didn't get it.
I thought he was a man But he was just a little boy.
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love.

Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills because I know I'm a mess that he don't want to clean up.
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold.
Hunger hurts, but starving, it works, when it costs too much to love.
