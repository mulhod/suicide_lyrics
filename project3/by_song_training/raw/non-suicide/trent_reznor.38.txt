#My Violent Heart

You and I, we may look the same, but we are very far apart.`
There's bullet holes where my compassion used to be, and there is violence in my heart.
Into fire you can send us.
From the fire we return.
You can label us a consequence of how much you have to learn.
You can try but, you'll never understand.
This is something you will never understand.
Can you hear it now?
Hear it coming now.
Can you hear it now?
On hands and knees, we crawl.
You can not stop us all.
Our bones, our skin.
We will not let you in.
You have set something in motion, now.
Much greater than you've ever known.
Standing there in all your grand naivety, about to reap what you have sown.
Time will feed upon your weaknesses, and soon you'll lose the will to care.
When you return to the place that you call home, we will be there. 
We will be there.
On hands and knees, we crawl.
You can not stop us all.
Our blood will stain.
We will not go away.
On hands and knees, we crawl.
You can not stop us all.
Our blood, our ways will never leave this place.
