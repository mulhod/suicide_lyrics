#Slow Like Honey

You moved like honey in my dream last night.
Yeah, some old fires were burning.
You came near to me and you endeared to me, but you couldn't quit discern me.
Does that scare you?
I'll let you run away, but your heart will not oblige you.
You'll remember me like a melody.
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you.
And my big secret: going to win you over, slow like honey, heavy with mood.
I'll let you see me.
I'll covet your regard.
I'll invade your demeanor, and you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze.
And you'll wonder what it is about me.
It's my big secre: keeping you coming, slow like honey, heavy with mood.
Though dreams can be deceiving, like faces are to hearts, they serve for sweet relieving when fantasy and reality lie too far apart.
So I stretch myself across like a bridge, and I pull you to the edge and stand there waiting, trying to attain the end to satisfy the story.
Shall I release you?
Must I release you as I rise to meet my glory?
But my big secret, going to hover over your life, going to keep you reaching, when I'm gone like yesterday, when I'm high like heaven, when I'm strong like music, because I'm slow like honey, and heavy with mood.
