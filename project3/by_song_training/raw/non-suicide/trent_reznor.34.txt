#The Good Soldier

Gun fire in the street where we used to meet echos out a beat, and the bass goes...
Bomb, right over my head, step over the dead.
Remember what you said, you know, the part about life is just a waking dream, well I know what you mean, but that be not how it seems right here right now.
How can all this be real?
I can barely feel anymore.
I am trying to see.
I am trying to believe.
This is not where I should be.
I am trying to believe.
Blood hardens in the sand.
Cold metal in my hand may help you understand the way that things are going to be.
There's nowhere else to hide cause god is on our side, I keep telling myself.
I am trying to see.
I am trying to believe.
This is not where I should be.
I am trying to believe.
