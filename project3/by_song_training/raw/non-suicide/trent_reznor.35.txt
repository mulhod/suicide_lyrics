#Vessel

I let you put it in my mouth.
I let it get under my skin.
I let you pump it through my veins.
I let you take me from within.
They tell you what we can and cannot do.
Same thing we've heard a hundred times before.
When I put you inside of me, none of that matters anymore.
My god, can I go any faster?
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here.
I am you, and you are me.
We will never be alone.
I have finally found my place in everything.
I have finally found my home.
I can leave all of this flesh behind.
I can see right through this whole facade.
I am becoming something else.
I am turning into God.
My god can I go any faster?
Oh my god, I don't think I can last here.
