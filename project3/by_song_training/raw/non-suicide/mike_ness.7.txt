#Still Alive

Well, I remember when we were young and you said that I was done.
Well, I walked the long boulevard my head hanging down.
And the word out on the street I was back up on my feet;
I was fighting the same old wars had to even up the scores.
And I'm still alive, and I will survive.
I can take what life's got to give just need a little time.
And I'm still alive, talking that some ol' jive.
I can handle what comes my way, just gimme another day.
And the times have changed my friend.
I'll be here to the bitter end.
With a guitar in my hand, I stand a little taller.
And I've been to hell and back,
I be not falling off this track.
From the back to the front page, from the gutter to the stage.
And I'm still alive and I will survive.
I can take what life's got to give just need a little time.
And I'm still alive, talking that some ol' jive.
I can handle what comes my way just gimme another day.
And from town to town I roam, take me so very far from home.
And I woke up one summer day and I fell in love.
And the times have changed, my friend.
I'll be here to the bitter end.
And I'm here to make my stand.
With a guitar in my hand.
And I'm still alive and I will survive.
I can take what life's got to give just need a little time.
And I'm still alive, talking that some ol' jive.
I can handle what comes my way just gimme another day, another day.
