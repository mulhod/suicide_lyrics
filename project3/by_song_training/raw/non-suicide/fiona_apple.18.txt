#The First Taste

I lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts waiting for the black to replace my blue.
I do not struggle in your web because it was my aim to get caught.
But daddy longlegs, I feel that I'm finally growing weary of waiting to be consumed by you.
Give me the first taste.
Let it begin.
Heaven cannot wait forever.
Darling, just start the chase.
I'll let you win, but you must make the endeavour.
Oh, your love gives me a heart confusion.
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red.
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion.
I'm building memories on things we have not said.
Full is not heavy as empty, not nearly my love, not nearly my love, not nearly.
Give me the first taste.
Let it begin.
Heaven cannot wait forever.
Darling, just start the chase.
I'll let you win, but you must make the endeavour.
