#Physical (You're So)

I want to take you baby.
I want to take you out.
I want to wine and dine you.
Oh, I want to twist, and twist and shout.
I want you hot in my arms.
So soft on my bed.
You get the key to my heart, oh, when you wear that sweet dress.
But you're too physical, physical to me.
You're just too physical, physical no to me.
I want your rough house baby.
I want this right in your ear.
You let me feel your danger.
I let you make this feeling clear here.
I want the touch of your charms, the heat of your breath.
I want to say all those things that would be better unsaid.
But you're too physical, physical to me.
You're just too physical, oh.
You're too physical for me.
You're too physical to me.
You're really just just too just too really, fuck no!
You're just too physical.
You're just too physical. 
Too fucking physical.
No, no no no no no no.
Oh you're too physical.
Just too physical.
Just too.
