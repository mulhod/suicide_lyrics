#I'll Be Your Baby Tonight

Close your eyes.
close the door.
You don't have to worry anymore.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Shut the light.
shut the shade.
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Well, that mockingbird's going to sail away.
we're going to forget it.
That big, fat moon is going to shine like a spoon, but we're going to let it.
you won't regret it.
Kick your shoes off.
do not fear.
Bring that bottle over here.
I'll be your baby tonight.
