#King of Fools

I was born a King of Fools.
Most people think I'm just a playboy breaking rules.
But they don't know that when it comes around to love, I always lose.
That's why I call myself the King of Fools.
I was born never to care, but now I want to love that I can share.
I've searched in vain for a love that would never be true.
That's why I call myself the King of Fools.
King of Fools, King of Fools, when it comes around your love, I always lose.
I was born without one good thought.
Just to live fast, tell a lie and break a heart.
I have broken many hearts and I've broken many rules.
That's why I call myself the King of Fools.
I was born the King of Fools.
At any other game I never lose.
But when it comes around to love, that's when I realize: I was born the King of Fools.
King of Fools, King of Fools, at any other game I never lose.
King of Fools, King of Fools, when it comes around your love, I always lose.
