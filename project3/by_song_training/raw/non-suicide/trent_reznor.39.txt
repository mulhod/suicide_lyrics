#The Warning

Some say it was a warning.
Some say it's a sign.
I was standing right there when it came down from the sky.
The way it spoke to us, you felt it from inside.
Said it was up to us, up to us to decide.
"You've become a virus, killing off his host.
We been watching you with all our eyes and what you seem to value most.
So much potential, or so we used to say.
Your greed, self-importance, and your arrogance, you piss it all away.
We heard her cry.
We have come to intervene.
You will change your ways and you will make amends, or we will wipe this place clean!"
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away.
Your time is tick, tick, ticking away, ticking away.
