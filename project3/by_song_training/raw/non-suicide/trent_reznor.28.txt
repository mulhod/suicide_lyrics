#The Downward Spiral

He couldn't believe how easy it was.
He put the gun into his face.
Bang!
So much blood from such a tiny little hole.
Problems do have solutions, you know.
A lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash.
Everything's blue.
Everything's blue in this world.
The deepest shade of mushroom blue.
All fuzzy, spilling out of my head.
