#Knocking on Heaven's Door

Mama, take this badge off of me.
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see.
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door.
Mama, put my guns in the ground.
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long, black cloud is coming down.
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door, knock knock knocking on heaven's door.
