#Down on the World Again

This be not the way it's supposed to be, there's a dark cloud following me.
I'm disillusioned and I'm down on the world again.
There's movies going on in my head and all I can see is the color red.
I'm relentless and I'm down on the world again.
Give me tomorrow's broken dreams now.
I'm feeling like a loaded gun.
There's a world of guilt written on my face, and I feel ashamed for the human race.
I've been forsaken, and I'm down on the world again.
Well, I feel so alone in this crowd. 
My thoughts of despair are getting loud.
I'm disrespected and I'm down on the world again.
Love and tolerance have abandoned me, and I feel the gloom hovering over me.
I'm resentful, and I'm down on the world again.
Give me tomorrow's broken dreams now.
I'm feeling like a loaded gun.
Give me tomorrow's holy schemes now, so hopeless when there's no place left to run.
Well, I tried to play for the higher stakes.
You won't let me forget my mistakes.
I'm unforgiven, and I'm down on the world again.
This be not the way it's supposed to be. 
There's a dark cloud following me.
I'm distorted, and I'm down on the world again.
