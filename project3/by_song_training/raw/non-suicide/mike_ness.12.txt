#Nickels and Dimes

I'm a Cadillac tramp at the end of his road.
A swap meet rat who's sitting on gold, yeah baby.
I'm a guitar gangster without a tune.
I'm the baseball bat that's waiting to swing.
Your loan shark friend with the broken knees, yeah baby.
I'm a penthouse pauper with nothing to lose.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm chasing Nickles and Dimes.
The rest of the world passes me by.
Nah, Nah, Nah, Im just wasting my time.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
I'm the high rolling creep that's in too deep with the slicked back hair and the silver teeth, yeah baby.
I'm a vagabond king with a stolen crown.
I'm a jailhouse poet, a genius, a fool, I'm the pimp who lost his cool, yeah baby.
I've got first class taste in a second class town.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm chasing Nickles and Dimes.
The rest of the world passes me by.
Nah, Nah, Nah, Im just wasting my time.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
Yeah.
I'm a loaded gun that pointed at the mirror.
A drugstore cowboy whose end is near, yeah baby.
I'm a big time schemer with broken down dreams.
I'm a derelict rebel without a cause.
I be not the cat with the sharpest claws, no baby.
Cause sometimes life just be not what it seems.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm chasing Nickles and Dimes.
The rest of the world passes me by.
Nah, Nah, Nah, Im just wasting my time.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
I'm just sitting here and wondering why.
And just like you, I'm wondering why.
