Hearts fail.
young hearts fail anytime pressurized, overheat, overtired.
Take it quick.
take it neat.
Clasp your hands.
touch your feet.
Take it quick.
take it neat.
Hearts fail.
young hearts fail anytime wearing down, on the run, underground.
Put your hand where it's safe.
Leave your hand where it's safe.
Do it again.
Do it again and again and again.
Anytime, that's your right.
Told you we should do it again.
Overheat, overtired.
Don't you wish to do it again?
Anytime, that's all right.
Don't you wish to do it again?
I bet you wish you do it again, do it again.
