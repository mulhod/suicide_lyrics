#Song for a Lost Friend

You had a dream.
You know you dreamt so much.
You had a dream.
You know it meant so much.
You're just a victim of the circumstance.
I mean, what else could you do?
You saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true.
What could you do?
You had a goal.
You know you aimed so high.
You had soul.
You knew you had to try.
You're just a victim of the time of day.
No matter what you say or do, you saw your dream and you just took a play and for a while your dream came true.
What could you do?
What could you do?
You're just a victim of the circumstance.
I mean, what else could you do?
You saw your dream and you just took a chance and for a while your dream came true.
What could you do?
What could you do?
What could you do?
What could you do?
