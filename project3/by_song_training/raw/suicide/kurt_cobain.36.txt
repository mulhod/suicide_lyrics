#Stay Away

Monkey see.
monkey do.
I don't know why I'd rather be dead than cool.
I don't know why every line ends in rhyme.
I don't know why less is more, love is blind.
I don't know why.
Stay, stay away, stay away, stay away.
Give an inch.
take a smile.
I don't know why fashion shits fashion-style.
I don't know why.
throw it out and keep it in.
I don't know why.
have to have poison skin.
I don't know why
Stay, stay away, stay away, stay away.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Stay, stay away, stay away, stay away.
Monkey see.
monkey do.
I don't know why I'd rather be dead than cool.
I don't know why every line ends in rhyme.
I don't know why less is more, love is blind.
I don't know why.
Stay, stay away, stay away, stay away.
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Stay, stay away, stay away, stay away.
Stay away, stay away, stay away.
God is gay!
