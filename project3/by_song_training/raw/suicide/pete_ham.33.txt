#Dennis

Deeper waters flowed.
Recently it showed.
Trying to cover your head.
Trying to frighten you.
Trying to fight with you.
Really getting you scared.
But don't you worry, you love of mine.
Pretty soon it will all be fine and we'll just go on, higher hills to climb, climbing all the time, trying to find a way through, falling down again on the ground again, wondering what you can do.
But don't you worry, you love of ours.
They look like weeds, but they're really flowers and they'll soon be gone.
You won't stand up.
you won't sit down.
Your head's a mile above the ground.
And, though we tend to scold you now, I couldn't start to tell you how, we couldn't start to tell you how there's just no way to say how much we love you, you, little Dennis, you.
You're full of new surprise.
Love you.
You, little Dennis with the rascal in your eyes, you're a prize.
It could be bad.
it could be worse.
You're taking out your mother's purse.
And, though you cried when you got told the money there was for the old to keep their dogs from getting cold, the only thing that can't be sold is love.
You, little Dennis, you, you're full of new surprise.
Love you.
You, little Dennis with the rascal in your eyes.
Will you pick up your toys?
Will you be a good boy?
Will you please, please?
There's a way.
There's a way.
If you'll play, if you'll stay, there's a way through.
There's a way to take away blue, take away blue.
There's a way.
There's a way.
If you'll play, if you'll stay, there's a way through, there's a way to.
