#Talking to Mary

talking to mary, you know you don't have to shout.
she can hear what you're thinking like you're saying it right out loud.
she sees behind that dirty look.
it was her that followed down every stupid turn that you took.
one day she'll go.
i told you so.
one day she'll go.
i told you so.
saw the one big problem you keep under your hat and it's pretty unlikely that anybody else would be cool with that.
you got bus fare in your pocket and more money down in your sock, but she can't tell you how to contact her if you won't listen to her talk.
one day she'll go.
i told you so.
one day she'll go.
i told you so.
it's no problem.
i'll just keep quiet if it's easier for you to make believe in that i don't love you as much as i do.
one day she'll go.
i told you so.
one day she'll go.
i told you so.
i told you so.
i told you so.
