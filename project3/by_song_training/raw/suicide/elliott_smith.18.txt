#Coming Up Roses

i'm a junkyard full of false starts and i don't need your permission to bury my love under this bare lightbulb.
the moon is a sickle cell.
it'll kill you in time.
you cold, white brother riding your blood like spun glass in sore eyes while the moon does its division.
you're buried below and you're coming up roses.
everywhere you go red roses follow.
the things that you tell yourself, they'll kill you in time.
you cold white brother alive in your blood, spinning in the night sky while the moon does its division.
you're buried below and you're coming up roses.
everywhere you go red roses.
so you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows and you're coming up roses.
everywhere you go red roses.
