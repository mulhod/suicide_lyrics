#Iron Lady

Have you seen the iron lady's charms, legs of steel, leather on her arms, taking on a man to die?
A life for a life.
an eye for an eye.
And death's the iron lady in the chair.
Stop the murder.
deter the crimes away.
Only killing shows that killing doesn't pay.
Yes, that's the kind of law it takes even though we make mistakes and sometimes send the wrong man to the chair.
In the death-row waiting for their turn, no time to change, not a chance to learn, waiting for someone to call, say, "it's over, after all."
They won't have to face the justice of the chair.
Just before they serve him one last meal, shave his head, they ask him how he feels.
Then the warden comes to say goodbye.
Reporters come to watch him die, watch him as he's strapped into the chair.
And the chaplain, he reads the final prayer.
Be brave, my son.
the Lord is waiting there.
Oh, murder is so wrong, you see.
Both the Bible and the courts agree that the state's allowed to murder in the chair.
In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales.
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals.
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed, the finest lawyers' fees are paid and a rich man never died upon the chair.
Have you seen the iron lady's charms, legs of steel, leather on her arms, taking on a man to die?
A life for a life.
an eye for an eye.
And death's the iron lady in the chair.
