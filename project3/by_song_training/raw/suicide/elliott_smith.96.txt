#Bottle Up and Explode!

bottle up and explode over and over,
keep the troublemaker below.
put it away and check out for the day and in for a round of overexposure, the thing mother nature provides to get up and go.
bottle up and explode, seeing the stars surrounding you, red, white and blue.
you look at him like you've never known him, but i know for a fact that you have.
the last time you cried, who'd you think was inside?
thinking that you were about to come over, but i'm tired now of waiting for you.
you never show.
bottle up and go.
if you're going to hide, it's up to you.
i'm coming through.
bottle up and go.
i can make it outside.
i'll get though becoming you, becoming you, becoming you.
