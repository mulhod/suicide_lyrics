#New Disaster

ghost of your smile is always looking for new bodies to haunt and it's been here, it is up here.
he's hanging around and he'll wait for a while, gradually gone.
it's pleasing and freezing while i wonder what it is you're after, keeping company with this disaster.
you looked all over town, got turned around to walk back through the mud, the kind you had left behind you.
everybody's the same in this long knowing game where every new blood gets time to become resigned.
now i wonder what it is you're after, keeping company with this disaster, why you never try to tame your master.
you just blow through the coals, blow through the coals, blow through the coals till everyone knows that your smile is just a ghost.
the ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park.
it's old news.
you see that it's no use.
you're waiting to start, waiting to light.
wait until dark.
i told you, man.
i told you.
while i wonder what it is you're after, keeping company with this disaster, why you never try to tame your master.
