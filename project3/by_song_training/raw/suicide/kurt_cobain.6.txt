#Paper Cuts

When I'm feeling tired, she pushed food through the door and I crawl towards the crack of light.
Sometimes I can't find my way.
Newspapers spread around, soaking all that they can.
A cleaning is due again, a good hosing down.
The lady whom I feel maternal love for cannot look me in the eyes, but I see hers and they are blue and they cock and twitch and masturbate!
I said so.
I said so.
I said so.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Black windows of paint I scratched with my nails.
I see others just like me.
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones.
They point in my way.
They come with a flash of light and take my family away.
And very later I have learned  to accept some friends of ridicule.
My whole existence is for your amusement and that is why I'm here with you, to take me with.
You're right.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
Nirvana.
