#All Cleaned Out

here comes your pride and joy, the comic little drunk you call your boy making everybody smile, who takes your pretty plan and then becomes a disappearing man after a little while.
i saw you with your makeup running down.
now, what's that all about?
you say you don't want anyone around because you're all cleaned out.
you toss the empty beer not really as composed as you appear, an icicle inside, wearing clothes that clash, wondering, "is this treasure or is this trash?", still trying to decide and about 5 o'clock here comes your clown with the foot he's throwing down.
but all you say is you don't want anyone around.
come not right now.
there be not nothing to dream.
you don't want to think about it.
i'm sorry you seem so stoned and i'm sorry you think you have to hold your tongue when you're so pretty and smart.
i'm seeing you caving in, becoming afraid of all these men that you've given your heart.
i saw you with your makeup running down.
now, what's that all about?
you say you don't want anyone around because you're all cleaned out, all cleaned out, all cleaned out.
