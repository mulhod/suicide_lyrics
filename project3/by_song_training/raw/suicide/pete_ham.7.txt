#Lonely You

When I look into your tearful eyes, I don't know what to do.
And, though you say that I don't realize, I sympathize with you.
lonely you, only you.
Yes, I do.
Lonely you, only you.
Lonely you.
When I ask you just to be my friend, I want to lend a hand, but, if we get too close, it's sure to end.
Oh, can't you understand?
Lonely you, only you.
Yes, it will.
Lonely you, only you.
Lonely you.
We really need a friend and friends are hard to find and harder still to keep.
Lonely you.
Lonely me.
Lonely you, only you.
Yes, it will.
Lonely you, only you.
Lonely you.
Lonely you.
Lonely you.
