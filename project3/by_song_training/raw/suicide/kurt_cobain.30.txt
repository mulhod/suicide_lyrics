#Breed

I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care, care if I'm old.
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
I don't mind.
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind.
Get away.
Get away.
Get away.
Get away.
Get away, away, away from your home.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid, afraid, afraid of a ghost.
Even if you have, even if you need, I don't mean to stare.
We don't have to breed.
We could plant a house.
We could build a tree.
I don't even care.
We could have all three.
