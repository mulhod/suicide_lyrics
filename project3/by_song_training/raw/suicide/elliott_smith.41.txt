#Let's Get Lost

i've been outside, invited in, but i couldn't abide, wouldn't miss it again.
burning every bridge that i cross to find some beautiful place to get lost.
i had true love.
i made it die.
i pushed her away.
she said, please stay.
burning every bridge that i cross to find some beautiful place to get lost, to find some beautiful place to get lost.
well, i don't know where i'll go now and i don't really care who follows me there, but i'll burn every bridge that i cross and find some beautiful place to get lost and find some beautiful place to get lost.
