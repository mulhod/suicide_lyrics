#Tomorrow Tomorrow

everybody knows which way you go, straight to over.
no one wants to see you inside of me, straight to over.
i heard the hammer at the lock say you're deaf and dumb and done.
give yourself another talk.
this time make it sound like someone.
the noise is coming out and, if it's not out now, then tomorrow, tomorrow.
they took your life apart and called you failure's art.
they were wrong, though.
they won't know till tomorrow.
i got static in my head, the reflected sound of everything.
tried to go to where it led, but it didn't lead to anything.
the noise is coming out and, if it's not out now, i know it's just about to drown tomorrow out.
