#Basket in the Pool

Went to a party the other night.
everybody was there.
Thought that I would have some fun as I started up the stair.
Somebody tried to ruin it when he won a raffle prize.
Tried to shake and shock us right before our eyes.
While we danced, while we were dancing, who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
It was filled with the finest cheeses, filled with imported wine.
Wish that I had won it and I wish that it were mine.
I know some wino lives outside of town who would gladly cut your throat if he could drink it down.
While we danced, while we were dancing, who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
If I had found out who he was, if I'd have found his face, next time we have a party going to find out his name.
I've been on the ocean swimming.
know porpoise led the way.
It wasn't worth the matter and it wasn't worth the pay.
We were there, go right on dancing.
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
How can I go swimming now?
My world is laid to waste.
It was the worst of manners and it was the worst of taste.
Why can't we be left alone?
Think that it was a crime.
If everyone was groovy, we could all have a real good time.
We could dance, go right on dancing.
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
