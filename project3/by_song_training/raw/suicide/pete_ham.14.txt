#Knocking Down Our Home

Your heart is in your home, they say.
Your home's where you belong.
but someone stole my heart today, so listen to my song.
I heard the news today.
They're going to move us far away.
Seems that our home must go.
They're going to build a motorway.
It isn't fair.
nobody cares.
They're knocking down our home, Ruining all we own.
They're knocking down our home.
Please help us.
Don't let them take our home.
Ma's cooking at the stove, Where she's cooked for thirty years.
Ten thousand meals she's cooked, But now her eyes are filled with tears.
It isn't fair.
nobody cares.
They're knocking down our home, Ruining all we own.
