#No Love Lost

So long sitting her.
didn't hear the warning.
Waiting for the tape to run.
We've been moving around in different situations, knowing that the time would come, just to see you torn apart, witness to your empty heart.
I need it.
I need it.
I need it.
Through the wire screen, the eyes of those standing outside looked in at her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo.
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument which they had that morning inserted deep into her body.
She shuddered instinctively.
No life at all in the house of dolls.
No love lost.
No love lost.
You've been seeing things in darkness, not in learning, hoping that the truth will pass.
No life underground.
wasting.
never changing.
wishing that this day won't last.
To never see you show your age, to watch until the beauty fades, I need it.
I need it.
I need it.
