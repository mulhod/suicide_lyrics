#Riot Coming

in storyville i fucked a cop amped up on prescription pills that brought my heart to a stop and i want to tell you there's a riot coming like a drug in the water.
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters.
i met a girl on the square who showed me how to kill my cares, but once that's done, man, there's nothing to do.
time's running backwards from me and you.
there's a riot coming like a drug in the water.
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters.
my body's running, but i don't see why it bothers.
sat down and jelled with this friend of mine who'd never close both his eyes, but one was shut all the time to cover the thing he was scared of while he watched with the other.
there was a riot coming like a drug in the water.
a punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters.
there's a riot coming.
there's a riot coming.
there's a riot coming.
