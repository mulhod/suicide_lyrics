#No Name #1

at a party he was waiting, looking kind of spooky and withdrawn, like he could be underwater, the mighty mother with her hundred arms swept all aside.
i hate to walk behind other people's ambition.
i saw you waiting saint-like with your warning.
leave alone.
you don't belong here.
he got nervous, started whistling, every thought a ricochet.
did you notice?
well, i wondered, what's the worst thing i could say?
and i froze up and sighed.
you remind me of someone's daughter.
i forgot her, i forgot her name ashamed.
go home and live with your pain.
leave alone.
leave alone because you know you don't belong.
you don't belong here.
and when i go, don't you follow.
leave alone.
leave alone because you know you don't belong.
you don't belong here.
slip out quiet.
nobody's looking.
leave alone.
you don't belong here.
