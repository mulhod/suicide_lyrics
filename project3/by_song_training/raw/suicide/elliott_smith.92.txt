#Bled White

i'm a color reporter (rose city on the 409), but the city's been bled white (white city on the yellow line).
and the doctor orders (drinking till he's trashed is just a waste of time).
he drinks all night to take away this curse, but it makes me feel much worse.
bled white.
so i wait for the f-train (white city on the yellow line) and connect through a friend of mine (white city to a friend of mine) to a yesterday-dream (yesterday a dream was just a waste of time) because i'll have to be high to track the sunset down and paint this pailing town.
bled white.
so here he comes with a blank expression, especially for me because he knows i feel the same because happy and sad come in quick succession.
i'm never going to become what you became.
don't you dare disturb me (don't complicate my piece of mind) while i'm balancing my past (don't complicate my piece of mind) because you can't help or hurt me (the anger, being mean was just a waste of time) like it already has.
it may not seem quite right, but i'm not fucked, not quite.
bled white.
bled white.
