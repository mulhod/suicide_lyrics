#Shine On

Shine on, shine on me.
All I know is now I want you close to me.
I can't really tell you what the future's going to be.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
Lean on, lean on me.
Something tells me that's the way it's gotta be.
I can't really show you what the future's going to be.
Just for now, little lady, lean on me.
To fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane.
Don't think of tomorrow.
yesterday is past.
And, if you could, you know we could make it last.
Drink on, drink on me.
Slip and slide, so I'll forget reality.
I can't really say if I'll come on and get so free.
Just for now, little lady, drink on me.
To fall in love with love was maybe just a fantasy and promises we made could be insane.
Don't think of tomorrow.
yesterday is past.
And, if you could, you know we could make it last.
Shine on, shine on me.
All I know is now I want you close to me.
I can't really tell you what the future's going to be.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
Just for now, little lady, shine on me.
