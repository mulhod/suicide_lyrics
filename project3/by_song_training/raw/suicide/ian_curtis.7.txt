#Twenty Four Hours

So this is permanence, love's shattered pride, what once was innocence turned on its side. 
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move, deep in the memory of what once was love. 
Oh, how I realized!
how I wanted time!
Put into perspective.
tried so hard to find. 
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way. 
Destiny unfolded.
I watched it slip away. 
Excessive flashpoints, beyond all reach.
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep.
Let's take a ride out.
see what we can find.
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires.
I never realized the lengths I'd have to go, all the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know. 
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call.
Looked beyond the day in hand.
there's nothing there at all. 
Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong, got to find some therapy.
this treatment takes too long. 
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway, got to find my destiny before it gets too late.
