#Midnight Sun

Oh, no, oh, no, I think it's time for me to run.
Well, I've been working all the summer, waiting for the winter to come and, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I think I've been away too long.
Well, I've been coming and I'm going.
All the time is growing with fun and, if you feel like something's missing, well, come into the midnight sun.
Never be a gooseberry for gooseberries should never see it.
Drop the one who's looking at you looking at the one who's seeing you be it.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I think I've been away too long.
Well, I've been waiting all the summer, counting all the trophies I've won and, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
Oh no, oh no, I think it's time for me to run.
Well, I've been working all the summer, waiting for the winter to come and, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
And, if you feel like something's missing, well, come into the midnight sun.
And, if you feel like reminiscing, well, come into the midnight sun.
