#No Name #4

for a change she got out before he hurt her bad, took her records and clothes and pictures of her boy.
it really made her sad.
packed it up and didn't look back.
i'm okay, let's just forget about him.
the car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine.
in her bag i saw things she drew when she was nine, like this one here, her alone, nobody near.
what a shame.
let's just not talk about it.
no, it doesn't look like you, but you did wear cowboy boots.
that's your fame, there's no question about it.
once we got back inside, with one ear to the ground i was ready to hide because i don't know who's around and you look scared.
it's our secret.
do not tell, okay?
let's just not talk about it.
don't tell, okay?
let's just forget all about it.
