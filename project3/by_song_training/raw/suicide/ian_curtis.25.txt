#Ice Age

I've seen the real atrocities, buried in the sand, stockpiled for safety while we stand holding hands.
I'm living in the Ice age.
I'm living in the Ice age.
Nothing will hold.
Nothing will fit into the cold.
It's not an eclipse.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Searching for another way, hide behind the door.
We'll live in holes and disused shafts, hopes for little more.
I'm living in the Ice age.
I'm living in the Ice age.
Nothing will hold.
Nothing will fit into the cold.
No smile on your lips.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
Living in the Ice age.
