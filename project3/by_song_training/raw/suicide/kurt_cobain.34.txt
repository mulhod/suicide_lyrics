#Drain You

One baby to another says, I'm lucky to have met you.
I don't care what you think unless it is about me.
It is now my duty to completely drain you, a travel through a tube, and end up in your infection.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours.
I like you.
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil.
You've taught me everything without a poison apple.
The water is so yellow.
I'm a healthy student, indebted and so grateful.
Vacuum out the fluids.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours.
I like you, you, you, you, you, you.

It is now my duty to completely drain you, a travel through a tube, and end up in your infection.
Chew your meat for you.
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss from my mouth to yours, sloppy lips to lips.
You're my vitamins.
I'm like you.
