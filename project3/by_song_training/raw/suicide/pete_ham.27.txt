#Take It All

In a way, the sun has shone on me.
Makes it easy to make it hard.
Take an inch, take a yard, take it all.
I don't need it at all.
Any day the sun could shine on you.
Makes it silly to make it bad.
Take it good, take it glad, take it all.
Don't you know there's a stronger thing keeping us together?
Don't you know there's a song to sing?
Sing on.
let the feeling take you high.
Don't you know there's a stronger thing keeping us together?
Don't you know there's a song to sing?
Sing on.
let the feeling take you high.
Any day, the sun will shine on you.
Makes it silly to take it bad.
Make it good, take it glad, take it all.
I don't need it at all.
I don't want it at all.
No, no, no.
