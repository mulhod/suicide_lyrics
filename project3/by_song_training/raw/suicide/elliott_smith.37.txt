#Pretty Mary K

almost forgot.
started to say.
rode into the sun, past everyone.
hallelujah, pretty mary k.
i found faith in the infirmary.
there's a soldier lying in bed with a wound to the head, calling out to pretty mary k.
here's what you get for things that haven't happened yet.
i happened upon pretty mary k, but a soldier's uniform waved you away.
i walk round the dock and talk to st. james though i'm already done and ask everyone, "have you seen her, pretty mary k?
have you seen her, pretty mary k?"
