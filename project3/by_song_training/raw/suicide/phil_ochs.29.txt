#What's That I Hear

What's that I hear now ringing in my ear?
I've heard that sound before.
What's that I hear now ringing in my ear?
I hear it more and more.
It's the sound of freedom calling, ringing up to the sky.
It's the sound of the old ways falling.
You can hear it if you try.
You can hear it if you try.
What's that I see now shining in my eyes?
I've seen that light before.
What's that I see now shining in my eyes?
I see it more and more.
It's the light of freedom shining, shining up to the sky.
It's the light of the old ways dying.
You can see it if you try
What's that I feel now beating in my heart?
I've felt that beat before.
What's that I feel now beating in my heart?
I feel it more and more.
It's the rumble of freedom calling, climbing up to the sky.
It's the rumble of the old ways falling.
You can feel it if you try.
