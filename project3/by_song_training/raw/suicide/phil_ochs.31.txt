#One Way Ticket Home

I'd like a one-way ticket home, ticket home, where I can watch television, talk on the telephone.
But every town I wander there's a billboard on a throne.
Ticket home, I want a ticket home.
Does anybody know my name or recognize my face?
I must have come from somewhere, but I can't recall the place.
They dropped me at the matinee.
they left without a trace.
Ticket home, I want a ticket home.
Elvis Presley is the king.
I was at his crowning.
My life just flashed before my eyes.
I must be drowning.
Seems like only yesterday I climbed aboard the plane, raping distance in the skies, while diving in champagne.
I would be in exile now, but everywhere's the same.
