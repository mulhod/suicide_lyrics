Feel it closing in, feel it closing in, the fear of whom I call.
Every time I call I feel it closing in.
I feel it closing in day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out.
I feel it closing in as patterns seem to form.
I feel it cold and warm.
The shadows start to fall.
I feel it closing in.
I feel it closing in day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out.
I'd have the world around to see just whatever happens, stood by the door alone, and then it's fade away.
I see you fade away.
Don't ever fade away.
I need you here today.
Don't ever fade away.
Don't ever fade away.
Don't ever fade away.
Don't ever fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away.
