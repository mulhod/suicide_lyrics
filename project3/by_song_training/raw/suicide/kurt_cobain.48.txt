#Mexican Seafood

All the itchy flakes it is aflaming, all the gels and creams it is pertaining to, a fungus mold cured by injection.
Hope it's only a yeast infection.
Oh, well, it burns when I, it hurts when I pee.
Oh, well, it hurts when I, it hurts when I see.
Now I vomit cum and diarrhoea on the tile floor like oatmeal pizza, fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy puss.
I feel the blood becoming chowder rust.
Oh, well, it burns when I, it hurts when I pee.
Oh, well, it hurts when I, it hurts when I see.
Roll into my bed, which does consist of lice, bugs and fleas and yellow mucus, stained dirt, vaseline, toe-jam and booger, stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge.
