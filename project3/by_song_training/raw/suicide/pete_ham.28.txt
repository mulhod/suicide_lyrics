#Name of the Game

Saw the railway master and I looked him in the eye.
Said, "Would you go much faster if you thought that you would die?"
He said, "Not me, sir.
I could not care.
In fact, I would not try.
Protest would not take me far.
It's different, me not being a star."
I lock my feelings in a jar until another day.
Comfort me, dear brother.
Won't you tell me what you know?
Somewhere in this painful world is a place where I can go.
Oh, long-awaiting mother, is it time to make a show and take your babies to your breast?
No, we never passed the test and all our sins should be confessed before we carry on.
Oh, don't refuse me.
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame.
No, don't confuse me for I know it's the name of the game.
Got up off my pillow and I looked up at the sun.
Said, "You can see quite clearly now the things that we have done."
We burned your sacred willow and our battles we have won, but did we get so very far?
It's different, me not being a star.
Lock my feelings in a jar until we go away.
Oh, don't refuse me.
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame.
No, don't confuse me for I know it's the name of the game.
Oh, don't refuse me.
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame.
No, don't confuse me for I know that's the name of the game.
Don't refuse me.
Don't confuse me.
Oh, oh, oh.
Don't refuse me.
Don't confuse me.
Oh, oh, oh.
