#All Apologies

What else should I be?
All apologies.
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay.
What else could I write?
I don't have the right.
What else should I be?
All apologies.
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one, in the sun, in the sun.
I'm married, buried.
I wish I was like you, easily amused.
Find my nest of salt.
Everything is my fault.
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame.
Sunburn with freezeburn, choking on the ashes of her enemy.
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one, in the sun, in the sun.
Married, Maried, Maried, buried!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
All in all is all we are.
