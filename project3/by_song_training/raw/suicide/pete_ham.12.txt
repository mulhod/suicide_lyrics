#I'm in Love

I'm not well.
can't you tell?
I've never felt like this before.
Very strange, got no pain, but I can't wait to get some more.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
Hold me tight every night.
Never go away from me.
Say you will love me still.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
Where have you been all my life?
I'd like to make us man and wife
What about a house just for us?
See the children on the bus.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
I'm in love and you taught me what this thing is all about.
I'm in love and you taught me.
Now you're all I'm thinking of.
