#I Better Be Quiet Now

wish you gave me your number.
wish i could call you today, just to hear a voice.
i got a long way to go.
i'm getting further away.
if i didn't know the difference, living alone'd probably be ok.
it wouldn't be lonely.
i got a long way to go.
i'm getting further away.
a lot of hours to occupy, it was easy when i didn't know you yet, things i'd have to forget, but i better be quiet now.
i'm tired of wasting my breath, carrying on, and getting upset.
maybe i got a problem, but that's not what i wanted to say.
i'd prefer to say nothing.
i got a long way to go.
i'm getting further away.
had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place while a dead enemy screams in my face, but i better be quiet now.
i'm tired of wasting my breath, carrying on, not over it yet.
wish i knew what you're doing and why you want to do it this way, so i can't go the distance.
i got a long way to go.
i'm getting further away.
i got a long way to go.
i'm getting further away.
