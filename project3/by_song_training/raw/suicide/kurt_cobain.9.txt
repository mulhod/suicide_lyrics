#Swap Meet

They lead a lifetime that is comfortable.
They travel far to keep their stomachs full.
They make their living off of arts and crafts, the kind with seashells, driftwood, and burlap.
They make a deal when they come to town.
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground.
She loves him more than he will ever know.
He loves her more than he will ever show.
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart.
Keeps her photographs close to her heart.
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart.
