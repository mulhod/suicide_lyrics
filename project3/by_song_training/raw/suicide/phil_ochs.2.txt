#The Ballad of Billie Sol

Billie Sol was a man from the giant Texas land.
He put the Chamber of Commerce on a limb.
They voted him the best and the government did no less until the I.O.U.s of Texas fell on him.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
I remember when Bill had influential friends.
He celebrated Christmas every day.
He filled Texas banks with his fertilizer tanks.
Influential friends don't die.
they only fade away.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
The democrats deny and Orville Freeman sighs.
He said, "Everyone around was fair and square."
But He was no more convincing than Ezra Taft Benson as resignations cropped up everywhere.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
And now I'd like to say that crime sure doesn't pay, but, if you want to make some money on the sly, well, you can always rent the U.S. Government.
It's the best one that money can buy.
Stand tall, Billie Sol.
we don't know you at all.
We've taken down your pictures from the wall.
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal.
We have got to face elections in the fall.
