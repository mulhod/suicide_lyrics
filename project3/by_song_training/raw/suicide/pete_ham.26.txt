#I'll Be the One

Where did you go when you were needed?
Was it some place I know, where they care?
Cries in the rain.
I'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart.
I'll be the one.
we'll be together.
I'll be the one forever and ever.
Look at me now.
am I the loser?
If you can't tell me how, tell me why.
But just the same, I'll learn to get by without you for the pain in my heart.
I'll be the one.
we'll be together.
I'll be the one forever and ever and ever.
I'll be the one.
we'll be together.
I'll be the one forever and ever and ever.
