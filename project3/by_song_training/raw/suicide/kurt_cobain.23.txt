#Radio Friendly Unit Shifter

I just want to know, do you like me?
Use just once and destroy.
Invasion of our piracy.
Afterbirth of a nation.
Starve without your skeleton key.
I love you for what I am not.
I do not want what I have got.
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns.
Speak at once while taking turns.
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
I'm going to do with what you think, if you ever think at all.
Bi-polar opposites attract.
All of a sudden my water broke.
I love you for what I am not.
I do not want what I have got.
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns.
Second-rate third-degree burns.
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think of me?
Hate, hate your enemies.
Save, save your friends.
Find, find your place.
Speak, speak the truth.
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think of me?
Use just once and destroy.
Invasion of our piracy.
Afterbirth of a nation.
Starve without your skeleton key.
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think of me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think of me?
