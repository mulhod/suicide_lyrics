#Tourette's

Mayday every day in my heart.
Could've had a heart attack in my heart.
We don't know anything in my heart.
We all want something fair in my heart.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Out of town, out of sight is my heart.
Queen of lies every day in my heart.
My heart, one more on the phone, my heart.
One more at the phone, at my heart.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Mean heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart, vold heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart!
Ugh!
