#Miss Misery

i'll fake it through the day with some help from johnny walker red and the cold pain behind my eyes that shoots back through my head, with two tickets torn in half and a lot of nothing to do, but it's alright because some enchanted night i'll be with you.
tarot cards and the lines in my hand tell me i'm wrong, but then untrue.
got plans for both of us that involved a trip out of town to a place i've seen in a magazine that you left lying around.
i can't hold my liquor, but i keep a good attitude because it's alright.
some enchanted night i'll be with you and,
 though you'd rather see me gone than to see this, come the day i'll be waiting for you, anyway.
next door the tv's flashing blue frames on the wall.
it's a comedy from the 70's with a lead no one recalls, vanished into oblivion.
it's easy to do.
and i cried to sleep when you talked to me the day you said we were through, but it's alright.
some enchanted night i'll be with you.
