#Gas Station Women

Everything is going wrong.
everything is bad.
There's no one I can talk to when I am feeling sad.
She broke my heart a million ways.
I'm losing all my friends.
The boys down at the factory ask me where I've been.
Fill her up with love, please, won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say, but that was before I lost my baby.
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today.
I never should have left my home, never left the farm, but the city was excitin.
it couldn't do me any harm.
The more folks I run across, the less I seem to know.
The days go by too quickly.
the nights go by too slow.
Fill her up with love, please, won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say, but that was before I lost my baby.
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today.
I cannot face another girl.
I believe I'll turn to drink, so I won't remember, so I won't have to think.
Tomorrow will bring happiness or at least another day, so I will bid farewell and I'll be on my way.
Fill her up with love, please, won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say, but that was before I lost my baby.
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today.
