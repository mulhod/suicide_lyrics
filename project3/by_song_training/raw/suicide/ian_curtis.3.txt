#Passover

This is a crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept, doubting, unsettling, and turning around, wondering what will come next. 
Is this the role that you wanted to live? 
I was foolish to ask for so much. 
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch. 
Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time.
people who change for no reason at all.
It's happening all of the time. 
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties when all's said and done.
I know that I'll lose every time.
Moving along in our God-given ways.
safety is sat by the fire, sanctuary from these feverish smiles.
Left with a mark on the door.
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
"Forgive and forget"'s what they teach.
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach.
This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept, turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next.
