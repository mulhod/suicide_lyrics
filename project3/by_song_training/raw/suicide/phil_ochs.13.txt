#City Boy

I'm just a city boy, born and bred.
It's a city life I've led.
My pasture was a street.
I've never climbed a tree, but that's alright with me because I'm a city boy.
I'm just a city boy, born and raised.
From these rooftops I have gazed, where the grass was made of steel.
I've never plowed a field.
until the pavement starts to peel, I'll be a city boy.
I'm just a city boy, born and grown.
That's all I've ever known.
Where the lights would greet the dawn, there's a factory for a farm.
Sure, the city has its charm when you're a city boy.
