#See-Saw Granpa

You want to have fun.
you want to just run.
You want to do a lot of things that older people never do.
Gotta give up.
is that what they say?
Well, don't believe a word and then do it my way.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa, and watch them grow older when you were still young.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa.
You gotta be bolder.
let's always be sound.
You want to just move.
you want to just groove.
You want to do a lot of things that older people never do.
You gotta give up.
is that what they say?
Well, don't believe a word of it and do it my way.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa, and watch them grow older when you were still young.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa.
I said you gotta be bolder.
let's always be sound.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa, and watch them grow older when you were still young.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa.
I said you gotta be bolder.
let's always be sound.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on my see-saw, Grandpa, and watch them grow older when you were still young.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on my see-saw, Grandpa, and watch them grow older when you were still young.
Aw, come on!
Aw, come on!
Aw, come on!
Aw, come on!
