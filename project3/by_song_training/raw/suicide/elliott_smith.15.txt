#Clementine

they're waking you up to close the bar.
the street's wet.
you can tell by the sound of the cars.
the bartender's singing clementine while he's turning around the open sign.
dreadful sorry, clementine.
though you're still her man, it seems a long time gone.
maybe the whole thing's wrong.
what if she thinks so, but just didn't say so?
you drank yourself into slow-mo, made an angel in the snow.
anything to pass the time and keep that song out of your mind.
oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh, my darling clementine.
dreadful sorry, clementine.
