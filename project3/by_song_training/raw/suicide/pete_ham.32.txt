#Know One Knows

No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when I see you glow.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it show.
Keep it coming.
keep it long.
Caress me with your body song.
Reach it higher with each sigh, knowing soon that we will fly.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when I see you glow.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it flow.
Keep it moving.
keep it bright and guide me with your body light.
Come in closer with each sigh, knowing soon that we will fly.
No one knows.
No one knows.
No one knows.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it show.
No one knows.
No one knows how good I feel when you let it flow.
Keep on feeling.
keep it whole and lead me with your body soul.
Take me higher with each sigh, knowing you can make me fly.
No one knows it.
No one knows it.
No one knows it, no.
No one knows how good I feel when I see you glow.
