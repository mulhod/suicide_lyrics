Guess your dreams always end.
They don't rise up, just descend.
But I don't care anymore.
I've lost the will to want more.
I'm not afraid, not at all.
I watch them all as they fall, but I remember when we were young.
Those with habits of waste, their sense of style and good taste, of making sure you were right.
Hey, don't you know you were right?
I'm not afraid anymore.
I keep my eyes on the door, but I remember.
Tears of sadness for you, more upheaval for you reflects a moment in time, a special moment in time.
Yeah, we wasted our time,
We didn't really have time, but we remember when we were young.
And all God's angels beware and all you judges beware.
Sons of chance, take good care for all the people not there.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Oh, I'm not afraid anymore.
