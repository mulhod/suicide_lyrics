#Son of a Gun

Up, up, up and down.
turn, turn, turn around.
Round, round, roundabout.
And over again.
Gun, gun, son of a gun.
You are the only one makes any difference what I say.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
Up, up, up and down.
turn, turn, turn around.
Round, round, roundabout.
And over again.
Gun, gun, son of a gun.
You are the only one makes any difference what I say.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
Up, up, up and down.
turn, turn, turn around.
Round, round, roundabout.
And over again.
Gun, gun, son of a gun.
You are the only one makes any difference what I say.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
The sun shines in the bedroom when we play.
The raining always starts when you go away.
