#Jim Dean of Indiana

It was on an Indiana farm in the middle of the country, growing in the fields of grain, Jim Dean of Indiana.
His mother died when he was a boy.
his father was a stranger.
Marcus Winslow took him in.
nobody seemed to want him.
The hired man sang like a storm.
sometimes he'd beat him because he would never do the chores.
he was lost in dreaming.
He never seemed to find a play with the flatlands and the farmers, so he had to leave one day, he said to be an actor.
Once he'd come back to the farm with starlets from the stages.
They locked themselves inside his room.
the people turned their faces.
A neighbor ran from the movie-house.
chickens they were scattered.
He swore he saw upon the screen, Jim Dean of Indiana.
He played a boy without a home, torn with no tomorrow, reaching out to touch someone, a stranger in the shadow.
The Winslows left for the movie town.
they drove across the country.
They hoped that he would stay around and they hoped he would be friendly.
He talked to them for half an hour, but he was busy racing.
He left for the Grapevine Road 1.
they left for Indiana.
Then Marcus heard on the radio that a movie-star was dying.
He turned the tuner way down low, so Ortense could go on sleeping.
It was not until they reached the farm where the hired man was waiting.
The wind rushed silent through the grain.
it was just as they had told him.
They buried him just down the road, a mile from the farmhouse.
That is where I placed a flower for Jim Dean of Indiana.
