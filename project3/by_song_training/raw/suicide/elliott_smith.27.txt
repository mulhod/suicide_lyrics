#Junk Bond Trader

the imitation picks you up like a habit, writing in the glow of the tv's static, taking out the trash to the man.
give the people something they understand.
a stickman flashing a fine-line smile.
junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a style.
rich man in a poor man's clothes.
the permanent installment of the daily dose.
and you tell off when you tell it like it is.
your world's no wider than your hatred of his.
checking into a small reality, boring as a drug you take too regularly.
the athlete's laugh.
the broken crutch.
the first true love that folded at the slightest touch, brought down like an old hotel.
people digging through rubble for things they can resell.
happy holidays, said sick savior, the leaving lover that i still favor.
i won't take your medicine.
i don't need a remedy to be everything i'm supposed to be.
i don't want nobody else.
i can do it by myself.
we're meant to be together.
now i'm a policeman directing traffic, keeping everything moving, everything static.
i'm the hitchhiker you'll recognize passing on your way to some everlasting.
better sell it while you can.
better sell it while you can.
better sell it while you can.
better sell it while you can.
