#girl from the north country if you 're travel in the north country fair , where the wind hit heavy on the borderline , remember me to the one who live there for he once be a true love of me . 
if you go when the snowflake storm , when the river freeze and summer end , please see he have a coat so warm to keep he from the howl wind . 
please see if he hair hang long , if it roll and flow all down he breast . 
please see for me if he hair 's hang long for this 's the way i remember he well . 
i 'm wonder if he remember me at all . 
many time i 've often pray in the darkness of me night , in the brightness of me day . 
so , if you 're travel in the north country fair , where the wind hit heavy on the borderline , remember me to the one who live there for he once be a true love of me .
