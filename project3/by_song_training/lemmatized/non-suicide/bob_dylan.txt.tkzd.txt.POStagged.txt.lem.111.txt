"well , i get up and i walk around , up and down the lonesome town .

i do n't see you around . 
" well , now , time pass and now it seem everybody 's have they dream . 
everybody see hisself walk around with no one else . 
"half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time , but all the people ca n't be all right all of the time " . 
i think abraham lincoln say this . 
"i'll let you be in me dream if i can be in you " .
