#i do not want this i 'm lose grind . 
you know how this world can beat you down . 
i 'm make of clay . 
i fear i 'm the only one who think this way . 
i 'm always fall down the same hill . 
bamboo puncture this skin and nothing come bleed out of me just like a waterfall i 'm drown in . 
two foot below the surface i can still make out you wavy face . 
if i can just reach you maybe i can leave this place . 
i do not want this . 
i do not want this . 
i do not want this . 
i do not want this . 
do n't you tell me how i feel . 
do n't you tell me how i feel . 
do n't you tell me how i feel . 
you do n't know just how i feel . 
i stay inside me be . 
i have live so many life all in me head . 
do n't tell me this you care . 
there really be n't anything now , be there ? 
you will know , will n't you ? 
you extend you hand to this who suffer , to this who know what it really feel like , to this who 've have a taste like this mean something . 
and oh so sick i be . 
and maybe i do n't have a choice . 
and maybe this be all i have . 
and maybe this be a cry for help . 
i do not want this . 
i do not want this . 
i do not want this . 
i do not want this . 
do n't you tell me how i feel . 
do n't you tell me how i feel . 
do n't you tell me how i feel . 
you do n't know just how i feel . 
i want to know everything . 
i want to be everywhere . 
i want to fuck everyone in the world . 
i want to do something this matter . 
i want to know everything . 
i want to be everywhere . 
i want to fuck everyone in the world . 
i want to do something this matter . 
i want to know everything . 
i want to be everywhere . 
i want to fuck everyone in the world . 
i want to do something this matter . 
i want to know everything . 
i want to be everywhere . 
i want to fuck everyone in the world . 
i want to do something this matter .
