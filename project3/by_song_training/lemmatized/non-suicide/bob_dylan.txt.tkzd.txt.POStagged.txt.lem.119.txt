#only a pawn in they game a bullet from the back of a bush take medgar evers 's blood . 
a finger fire the trigger to he name . 
a handle hide out in the dark . 
a hand set the spark . 
two eye take the aim behind a man 's brain , but he ca n't be blame . 
he 's only a pawn in they game . 
a south politician preach to the poor white man , "you get more than the black . 
do n't complain ! 
" you 're well than they . 
you be bear with white skin , they explain . 
and the negro 's name be use , it be plain , for the politician 's gain as he rise to fame and the poor white remain on the caboose of the train , but it be not he to blame . 
he 's only a pawn in they game . 
the deputy sheriff , the soldier , the governor get pay and the marshal and cop get the same , but the poor white man 's use in the hand of they all like a tool . 
he 's teach in he school from the start by the rule this the law be with he , to protect he white skin , to keep up he hate , so he never think straight about the shape this he 's in , but it be not he to blame . 
he 's only a pawn in they game . 
from the poverty shack he look from the crack to the track and the hoof-beats pound in he brain and he 's teach how to walk in a pack , shoot in the back with he fist in a clinch , to hang and to lynch , to hide beneath a hood , to kill with no pain like a dog on a chain . 
he be not get no name , but it be not he to blame . 
he 's only a pawn in they game . 
today medgar evers be bury from the bullet he catch . 
they lower he down as a king . 
but , when the shadowy sun set on the one this fire the gun , he 'll see by he grave on the stone this remain , carve next to he name he epitaph plain , "only a pawn in they game .
