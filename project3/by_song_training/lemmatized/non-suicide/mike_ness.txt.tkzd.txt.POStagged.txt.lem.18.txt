#so far away i 've sing the blue , for every break hearted lovesick dream for you . 
i 've pay me due , work hard-sweat , blood , and tear for you . 
so far away , so far away , so far away ! 
so far away , so far away , so far away ! 
i 've have it all , and lose it all in one blackout summer night . 
i want it back , but i just ca n't seem to get it right . 
so far away , so far away , so far away ! 
so far away , so far away , so far away ! 
i 've sing the blue , for every break hearted lovesick dream for you . 
i 've pay me due , work hard-sweat , blood and tear for you . 
so far away , so far away , so far away ! 
so far away , so far away , so far away !
