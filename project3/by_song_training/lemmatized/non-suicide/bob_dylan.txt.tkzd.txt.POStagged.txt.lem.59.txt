#all along the watchtower " there must be some way out of here , " say the joker to the thief . 
" there 's too much confusion . 
i ca n't get no relief . 
businessman , they drink me wine . 
plowman dig me earth . 
none of they along the line know what any of it be worth . 
" " no reason to get excite , " the thief , he kindly speak . 
" there be many here among we who feel this life be but a joke , but you and i , we 've be through this and this be not we fate , so let we not talk falsely now . 
the hour be get late . 
" all along the watchtower prince keep the view while all the woman come and wend , barefoot servant , too . 
outside in the distance a wildcat do growl . 
two rider be approach . 
the wind begin to howl .
