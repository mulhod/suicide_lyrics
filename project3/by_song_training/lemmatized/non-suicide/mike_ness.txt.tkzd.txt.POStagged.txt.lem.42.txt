#down here ( with the rest of we ) you work hard now , to put the food on the table . 
you 're work for the man who do n't even know you name . 
this 's the way this it go when you 're down here with the rest of we . 
you may lose now , you beautiful child , you happy home , yeah , and you beautiful wife . 
this 's the way this it go when you 're down here with the rest of we . 
you 'll suffer hard now as you bury you love one . 
you 'll suffer hard now when you lose you well friend . 
this 's the way this it go when you 're down here with the rest of we . 
this 's the way this it go and i know how you feel . 
no one 's immune now , to a world of problem . 
no one exempt now from a world of pain . 
this 's the way this it go when you 're down here with the rest of we . 
i try hard now to do the right thing , yet i wonder why i still do what 's wrong . 
this 's the way this it go when you 're down here with the rest of we . 
this 's the way this it go and i know how you feel .
