#last give up try to figure out when me head get lose along the way . 
wear out from give it up , and me soul i piss it all away . 
still sting this shatter nerve , pig we get what pig deserve . 
i 'm go all the way down i 'm leave today . 
come , come , come on you 've get to fill me up . 
come , come , get to let me inside of you . 
come , come , come on , you 're get to fix me up . 
come , come , get to let me inside of you . 
still feel it all slip away , but it do n't matter anymore . 
everybody 's still chip away , but it do n't matter anymore . 
look through this blacken eye ; you 'll see ten thousand lie . 
come , come , come on you 've get to fill me up . 
come , come , get to let me inside of you . 
come , come , come on , you 're get to fix me up . 
come , come , get to let me get through to you .

this be n't mean to last .

i know it 's all get away , and it come to me as no surprise . 
i know what 's come to me , and be never go to arrive . 
fresh blood through tire skin , new sweat to drown me in . 
dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive . 
come , come , come on you 've get to fill me up . 
come , come , get to let me inside of you . 
come , come , come on , you 're get to fix me up . 
come , come , get to let me get through to you .

i want you to make me , i want you to take me , i want you to break me , then i want you to throw me away . 
i want you to make me , i want you to take me , i want you to break me , then i want you to throw me away .
