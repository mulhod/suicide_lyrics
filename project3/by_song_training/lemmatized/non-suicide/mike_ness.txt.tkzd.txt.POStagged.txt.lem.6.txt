#ca n't take it with you i 'll tell you something , baby this 's a fact : never see a hearse , with a luggage rack . 
all you money , you hard earn pay , it do n't mean shit , baby , at the end of the end of the day . 
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go . 
as sure as life , and the light of day , i 'll tell you something , i 've hear they they say : it do n't matter , baby , what you worth , since we all , we all go back to mother earth . 
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go . 
work all you life , you become a slave . 
there be not no spend when you 're in the grave . 
even if it 's rain , thousand dollar bill , think of me baby , in you mansion on the hill . 
ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you ( oh yeah ) , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , oh no you ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you , ca n't take it with you when you go .
