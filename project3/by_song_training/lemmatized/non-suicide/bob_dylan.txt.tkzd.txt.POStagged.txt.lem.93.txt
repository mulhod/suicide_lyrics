#tough mama tough mama , meat shake on you bone . 
i 'm go to go down to the river and get some stone . 
sister 's on the highway with this steel-driving crow . 
papa 's in the big house . 
he work day be through , tough mama , can i blow a little smoke on you ? 
dark beauty , wo n't you move over and give me some room ? 
it 's me duty to bring you down to the field where the flower bloom . 
ash in the furnace . 
dust on the rise . 
you come through it all the way , fly through the sky , dark beauty , with this long night 's journey in you eye . 
sweet goddess , bear of a blind light and a change wind . 
now , do n't be modest . 
you know who you be and where you be . 
jack the cowboy wend up north . 
he 's bury in the past . 
lone wolf wend out drink . 
this be over pretty fast . 
sweet goddess , you perfect stranger 's come on in at last . 
silver angel , with the badge of the lonesome road write in you sleeve , i 'd be grateful if this golden ring you 'd receive . 
today on the countryside it be hot than a crotch . 
i stand alone upon the ridge and all i do be watch . 
sweet goddess , must be time to carve another notch . 
i 'm crestfallen , a world of illusion at me door . 
i be not haul any of me lamb to the marketplace anymore . 
prison wall be crumble down . 
there be no end in sight . 
i 've gain some recognition , but i lose me appetite . 
sweet beauty , meet me at the border late tonight .
