#do n't drag me down child be teach to hate . 
parent just can n't wait . 
some be rich and some be poor . 
others will just suffer more . 
have you ever be ashamed and feel society try to keep you down ? 
i begin to watch thing change and see they turn around . 
turn around , they 'll try to keep you down . 
turn around , turn around , do n't drag me down . 
ignorance like a gun in hand . 
reach out to the promise land . 
you history book be full of lie . 
media-blitz go to dry you eye .
