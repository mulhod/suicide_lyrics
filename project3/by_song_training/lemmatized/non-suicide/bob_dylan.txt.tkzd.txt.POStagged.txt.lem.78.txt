#went to see the gypsy i wend to see the gypsy stay in a big hotel . 
he smile when he see me come and he say , "well , well , well . 
" he room be dark and crowd . 
light be low and dim . 
"how be you ? 
" he say to me . 
i say it back to he . 
i wend down to the lobby to make a small call out . 
a pretty , dance girl be there and he begin to shout , "go on back to see the gypsy ! 
he can move you from the rear , drive you from you fear , bring you through the mirror . 
he do it in las vegas and he can do it here ! 
" outside the light be shine on the river of tear . 
i watch they from the distance with the music in me ear . 
i wend back to see the gypsy . 
it be nearly early dawn . 
the gypsy 's door be open wide , but the gypsy be go . 
and this pretty , dance girl , he can not be find , so i watch this sun come rise from the little minnesota town , from the little minnesota town .
