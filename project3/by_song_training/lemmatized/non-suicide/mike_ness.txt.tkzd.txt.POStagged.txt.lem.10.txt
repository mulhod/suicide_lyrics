#do n't take me for grant i 'm you wear in leather jacket . 
i 'm the volume in you fuck up teenage band . 
a bag of smoke and a six pack , i 'm the dream you have walkin down the railroad track , you and me . 
i 'm you first taste of romance . 
i 'm you first break heart on a saturday night . 
guy like we be not get no chance , but i 'm the thing this keep you and me alive , but not forever . 
so take me down the road . 
take me to the show . 
it 's something to believe in this no one else know . 
but do n't take me for grant . 
i 'm the blood on you guitar . 
i 'm this wave you catch back in 1975 . 
i 'm as strong as a thousand army . 
i 'm as soft as a pedal on a long stem rise . 
i be love . 
so take me down the road . 
take me to the show . 
it 's something to believe in this no one else know . 
but do n't take me for grant . 
i 'm with you when you 're bear . 
you can take me when you die with all the reason why . 
but do n't take me for grant . 
no one know . 
do n't take me for grant .
