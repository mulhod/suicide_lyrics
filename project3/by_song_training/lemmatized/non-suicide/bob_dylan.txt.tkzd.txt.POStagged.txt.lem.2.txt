#black crow blue i wake in the morning wander , weary and wear out . 
i wake in the morning wander , weary and wear out , wish me long-lost lover will walk to me , talk to me , tell me what it 's all about . 
i be stand at the side road , listen to the billboard knock , stand at the side road , listen to the billboard knock . 
well , me wrist be empty , but me nerve be kick , tick like a clock . 
if i get anything you need , babe , let me tell you in front . 
if i get anything you need , babe , let me tell you in front . 
you can come to me sometime , night-time , day-time , any time you want . 
sometime i 'm think i 'm too high to fall . 
sometime i 'm think i 'm much too high to fall . 
other time i 'm think i 'm so low i do n't know if i can come up at all . 
black crow in the meadow , sleep across a broad highway . 
black crow in the meadow , across a broad highway . 
though it 's funny , honey , i 'm out of touch , do n't feel much like a scarecrow today .
