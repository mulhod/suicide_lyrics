#vessel i let you put it in me mouth . 
i let it get under me skin . 
i let you pump it through me vein . 
i let you take me from within . 
they tell you what we can and can do . 
same thing we 've hear a hundred time before . 
when i put you inside of me , none of this matter anymore . 
me god , can i go any fast ? 
oh me god , i do n't think i can last here . 
i be you , and you be me . 
we will never be alone . 
i have finally find me place in everything . 
i have finally find me home . 
i can leave all of this flesh behind . 
i can see right through this whole facade . 
i be become something else . 
i be turn into god . 
me god can i go any fast ? 
oh me god , i do n't think i can last here .
