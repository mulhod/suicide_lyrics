#reach for the sky when i be young i be invincible . 
i find me not think twice . 
i never think about no future , it 's just a roll of the dice . 
but the day may come when you get something to lose , and just when you think you 're do pay due , you say to you : "dear , god what have i do ? 
" and hope it not too late , cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
yesterday be history , and tomorrow be a mystery . 
but baby right now , it 's just about you and me . 
you can run , you can hide , just like bonnie and clyde . 
reach for the sky be not never go to die . 
and i thank the lord for the love this i have find , and hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
so if you please take this moment , try if you can to make it last . 
do n't think about no future , and just forget about the past . 
and make it last . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky i be not never go down . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky i be not never come down . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come . 
reach for the sky i be not never go down . 
reach for the sky cause tomorrow may never come .
