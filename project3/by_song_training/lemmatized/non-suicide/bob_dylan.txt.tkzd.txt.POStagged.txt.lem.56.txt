'twas down in chaynee county a time they talk about , with he lady by he side he take a stand and soon the situation there be all but straighten out for he be always know to lend a help hand . 
all across the telegraph he name , it do resound , but no charge hold against he can they prove and there be no man around who can track or chain he down . 
he be never know to make a foolish move .
