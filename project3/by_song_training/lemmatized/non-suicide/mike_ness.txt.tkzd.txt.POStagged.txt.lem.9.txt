#highway 101st take a drive baby up the coast , yea highway 101st . 
i 'll pass ventura and santa barbara too , just as fast as me motor run . 
gotta pocket full of memory , some happy and some be sad . 
gotta girl stand by me side through the good time and the bad . 
listen to the boulevard , listen to the fall rain . 
i believe in love now , with all of it joy and pain . 
sick boy , sick girl , look nice dress up on a saturday night . 
take a walk downtown for a while and chase the pale moonlight . 
i can still hear the mission bell and the train roll through you town . 
go to leave this world behind , we 're southern california bind . 
listen to the boulevard , listen to the fall rain . 
i believe in love now , with all of it joy and pain . 
listen to the boulevard , listen to the fall rain . 
i believe in love now , with all of it joy and pain . 
follow the palm tree under the california sun . 
i believe in love now , i believe in love again .
