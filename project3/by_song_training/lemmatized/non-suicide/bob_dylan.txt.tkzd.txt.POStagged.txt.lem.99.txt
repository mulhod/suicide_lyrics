#never say goodbye twilight on the freeze lake , a north wind about to break on footprint in the snow and silence down below . 
you 're beautiful beyond word . 
you 're beautiful to me . 
you can make me cry . 
never say goodbye because me dream be make of iron and steel with a big bouquet of the rose hang down from the heaven to the grind . 
the crash wave roll over me as i stand upon the sand and wait for you to come and grab hold of me hand . 
oh , baby , baby , baby blue , you 'll change you last name too . 
you 've turn you hair to brown . 
love to see it hang down .
