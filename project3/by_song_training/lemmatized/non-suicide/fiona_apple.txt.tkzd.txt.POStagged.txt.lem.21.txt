#pale september pale september . 
i wear the time like a dress this year . 
the autumn day swing soft around me like cotton on me skin . 
but as the ember of the summer lose they breath and disappearred , me heart wend cold and only hollow rhythm resound from within . 
but then he rise , brilliant as the moon in full , and sink in the burrow of me keep. and all me armour fall down in a pile at me foot . 
and me winter give way to warm as i 'm sing he to sleep. he go along just as a water lily , gentle on the surface of he thought he body float unweighed down by passion or intensity , yet unaware of the depth upon which he coast . 
and he find a home in me for what misfortune sow he know me touch will reap . 
and all me armour fall down in a pile at me foot . 
and me winter give way to warm as i 'm sing he to sleep. all me armour fall down in a pile at me foot .
