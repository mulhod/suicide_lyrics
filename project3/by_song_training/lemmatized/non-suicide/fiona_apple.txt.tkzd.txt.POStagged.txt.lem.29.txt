#fast as you can i let the beast in too soon . 
i do n't know how to live without me hand on he throat . 
i fight he always , and still , oh darling , it 's so sweet , you think you know how crazy how crazy i be . 
you say you do n't spook easy ; you wo n't go , but i know and i pray this you will . 
fast as you can , baby , run , free you of me , fast as you can . 
i may be soft in you palm , but i 'll soon grow hungry for a fight , and i will not let you win . 
me pretty mouth will frame the phrase this will disprove you faith in man . 
so if you catch me try to find me way into you heart from under you skin , fast as you can , baby , scratch me out , free you , fast as you can . 
fast as you can , baby , scratch me out , free you , fast as you can . 
sometime me mind do n't shake and shift , but more of the time , it do . 
and i get to the place where i 'm beg for a lift , or i 'll drown in the wonder and the be . 
and i 'll be you girl , if you say it 's a gift . 
and you give me some more of you drug . 
yeah , i 'll be you pet , if you just tell me it 's a gift . 
because i 'm tire of whys , choke on whys . 
just need a little because , because ... i let the beast in , and then i even try forgive he , but it 's too soon . 
so i 'll fight again , again , again , again , again . 
and for a little while more , i 'll soar the uneven wind , complain and blame the sterile land . 
but if you 're get any bright idea , quiet dear i 'm bloom within . 
fast as you can , baby , wait , watch me , i 'll be out fast as i can , maybe late but at less about . 
fast as you can leave me , let this thing run it route , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can , fast as you can .
