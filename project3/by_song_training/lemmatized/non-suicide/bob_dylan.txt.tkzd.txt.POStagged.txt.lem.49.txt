#it take a lot to laugh , it take a train to cry well , i ride on a mail-train , baby , ca n't buy a thrill . 
well , i 've be up all night , lean on the windowsill . 
well , if i die on top of the hill and if i do n't make it , you know me baby will . 
do n't the moon look good , mama , shine through the tree ? 
do n't the brakeman look good , mama , flag down the double e ? 
do n't the sun look good go down over the sea ? 
but do n't me gal look fine when he 's come after me ? 
now , the wintertime be come . 
the window be fill with frost . 
i wend to tell everybody , but i can not get across . 
well , i want to be you lover , baby . 
i do n't want to be you boss . 
do n't say i never warn you when you train get lose .
