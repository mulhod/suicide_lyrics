#pleasure seeker well , here i come . 
i 'm on a run . 
who want to fight temptation , this 's no fun . 
c 'mon and play the game . 
do n't you feel no shame . 
this 's what eve say to adam before he come . 
you can smile now , cry late on . 
you know this it may be wrong , but it feel so good , like you know it will . 
there 's damnation and disgrace . 
and guilt rear it ugly face , yet you beg for more , just a little more . 
stand in line . 
do n't you lose you mind . 
try like me to seek you pleasure , three at a time . 
there 's soul for sale . 
you 're go to burn in hell . 
and if tomorrow never come , it 's just as well . 
you can smile now , cry late on . 
you know this it must be wrong , but it feel so good , like you know it will . 
there 's damnation and disgrace . 
and guilt rear it ugly face , yet you beg for more , just a little more . 
uah . 
feel the pain . 
i feel it too .

play the game . 
do n't feel no shame . 
this 's what eve say to adam before he come you can smile now , cry late on . 
you know this it 's definitely wrong , but it feel so good , like you know it will . 
there 's damnation and disgrace . 
and guilt rear it ugly face , yet you beg for more , just a little more . 
come on and beg for more , just a little more .
