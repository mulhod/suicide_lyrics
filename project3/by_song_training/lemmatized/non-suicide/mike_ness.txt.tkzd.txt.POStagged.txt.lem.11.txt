#footprints on me ceiling everybody want a lover , nobody want to uncover what may lie deep beneath a sometime painful past . 
long ago , without a care , pull gardenia from he hair . 
i think of a time we do n't have a care in the world . 
captivate by he beauty , i know it be me life long duty . 
he have all the grace and charm of a radiant queen . 
how do you talk without speak ? 
how do you hear without listen ? 
how do you live without feel ? 
how do you take without give ? 
and keep it all inside ?

i ca n't help this fuck up feel . 
something 's wrong , you be not come round here no more . 
try to get me thought together , i think of a time when thing be well this miscommunication be break me down . 
how do you talk without speak ? 
how do you hear without listen ? 
how do you live without feel ? 
how do you take without give ? 
how you treat you new well friend ? 
everybody want a lover . 
nobody want to uncover what may lie deep beneath a sometime painful past . 
me heart be heavy , slowly sink . 
i redirect me desperate think , and kiss he red full lip like i do the very first time . 
how do you talk without speak ? 
how do you hear without listen ? 
how do you live without feel ?

and i keep it bottle up inside all me life .
