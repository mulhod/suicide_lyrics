#hurt i hurt me today to see if i still feel . 
i focus on the pain , the only thing this 's real . 
the needle tear a hole , the old familiar sting . 
try to kill it all away , but i remember everything . 
what have i become , me sweet friend ? 
everyone i know go away in the end . 
you can have it all , me empire of dirt . 
i will let you down . 
i will make you hurt . 
i wear this crown of shit upon me liar 's chair . 
full of break thought i can repair . 
beneath the stain of time , the feel disappear . 
you be someone else . 
i be still right here . 
what have i become , me sweet friend ? 
everyone i know go away in the end . 
you can have it all me empire of dirt . 
i will let you down . 
i will make you hurt . 
if i can start again a million mile away , i will keep me . 
i will find a way .
