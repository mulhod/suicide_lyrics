well , i walk the long boulevard me head hang down . 
and the word out on the street i be back up on me foot ; i be fight the same old war have to even up the score . 
and i 'm still alive , and i will survive . 
i can take what life 's get to give just need a little time . 
and i 'm still alive , talk this some ol ' jive . 
i can handle what come me way , just gimme another day . 
and the time have change me friend . 
i 'll be here to the bitter end . 
with a guitar in me hand , i stand a little tall . 
and i 've be to hell and back , i be not fall off this track . 
from the back to the front page , from the gutter to the stage . 
and i 'm still alive and i will survive . 
i can take what life 's get to give just need a little time . 
and i 'm still alive , talk this some ol ' jive . 
i can handle what come me way just gimme another day . 
and from town to town i roam , take me so very far from home . 
and i wake up one summer day and i fall in love . 
and the time have change , me friend . 
i 'll be here to the bitter end . 
and i 'm here to make me stand . 
with a guitar in me hand . 
and i 'm still alive and i will survive . 
i can take what life 's get to give just need a little time . 
and i 'm still alive , talk this some ol ' jive . 
i can handle what come me way just gimme another day , another day .
