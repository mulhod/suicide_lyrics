wish this be the first day of me last day . 
i build it up , now i take it apart . 
climb up real high now fall down real far . 
no need for me to stay . 
the last thing leave , i just throw it away . 
i put me faith in god and me trust in you , now there 's nothing more fuck up i can do . 
wish there be something real , wish there be something true . 
wish there be something real in this world full of you . 
i 'm the one without a soul . 
i 'm the one with this big fuck hole . 
no new tale to tell . 
twenty-six year on me way to hell . 
gotta listen to you big time , hard line , bad luck , fist fuck . 
do n't think you 're have all the fun , you know me i hate everyone . 
wish there be something real , wish there be something true . 
wish there be something real in this world full of you . 
i want to but i ca n't turn back , but i want to .
