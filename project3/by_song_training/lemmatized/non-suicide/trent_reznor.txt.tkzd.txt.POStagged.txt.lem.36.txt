#me , i 'm not well it 's happen . 
never plan on this . 
you 've get something i need , kind of dangerous . 
and i 'm lose control . 
i 'm not use to this . 
what you want from me . 
i 'm not use to this . 
i ca n't shut it off this thing i 've begin . 
and it 's hard to tell just where it 's come from . 
and it 's hard to see what i 'm capable of . 
and it 's hard to believe just what i 've become . 
hey , can we stop... 
me , i 'm not . 
hey , can we stop... 
me , i 'm not hey , can we stop... 
me , i 'm not hey , can we stop... 
me , i 'm not i can swallow it down , keep it all inside . 
i define me by how well i hide . 
i feel it come apart . 
well , at less i try . 
i can win this war by know not to fight . 
if i take it all back , someway , somehow . 
if i know back then what i know right now . 
hey can we stop... 
me , i 'm not . 
hey can we stop... 
me , i 'm not . 
hey , can we stop... 
me , i 'm not . 
hey , can we stop... 
me , i 'm not .
