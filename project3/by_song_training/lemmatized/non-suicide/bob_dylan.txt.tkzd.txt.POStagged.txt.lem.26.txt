#tangled up in blue early one morning the sun be shine . 
i be lay in be , wonder if he 'd change at all , if he hair be still red . 
he folk , they say we life together sure be go to be rough . 
they never do like mama 's homemade dress . 
papa 's bankbook be n't big enough . 
and i be stand on the side of the road , rain fall on me shoe , head out for the east coast . 
lord know , i 've pay some due get through , tangle up in blue . 
he be marry when we first meet , soon to be divorce . 
i help he out of a jam , i guess , but i use a little too much force . 
we drive this car as far as we can , abandon it out west , split up on a dark , sad night , both agree it be well . 
he turn around to look at me as i be walk away . 
i hear he say over me shoulder , "we 'll meet again someday on the avenue , tangle up in blue . 
" i have a job in the great north wood , work as a cook for a spell , but i never do like it all this much and one day the ax just fall , so i drift down to new orleans , where i lucky be to be employ , work for a while on a fish boat right outside of delacroix . 
but , all the while i be alone , the past be close behind . 
i see a lot of woman , but he never escape me mind and i just grow tangle up in blue . 
he be work in a topless place and i stop in for a beer . 
i just keep look at the side of he face in the spotlight so clearly and late on , when the crowd thin out , i be just about to do the same , he be stand there in back of me chair , say to me , "do n't i know you name ? 
" i mutter something underneath me breath . 
he study the line of me face . 
i must admit , feel a little uneasy when he bend down to tie the lace of me shoe , tangle up in blue . 
he light a burner on the stave and offer me a pipe . 
"i think you 'd never say hello , " he say . 
"you look like the silent type . 
" then he open up a book of poem and hand it to me , write by an italian poet from the fifteenth century , and every one of they word ring true and glow like burn coal , pour off of every page like it be write in me soul , from me to you , tangle up in blue . 
i live with they on montague street in a basement down the stair . 
there be music in the cafe at night and revolution in the air . 
then he start into deal with slave and something inside of he die . 
he have to sell everything he own and freeze up inside . 
and , when it finally the bottom fall out , i become withdraw . 
the only thing i know how to do be to keep on keep on like a bird this fly , tangle up in blue . 
so , now i 'm go back again . 
i get to get to he somehow . 
all the people we use to know , they 're an illusion to me now . 
some be mathematician . 
some be carpenter ' wive . 
do n't know how it all get start . 
i do n't know what they 're do with they life , but me , i 'm still on the road , head for another joint . 
we always do feel the same . 
we just see it from a different point of view , tangle up in blue .
