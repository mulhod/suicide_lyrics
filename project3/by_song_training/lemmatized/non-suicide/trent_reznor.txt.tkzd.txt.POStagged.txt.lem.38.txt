#my violent heart you and i , we may look the same , but we be very far apart .' 
there 's bullet hole where me compassion use to be , and there be violence in me heart . 
into fire you can send we . 
from the fire we return . 
you can label we a consequence of how much you have to learn . 
you can try but , you 'll never understand . 
this be something you will never understand . 
can you hear it now ? 
hear it come now . 
can you hear it now ? 
on hand and knee , we crawl . 
you can not stop we all . 
we bone , we skin . 
we will not let you in . 
you have set something in motion , now . 
much great than you 've ever know . 
stand there in all you grand naivety , about to reap what you have sow . 
time will fee upon you weaknesses , and soon you 'll lose the will to care . 
when you return to the place this you call home , we will be there . 
we will be there . 
on hand and knee , we crawl . 
you can not stop we all . 
we blood will stain . 
we will not go away . 
on hand and knee , we crawl . 
you can not stop we all . 
we blood , we way will never leave this place .
