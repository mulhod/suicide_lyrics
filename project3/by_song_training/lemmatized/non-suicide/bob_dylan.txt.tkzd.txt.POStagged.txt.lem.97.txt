#dirge i hate me for love you and the weakness this it show . 
you be just a paint face on a trip down suicide road . 
the stage be set . 
the light wend out all around the old hotel . 
i hate me for love you and i 'm glad the curtain fall . 
i hate this foolish game we play and the need this be express and the mercy this you show to me . 
who ever will have guess ? 
i wend out on low broadway and i feel this place within , this hollow place where martyr weep and angel play with sin . 
hear you song of freedom and man , forever strip , act out he folly while he back be be whip . 
like a slave in orbit , he 's beat till he 's tame . 
all for a moment 's glory and it 's a dirty , rotten shame . 
there be this who worship loneliness . 
i 'm not one of they . 
in this age of fiberglass i 'm search for a gem . 
the crystal ball upon the wall have n't show me nothing yet . 
i 've pay the price of solitude , but at less i 'm out of debt . 
i ca n't recall a useful thing you ever do for me , except pat me on the back one time when i be on me knee . 
we stare into each other 's eye till one of we will break . 
no use to apologize . 
what difference will it make ? 
so , sing you praise of progress and of the doom-machine . 
the naked truth be still taboo whenever it can be see . 
lady luck , who shine on me , will tell you where i 'm at . 
i hate me for love you , but i should get over this .
