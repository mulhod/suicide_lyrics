#restless farewell oh , all the money this in me whole life i do spend , be it me right or wrongfully , i let it slip gladly to me friend to tie up the time more forcefully . 
but the bottle be do , we 've kill each one , and the table 's full and overflow , and the corner sign say it 's close time , so i 'll bid farewell and be down the road . 
oh , every girl this ever i 've touch , i do not do it harmfully and every girl this ever i 've hurt , i do not do it knowingly . 
but to remain as friend you need the time to make amend and stay behind and , since me foot be now fast and point away from the past , i 'll bid farewell and be down the line . 
oh , every foe this ever i face , the cause be there before we come and every cause this ever i fight , i fight it full without regret or shame . 
but the dark do die as the curtain be draw and somebody 's eye must meet the dawn and , if i see the day , i 'd only have to stay , so i 'll bid farewell in the night and be go . 
oh , every think this 's string a knot in me mind , i may go insane if it can n't be spring , but it 's not to stand naked under unknowing eye , it 's for me and me friend me story be sing . 
but the time be not tall , yet on time you depend , and no word be possess by no special friend and , though the line be cut , it be not quite the end . 
i 'll just bid farewell till we meet again . 
oh , a false clock try to tick out me time , to disgrace , distract , and bother me and the dirt of gossip blow into me face and the dust of rumor cover me . 
but , if the arrow be straight and the point be slick , it can pierce through dust no matter how thick , so i 'll make me stand and remain as i be and bid farewell and not give a damn .
