#if dog run free if dog run free , why not we across the swoop plain ? 
me ear hear a symphony of two mule , train , and rain . 
the well be always yet to come . 
this 's what they explain to me . 
just do you thing , you 'll be king if dog run free . 
if dog run free , why not me across the swamp of time ? 
me mind weave a symphony and tapestry of rhyme . 
oh , wind , which rush me tale to you , so it may flow and be , to each he own . 
it 's all unknown if dog run free . 
if dog run free , then what must be must be and this be all . 
true love can make a blade of grass stand up straight and tall . 
in harmony with the cosmic sea , true love need no company . 
it can cure the soul . 
it can make it whole if dog run free .
