#o ' sailor i 'm undecided about you again . 
may n't be right this you 're not here . 
it 's double-sided , cause i ruin it all , but also save me , by never believe you , dear . 
everything good , i deem too good to be true . 
everything else be just a bear . 
everything i have to look forward to have a pretty painful and very impose before . 
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ? 
what 'd you do this for ? 
say there 's nothing to it , and then let it go by the board . 
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ? 
what 'd you do this for ? 
say there 's nothing to it , and then let it go by the board . 
i have too be play with fifty-two card . 
just cause i play so far from me vest . 
whatever i 've get , i 've get no reason to guard . 
what can i do , but spend me well ?

o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ? 
what 'd you do this for ? 
say there 's nothing to it , and then let it go by the board . 
and after wait , fight patiently on me knee . 
all the other stuff tire it out first , not me . 
and in it wake , appear the touch and call of a different breed , one who set to get me wise , and get me there , and then get me . 
and what a thing , to know what can be instead . 
oh , what a bless curse to see . 
it take the agenda from it place in me be , make a merry paramour of me . 
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ? 
what 'd you do this for ? 
say there 's nothing to it , and then let it go by the board . 
o ' sailor , why 'd you do it ? 
what 'd you do this for ? 
give me eye to view it , as it go by the board .
