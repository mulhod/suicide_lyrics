#gave up perfect little dream the kind this hurt the more . 
forget how it feel well almost . 
no one to blame always the same . 
open me eye . 
wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up in flame . 
it take you to make me realize . 
it take you to make me realize . 
it take you to make me realize . 
it take you to make me see the light . 
smash up me sanity . 
smash up me integrity . 
smash up what i believe in . 
smash up what 's leave of me . 
smash up me everything . 
smash up all this be true . 
go to smash me to piece , i do n't know what else to do . 
cover in hope and vaseline , still can fix this break machine . 
watch the hole it use to be me . 
just watch it burn in me steady , systematic decline of the trust i will betray . 
give it to me i throw it away . 
and after everything i 've do i hate me for what i 've become . 
i try , i give up . 
i try , i give up . 
i try , i give up . 
i try , and i give up . 
throw it away .
