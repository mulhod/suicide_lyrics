# the way thing be i will n't know what to do with another chance if you give it to me . 
i can n't take the embrace of a real romance . 
it 'd race right through me . 
i 'm much well off the way thing be . 
much , much well off , well by far , by far . 
i will n't know what to say to a gentle voice . 
it 'd roll right past me . 
and if you chalk it up you 'll see i do n't really have a choice so do n't even ask me . 
i 'm much well off the way thing be . 
much , much well off , well by far . 
so keep on call me name , keep on , keep on , and i 'll keep kick the crap till it 's go . 
if you keep on kill , you can get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on . 
how can i fight , when we 're on the same side ? 
how can i fight beside you ? 
so keep on call me name , keep on , keep on . 
and i 'll keep on kick the crap till it 's go . 
if you keep on kill , you can get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on . 
so keep on callng me name , keep on , keep on . 
and i 'll keep kick the crap till it 's go . 
if you keep on kill , you can get me to settle , and as soon as i settle , i bet i 'll be able to move on .
