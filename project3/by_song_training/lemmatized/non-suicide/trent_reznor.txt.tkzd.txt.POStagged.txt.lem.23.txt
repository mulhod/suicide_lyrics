# the become i beat me machine . 
it 's a part of me . 
it 's inside of me i 'm stick in this dream . 
it 's change me . 
i be become . 
the me this you know have some second thought . 
he 's cover with scab and he be break and sore . 
the me this you know do n't come around much . 
this part of me be n't here anymore . 
all pain disappear . 
it 's the nature of , of me circuitry . 
drown out all i hear . 
there 's no escape from this , me new consciousness . 
the me this you know use to have feeling , but the blood have stop pump , and he be leave to decay . 
the me this you know be now make up of wire . 
and even when i 'm right with you , i 'm so far away . 
i can try to get away , but iï¿½ve strap me in . 
i can try to scratch away the sound in me ear . 
i can see it kill away all me bad part . 
i do n't want to listen but it 's all too clearly . 
hide backward inside of me i feel so unafraid . 
annie , hold a little tight i may just slip away . 
it wo n't give up it want me dead . 
goddam this noise inside me head . 
it wo n't give up it want me dead . 
goddam this noise inside me head . 
it wo n't give up it want me dead . 
goddam this noise inside me head . 
it wo n't give up it want me dead . 
goddam this noise inside me head . 
it wo n't give up it want me dead .
