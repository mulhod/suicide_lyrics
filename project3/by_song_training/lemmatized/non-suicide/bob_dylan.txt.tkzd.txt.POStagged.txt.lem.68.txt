#i throw it all away i once hold he in me arm . 
he say he will always stay . 
but i be cruel . 
i treat he like a fool . 
i throw it all away . 
once i have mountain in the palm of me hand and river this run through every day . 
i must 've be mad . 
i never know what i have until i throw it all away . 
love be all there be . 
it make the world go around , love and only love . 
it ca n't be deny . 
no matter what you think about it , you just wo n't be able to do without it . 
take a tip from one who 's try . 
so , if you find someone who give you all of he love , take it to you heart . 
do n't let it stray for one thing for certain , you will surely be hurt if you throw it all away .
