#burn this world reject me . 
this world throw me away . 
this world never give me a chance . 
this world go to have to pay . 
well i do n't believe in you institution . 
i do what you want me to . 
and like the cancer in you system . 
i 've get a little surprise for you . 
something inside of me have open up it eye . 
why do you put it there ? 
do you not realise ? 
this thing inside of me it scream the loud sound . 
sometime i think i can . 
burn .

i look down there where you 're stand . 
flock of sheep all on display . 
with all you lie pile up around you . 
i can take it all away . 
something inside of me have open up it eye . 
why do you put it there ? 
do you not realise ? 
this thing inside of me it scream the loud sound . 
sometime i think i can . 
i 'm go to burn this whole world down .

i never be a part of you burn . 
i never be a part of you burn . 
i never be a part of you burn . 
i never be a part of you burn . 
i never be a part of you burn . 
i never be a part of you burn . 
i never be a part of you burn . 
i be you savior . 
i be corruption . 
i be the angel of you destruction . 
i be perversion , secret desire . 
i be you future swallow up in fire .
