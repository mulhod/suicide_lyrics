# the good soldier gun fire in the street where we use to meet echo out a beat , and the bass go ... bomb , right over me head , step over the dead . 
remember what you say , you know , the part about life be just a wake dream , well i know what you mean , but this be not how it seem right here right now . 
how can all this be real ? 
i can barely feel anymore . 
i be try to see . 
i be try to believe . 
this be not where i should be . 
i be try to believe . 
blood harden in the sand . 
cold metal in me hand may help you understand the way this thing be go to be . 
there 's nowhere else to hide cause god be on we side , i keep tell me . 
i be try to see . 
i be try to believe . 
this be not where i should be . 
i be try to believe .
