# to you love here 's another speech you wish i 'd swallow . 
another cue for you to fold you ear . 
another train of think too hard to follow , chug along to the song this belong to the shift of gear . 
please forgive me for me distance . 
the pain be the evident in me existence . 
please forgive me for me distance . 
the shame be manifest in me resistance to you love , to you love , to you love . 
i will 've warn you , but really , what 's the point ? 
caution can , but rarely ever help . 
do n't be down when me demeanor tend to disappoint . 
it 's hard enough even try to be civil to me . 
please forgive me for me distance . 
the pain be evident in me existence . 
please forgive me for me distance . 
the shame be manifest in me resistance to you love , to you love , to you love . 
me derring-do allow me to dance the rigadoon around you , but by the time i 'm close to you , i lose me desideratum and now you , so now you have it . 
so baby tell me what 's the word ? 
be i you gal , or should i get out of town ? 
i just need to be reassure . 
do you just deal it out , or can you deal with what i lie down ? 
please forgive me , for me distance . 
the pain be evident in me existence . 
please forgive me for me distance . 
the shame be manifest in me resistance to you love , to you love , to you love , to you love , to you love , to you love , to you love , to you love .
