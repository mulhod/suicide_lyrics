#sleep to dream i tell you how i feel , but you do n't care . 
i say tell me the truth , but you do n't dare . 
you say love be a hell you can bear , and i say gimme me back and then go there for all i care . 
i get me foot on the grind , and i do n't go to sleep to dream . 
you get you head in the cloud , and you 're not at all what you seem . 
this mind , this body , and this voice can be stifle by you deviant way , so do n't forget what i tell you : do n't come around i get me own hell to raise . 
i have never be so insult in all me life . 
i can swallow the sea to wash down all this pride . 
first you run like a fool just to be at me side , and now you run like a fool , but you just run to hide , and i ca n't abide . 
i get me foot on the grind , and i do n't go to sleep to dream . 
you get you head in the cloud , and you 're not at all what you seem . 
this mind , this body , and this voice can be stifle by you deviant way , so do n't forget what i tell you : do n't come around i get me own hell to raise . 
do n't make it a big deal . 
do n't be so sensitive . 
we 're not play a game anymore . 
you do n't have to be so defensive . 
do n't you plead me you case . 
do n't bother to explain . 
do n't even show me you face because it 's a cry shame . 
just go back to the rock from under which you come . 
take the sorrow you give and all the stake you claim , and do n't forget the blame . 
i get me foot on the grind , and i do n't go to sleep to dream . 
you get you head in the cloud , and you 're not at all what you seem . 
this mind , this body and this voice can be stifle by you deviant way , so do n't forget what i tell you : do n't come around i get me own hell to raise .
