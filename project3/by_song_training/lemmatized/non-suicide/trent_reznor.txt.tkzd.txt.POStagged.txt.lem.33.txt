#survivalism i should have listen to he . 
so hard to keep control . 
we keep on eat but we bloat belly 's still not full . 
he give we all he have , but we wend and take some more . 
ca n't seem to shut he leg . 
we mother nature be a whore . 
i get me propaganda . 
i get revisionism . 
i get me violence in hi-def ultra-realism . 
all a part of this great nation . 
i get me fist . 
i get me plan . 
i get survivalism . 
hypnotic sound of siren echo through the street . 
the cock of the rifle , the march of the foot . 
you see you world on fire . 
do n't try to act surprise . 
we do just what you tell we . 
lose we faith along the way and find we believe you lie . 
i get me propaganda . 
i get revisionism . 
i get me violence in hi-def ultra-realism . 
all a part of this great nation . 
i get me fist . 
i get me plan . 
i get survivalism . 
all bruise and break , bleed , he ask to take me hand . 
i turn , just keep on walk , but you 'd do the same thing in the circumstance . 
i 'm sure you 'll understand . 
i get me propaganda . 
i get revisionism . 
i get me violence in hi-def ultra-realism . 
all a part of this great nation . 
i get me fist . 
i get me plan . 
i get survivalism .
