" #it be not me , babe go away from me window . 
leave at you own choose speed . 
i 'm not the one you want , babe . 
i 'm not the one you need . 
you say you 're look for someone who 's never weak , but always strong to protect you and defend you whether you be right or wrong , someone to open each and every door , but it be not me , babe . 
no , no , no , it be not me , babe . 
it be not me you 're look for , babe . 
go lightly from the ledge , babe . 
go lightly on the grind . 
i 'm not the one you want , babe . 
i will only let you down . 
you say you 're look for someone who will promise never to part , someone to close he eye for you , someone to close he heart , someone who will die for you and more , but it be not me , babe . 
no , no , no , it be not me , babe . 
it be not me you 're look for , babe . 
go melt back in the night . 
everything inside be make of stone . 
there 's nothing in here move and , anyway , i 'm not alone . 
you say you 're look for someone who 'll pick you up each time you fall , to gather flower constantly , and to come each time you call , a lover for you life and nothing more , but it be not me , babe . 
no , no , no , it be not me , babe . 
it be not me you 're look for , babe .
