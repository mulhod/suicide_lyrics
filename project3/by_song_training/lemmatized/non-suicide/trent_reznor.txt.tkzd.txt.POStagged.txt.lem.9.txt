#down in it kinda like a cloud , i be up , way up in the sky , and i be feel some feeling you will n't believe . 
sometime i do n't believe they me , and i decide i be never come down . 
just then a tiny little dot catch me eye . 
it be just about too small to see , but i watch it way too long . 
it be pull me down . 
i be up about it . 
i be up above it . 
now i 'm down in it i be up above it . 
i be up above it . 
now i 'm down in it . 
well shut up . 
so what , what do it matter now ? 
i be swim in the haze now i crawl on the grind . 
and everything i never like about you be kind of seep into me . 
try to laugh about it now , but be n't it funny how everything work out . 
"i guess the joke 's on me , " he say . 
i be up about it . 
i be up above it . 
now i 'm down in it i be up above it . 
i be up above it . 
now i 'm down in it . 
i use to be so big and strong . 
i use to know me right from wrong . 
i use to never be afraid . 
i use to be somebody i use to have something inside . 
now just this hole this 's open wide . 
i use to want it all . 
i use to be somebody . 
i 'll cross me heart and hope to die , but the needle 's already in me eye . 
and all the world 's weight be on me back , and i do n't even know why . 
and what i use to think be me be just a fade memory . 
i look he right in the eye and say goodbye . 
be up about it . 
i be up above it . 
now i 'm down in it i be up above it . 
i be up above it . 
now i 'm down in it .
