#that 's what i get just when everything be make sense , you take away all me self-confidence . 
now all this i 've be hear must be true . 
i guess i 'm not the only boy for you . 
but this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
how can you turn we into this , after you just teach me how to kiss you . 
i tell you i 'd never say goodbye . 
now i 'm slip on the tear you make me cry . 
but 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
why do it come as a surprise to think this i be so naive . 
maybe do n't mean so much . 
but it mean everything to me . 
but 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get . 
this 's what i get .
