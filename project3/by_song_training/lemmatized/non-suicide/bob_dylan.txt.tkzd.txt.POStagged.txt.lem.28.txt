#you're a big girl now we conversation be short and sweet . 
it nearly sweep me off of me foot . 
and i 'm back in the rain . 
oh , and you be on dry land . 
you make it there somehow . 
you 're a big girl now . 
bird on the horizon sit on a fence , he 's sing he song for me at he own expense . 
and i 'm just like this bird , oh , sing just for you . 
i hope this you can hear , hear me sing through this tear . 
time be a jet plane . 
it move too fast . 
oh , but what a shame this all we 've share ca n't last . 
i can change , i swear . 
oh , see what you can do . 
i can make it through . 
you can make it , too . 
love be so simple , to quote a phrase . 
you 've know it all the time . 
i 'm learn it this day . 
oh , i know where i can find you , oh , in somebody 's room . 
it 's a price i have to pay . 
you 're a big girl all the way . 
a change in the weather be know to be extreme , but what 's the sense of change horse in midstream ? 
i 'm go out of me mind , oh , with a pain this stop and start like a corkscrew to me heart ever since we 've be apart .
