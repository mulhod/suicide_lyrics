california ( hustle and flow ) run around like you 're front page news , lonely eye and you motorcycle boot . 
tattoo heart and you jet-black hair , run round like you do n't care . 
take me down , take me on down the line . 
well , i be bear , babe , with nothing to lose , but the black man teach me how to sing the blue . 
make a little life outta rock and roll and this crazy california hustle and flow . 
take me down , take me on down the line . 
shake me down , shake me on down the line . 
i wend too fast with this rhythm and booze almost end up dead like all this other fool . 
everyone 's get some sort of ball and chain . 
what 's life without a little pain ? 
take me down , take me on down the line . 
shake me down , shake me on down the line . 
live in a hollywood movie dream , and i 'm still reach for the star . 
life get hard and then it get good . 
like i always know it will . 
run around like you 're front page news , lonely eye and you motorcycle boot . 
tattoo heart and you jet-black hair , run round like you do n't care . 
take me down , take me on down the line . 
shake me down , shake me on down the line . 
take me down , take me on down the line . 
shake me down , shake me on down the line .
