#zero-sum they 're start to open up the sky . 
they 're start to reach down through . 
and it feel like we 're live in this split-second of a car crash . 
and time be slow down . 
and if we only have a little more time . 
and this time be all there be . 
do you remember the time we ... and all the time we ... and should have ... and be go to... 
i know , and i know you remember how we can justify it all , and we know well . 
in we heart we know well . 
and we tell we it do n't matter , and we choose to continue , and none of this matter anymore in the hour of we twilight . 
and soon it will be all say and do . 
and we will all be back together as one . 
if we will continue at all . 
shame on we , doom from the start . 
may god have mercy on we dirty little heart . 
shame on we for all we 've do , and all we ever be , just zero and one . 
and you never get away . 
and you never get to take the easy way . 
and all of this be a consequence bring on by we own hand , if you believe in this sort of thing . 
and do you ever really find , when you close you eye , any place this be still and at peace ? 
and i guess i just want to tell you , as the light start to fade , this you be the reason this i be not afraid . 
and i guess i just want to mention , as the heaven will fall , we will be together soon if we will be anything at all . 
shame on we , doom from the start . 
may god have mercy on we dirty little heart . 
shame on we for all we 've do , and all we ever be , just zero and one .
