#shooting star you 'll make the scene like you always do , go upstream down the avenue to fuck some trophy boy this you 'll win tonight at the bar . 
so bad , so far . 
you 'll make he sad , shoot star . 
when it be me , i be momentarily proud , drink on dream now i 'm glad i do n't say out loud . 
you say you 'd be for real , but i do n't believe this you be . 
so bad , so far . 
you make me sad , shoot star . 
you 're distant and cold and a sight to behold . 
everybody just sigh . 
but no one get on with you very long because you do n't feel bad when you lie . 
i 'm go to sleep now , go back to find square one . 
square two be where i can deal with the shit you 've just do . 
it wo n't be soon . 
say the less , it 's go to be hard . 
so bad , so far . 
you love be sad , shoot star . 
you love be sad , shoot star .
