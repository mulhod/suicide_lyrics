#isolation in fear every day , every even , he call he aloud from above , carefully watch for a reason , painstaking devotion and love , surrender to self-preservation from others who care for they , a blindness this touch perfection , , but hurt just like anything else . 
isolation , isolation , isolation . 
mother , i try . 
please believe me . 
i 'm do the well this i can . 
i 'm ashamed of the thing i 've be put through . 
i 'm ashamed of the person i be . 
isolation , isolation , isolation . 
but if you can just see the beauty , this thing i can never describe , this pleasure a wayward distraction . 
this be me one lucky prize . 
isolation , isolation , isolation .
