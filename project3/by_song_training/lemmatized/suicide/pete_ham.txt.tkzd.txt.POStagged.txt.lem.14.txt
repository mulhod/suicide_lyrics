#knocking down we home you heart be in you home , they say . 
you home 's where you belong . 
but someone steal me heart today , so listen to me song . 
i hear the news today . 
they 're go to move we far away . 
seem this we home must go . 
they 're go to build a motorway . 
it be n't fair . 
nobody care . 
they 're knock down we home , ruin all we own . 
they 're knock down we home . 
please help we . 
do n't let they take we home . 
ma 's cook at the stave , where he 's cook for thirty year . 
ten thousand meal he 's cook , but now he eye be fill with tear . 
it be n't fair . 
nobody care . 
they 're knock down we home , ruin all we own .
