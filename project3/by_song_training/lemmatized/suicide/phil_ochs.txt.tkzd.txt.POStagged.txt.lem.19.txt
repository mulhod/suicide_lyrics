#lou marsh on the street of new york city when the hour be get late , there be young man arm with knives and gun , young man arm with hate . 
and lou marsh step between they and die there in he track for one man be no army when the city turn it back . 
and now the street be empty . 
now the street be dark , so keep an eye on shadow and never pass the park for the city be a jungle when the law be out of sight and death lurk in el barrio with the orphan of the night . 
he leave behind a chamber of a church he serve so long for he learn the prayer of distant man will never right the wrong . 
he church become an alley and he pulpit be the street and he make he congregation from the boy he use to meet . 
and now the street be empty . 
now the street be dark , so keep an eye on shadow and never pass the park for the city be a jungle when the law be out of sight and death lurk in el barrio with the orphan of the night . 
there be two gang approach in spanish harlem town .

and now the street be empty . 
now the street be dark , so keep an eye on shadow and never pass the park for the city be a jungle when the law be out of sight and death lurk in el barrio with the orphan of the night .
