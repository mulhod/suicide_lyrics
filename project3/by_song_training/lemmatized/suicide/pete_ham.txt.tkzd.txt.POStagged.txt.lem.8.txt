#crimson ship me life be color , paint picture out of tune . 
you come from nowhere in a song . 
it may have be the way i laugh . 
he make the joke can only show me what be wrong . 
he take me fly on he crimson ship . 
he never leave me he number . 
he take me fly on he crimson ship . 
then he be go and i wonder . 
who put the knot on all the cross on the hill ? 
why do the old man wash he hand ? 
who grow the flower this be big enough to kill and blow the trumpet in the van ? 
he take me fly on he crimson ship . 
he never leave me he number . 
he take me fly on he crimson ship . 
then he be go and i wonder . 
oh , oh , oh , oh . 
when they be busy throw kiss at the moon , a father lose he mother 's son and , though they know the resurrection will be soon , the time be spend . 
they carry on , on . 
he take me fly on he crimson ship . 
he never leave me he number . 
he take me fly on he crimson ship then he be go and i wonder , wonder , wonder , wonder .
