# a pass feel everything be go but the echo of the burst of a shell and i 'm stick here wait for a pass feel in the city i build up and blow to hell . 
i 'm stick here wait for a pass feel . 
still i sin all the time . 
me request for relief down the dead power line though i 'm beyond belief in the help i require just to exist at all . 
take a long time to stand . 
take an hour to fall .
