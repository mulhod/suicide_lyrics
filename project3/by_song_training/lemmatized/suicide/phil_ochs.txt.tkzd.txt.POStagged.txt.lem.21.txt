#celia 
when the wind from the island be roll through the tree , when a kiss from a prison cell be carry in the breeze , this 's when i wonder how sad a man can be . 
oh , when will celia come to me ? 
i still remember the mountain of the war , sierra madre and the philipino shear . 
when will i lie beside me celia beneath the tree ? 
oh , when will celia come to me ? 
so many year be steal . 
so many year be go . 
and the vision of me celia make dream to dream upon . 
each hour be a day fill with memory . 
oh , when will celia come to me ? 
i wake each morning and i watch the sun arise , wonder if me celia sleep , wonder if he cry . 
if hate must be me prison lock , love must be the key . 
oh , when will celia come to me ? 
the gun have stop they fire . 
you may wander through the hill . 
they keep me celia through the war . 
they keep he from me still . 
he wait upon island now , a prisoner of the sea . 
oh , when will celia come to me ? 
when the wind from the island be roll through the tree , when a kiss from a prison cell be carry in the breeze , this 's when i wonder how sad a man can be . 
oh , when will celia come to me ? 
oh , when will celia come to me ?
