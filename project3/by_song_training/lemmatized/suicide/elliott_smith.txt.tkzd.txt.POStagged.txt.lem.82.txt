# no name # 3rd we arrive too late . 
we mouth be open . 
i turn off the light . 
so come on night . 
you 're a witness , you . 
you 've see me interrupt a good old-fashioned fight . 
so come on night . 
everyone be go , home to oblivion , home to oblivion , home to oblivion . 
watch the dying day blush in the sky . 
everyone be uptight . 
so come on night . 
everyone be go , home to oblivion , home to oblivion , home to oblivion . 
i know we 're not illegitimate in we hear . 
so come on , so come on night .
