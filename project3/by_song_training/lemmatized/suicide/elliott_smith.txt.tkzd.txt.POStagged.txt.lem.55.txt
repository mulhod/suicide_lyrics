#talking to mary talk to mary , you know you do n't have to shout . 
he can hear what you 're think like you 're say it right out loud . 
he see behind this dirty look . 
it be he this follow down every stupid turn this you take . 
one day he 'll go . 
i tell you so . 
one day he 'll go . 
i tell you so . 
see the one big problem you keep under you hat and it 's pretty unlikely this anybody else will be cool with this . 
you get bus fare in you pocket and more money down in you sock , but he ca n't tell you how to contact he if you wo n't listen to he talk . 
one day he 'll go . 
i tell you so . 
one day he 'll go . 
i tell you so . 
it 's no problem . 
i 'll just keep quiet if it 's easy for you to make believe in this i do n't love you as much as i do . 
one day he 'll go . 
i tell you so . 
one day he 'll go . 
i tell you so . 
i tell you so . 
i tell you so .
