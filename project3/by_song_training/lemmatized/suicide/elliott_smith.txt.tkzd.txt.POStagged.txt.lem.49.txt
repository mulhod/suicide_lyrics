#last hour here 's the army this you mow to the grind and the body you leave lie around . 
talk it out the last hour . 
i 'm through try now . 
it 's a big relief . 
i 'll be stay down where no one else go to give me grief , mess me around . 
just make it over . 
you opinion be the law of the land , a single thing this i can n't always understand . 
i live it out from hour to hour , the only thing this never really change . 
you run me all around and drag me down at the end of the day . 
do n't keep me around . 
just make it over . 
i 've be think of the thing this i miss , situation this i pass up for this one-way love i take for we . 
i 'm through try now . 
it 's a big relief . 
i 'll be stay down . 
i be n't good at be a thief , more like a clown . 
make it over .
