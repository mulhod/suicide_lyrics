#chords of fame i find he by the stage last night . 
he be breathe he last breath . 
a bottle of gin and a cigarette be all this he have leave . 
i can see you make the music because you carry a guitar , but , god , help the troubadour who try to be a star . 
so play the chord of love , me friend . 
play the chord of pain . 
if you want to keep you song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chord of fame . 
i 've see me share of hustler as they try to take the world . 
when they find they melody , they 're surround by the girl . 
but it all fade so quickly , like a sunny summer day . 
reporter ask you question . 
they write down what you say . 
so play the chord of love , me friend . 
play the chord of pain . 
if you want to keep you song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chord of fame . 
so play the chord of love , me friend . 
play the chord of pain . 
if you want to keep you song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chord of fame . 
they will rob you of you innocence . 
they will put you up for sale . 
more this you will find success , the more this you will fail . 
i 've be around . 
i 've have me share and i really ca n't complain , but i wonder who i leave behind the other side of fame . 
so play the chord of love , me friend . 
play the chord of pain . 
if you want to keep you song , do n't , do n't , do n't , do n't play the chord of fame .
