#sweet adeline cut this picture into you and me . 
burn it backward . 
kill this history . 
make it over . 
make it stay away or hate 'll say the end this love start to stay . 
there 's a kid a floor below me say , brother , can you spare sunshine for a brother ? 
old man winter 's in the air . 
walk me up a story , ask how you be . 
tell me not to worry , you be just a shoot star . 
sweet adeline , sweet adeline , me clementine , sweet adeline . 
it 's a picture-perfect even and i 'm stare down the sun , fully load , deaf and dumb and do , wait for sedation to disconnect me head or any situation where i 'm well off than dead .
