#last call last call , he be sick of it all , asleep at home . 
tell you off and goodbye . 
well , you know one day it 'll come to haunt you , this you do n't tell he quite the truth . 
you 're a crisis . 
you 're a icicle . 
you 're a tongueless talker . 
you do n't care what you say . 
you 're a jaywalker and you just just walk away and this 's all you do . 
the clap of the fading-out sound of you shoe make he wonder who he think this he know . 
last call , he be sick of it all . 
the endless stream of reminder make he so sick of you , sick of you , sick of you , sick of you sound , sick of you come around try to crawl under me skin when i already shed me well defense . 
it come out all around this you win and i think i 'm all do . 
you can switch me off safely while i 'm lie here wait for sleep to overtake me . 
yeah , yeah , you 're still here , but just check to make sure . 
all you aspire to do be endure . 
you ca n't ask for more , ask for none , know you 'll never get this which you ask for , so you cast you shadow everywhere like the man in the moon . 
you start to drink . 
you just want to continue . 
it 'll all be yesteryear soon . 
you start to drink . 
you just want to continue . 
it 'll all be yesteryear soon . 
church bell and now i 'm awake and i guess it must be some kind of holiday . 
i ca n't be see to join in the celebration , but i 'll go to the service and i 'll go to pray and i 'll sing the praise of me maker 's name like i be as good as he make me and i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me , i want he to tell me this he will never wake me . 
i 'm lie here wait for sleep to overtake me .
