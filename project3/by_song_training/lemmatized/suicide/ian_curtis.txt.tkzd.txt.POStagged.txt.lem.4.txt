#colony a cry for help . 
a hint of anaesthesia . 
the sound from break home . 
we use to always meet here . 
as he lay asleep , he take he in he arm . 
some thing i have to do , but i do n't mean you harm . 
a worry parent 's glance . 
a kiss . 
a last goodbye . 
hand he the bag he pack . 
the tear he try to hide . 
a cruel wind this blow down to we lunacy and leave he stand cold here in this colony . 
i ca n't see why all this confrontation . 
i ca n't see why all this dislocation . 
no family life . 
this make me feel uneasy . 
stand alone here in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony . 
dear , god in he wisdom take you by the hand . 
god in he wisdom make you understand . 
god in he wisdom take you by the hand . 
god in he wisdom make you understand . 
god in he wisdom take you by the hand . 
god in he wisdom make you understand . 
god in he wisdom take you by the hand . 
god in he wisdom make you understand in this colony , in this colony , in this colony , in this colony .
