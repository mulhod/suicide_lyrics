#perfection there be no real perfection . 
there 'll be no perfect day . 
just love be we connection , the truth in what we say . 
there 's no good revolution , just power change hand . 
there be no straight solution , except to understand . 
so listen to me song of life . 
you do n't need a gun or a knife . 
successful conversation will take you very far . 
there be no real perfection . 
there 'll be no perfect man . 
just peace be we connection , forgive all you can . 
there 's no good kind of kill , just power take life . 
it 's all good blood this 's spill to make a big knife . 
so listen to me song of life . 
you do n't need a gun or a knife . 
successful conversation will take you very far . 
successful conversation will take you very far . 
so listen to me song of life . 
you do n't need a gun or a knife . 
successful conversation will take you very far . 
successful conversation will take you very far .
