#heart and soul instinct this can still betray we . 
a journey this lead to the sun . 
soulless and bend on destruction . 
a struggle between right and wrong . 
you take me place in the showdown . 
i 'll observe with a pitiful eye . 
i 'd humbly ask for forgiveness , a request well beyond you and i . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
an abyss this laugh at creation . 
a circus complete with all fool . 
foundation this last the age , then rip apart at they root . 
beyond all this good be the terror , the grip of a mercenary hand , when savagery turn all good reason . 
there 's no turn back , no last stand . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
existence . 
well , what do it matter ? 
i exist on the well term i can . 
the past be now part of me future . 
the present be well out of hand . 
the present be well out of hand . 
heart and soul , one will burn . 
heart and soul , one will burn , one will burn , one will burn . 
heart and soul , one will burn .
