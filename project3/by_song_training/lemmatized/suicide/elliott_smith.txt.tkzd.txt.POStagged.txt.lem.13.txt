#needle in the hay you hand on he arm , the hay-stack charm around you neck , string out and thin , call some friend , try to cash some check . 
he 's act dumb . 
this 's what you 've come to expect . 
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay . 
he 's wear you clothe , head down to toe , a reaction to you . 
you say you know what he do , but you idiot kid , you do n't have a clue . 
sometime they just get catch in the eye you 're pull he through . 
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay . 
now on the bus , nearly touch this dirty retreat , fall out , 6th and powell , a dead sweat in me teeth . 
go to walk , walk , walk four more block plus the one in me brain , down downstairs to the man . 
he 's go to make it all okay . 
i ca n't beat me , i ca n't beat me and i do n't want to talk . 
i 'm take the cure , so i can be quiet whenever i want . 
so leave me alone . 
you ought to be proud this i 'm get good mark . 
needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay , needle in the hay .
