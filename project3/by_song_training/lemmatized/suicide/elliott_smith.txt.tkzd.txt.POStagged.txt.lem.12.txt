#say yes i 'm in love with the world through the eye of a girl who 's still around the morning after . 
we break up a month ago and i grow up . 
i do n't know i 'd be around the morning after . 
it 's always be wait and see , a happy day and then you pay and feel like shit the morning after . 
but now i feel change around and instead of fall down i 'm stand up the morning after . 
situation get fuck up and turn around sooner or late . 
and i can be another fool or an exception to the rule . 
you tell me the morning after . 
crook spin ca n't come to rest . 
i 'm damage bad at well . 
he 'll decide what he want . 
i 'll probably be the last to know . 
no one say until it show and you see how it be . 
they want you or they do n't . 
say yes . 
i 'm in love with the world through the eye of a girl who 's still around the morning after .
