#shadowplay to the centre of the city where all road meet wait for you , to the depth of the ocean where all hope sink search for you , i be move through the silence without motion , wait for you . 
in a room with a window in the corner i find truth . 
in the shadow-play , act out you own death , know no more , as the assassin all group in four line , dance on the floor , and with cold steel , odor on they body make a move to connect , but i can only stare in disbelief as the crowd all leave . 
i do everything , everything i want to . 
i let they use you for they own end . 
to the center of the city in the night wait for you . 
to the center of the city in the night wait for you .
