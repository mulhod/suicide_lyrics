#angel in the snow i 'd say you make a perfect angel in the snow , all crush out on the way you be . 
well stop before it go too far . 
do n't you know this i love you ? 
sometime i feel like only a cold , still life this fall down here to lie beside you . 
do n't you know this i love you ? 
sometime i feel like only a cold , still life , only a freeze , still life this fall down here to lie beside you .
