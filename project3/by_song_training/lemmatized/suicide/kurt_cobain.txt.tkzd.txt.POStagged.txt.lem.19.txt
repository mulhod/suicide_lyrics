#dumb i 'm not like they , but i can pretend . 
the sun be go , but i have a light . 
the day be do , but i 'm have fun . 
i think i 'm dumb or maybe just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy . 
me heart be break , but i have some glue . 
help me inhale and mend it with you . 
we 'll float around and hang out on cloud . 
then we 'll come down and have a hangover , have a hangover , have a hangover , have a hangover . 
skin the sun . 
fall asleep. wish away . 
the soul be cheap . 
lesson learn . 
wish me luck . 
soothe the burn . 
wake me up . 
i 'm not like they , but i can pretend . 
the sun be go , but i have a light . 
me day be do , but i 'm have fun . 
i think i 'm dumb , maybe just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy , think i 'm just happy . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb . 
i think i 'm dumb .
