#insight guess you dream always end . 
they do n't rise up , just descend . 
but i do n't care anymore . 
i 've lose the will to want more . 
i 'm not afraid , not at all . 
i watch they all as they fall , but i remember when we be young . 
this with habit of waste , they sense of style and good taste , of make sure you be right . 
hey , do n't you know you be right ? 
i 'm not afraid anymore . 
i keep me eye on the door , but i remember . 
tear of sadness for you , more upheaval for you reflect a moment in time , a special moment in time . 
yeah , we waste we time , we do n't really have time , but we remember when we be young . 
and all god 's angel beware and all you judge beware . 
son of chance , take good care for all the people not there . 
i 'm not afraid anymore . 
i 'm not afraid anymore . 
i 'm not afraid anymore . 
oh , i 'm not afraid anymore .
