#exercise one when you 're look at life in a strange new room , maybe drown soon , be this the start of it all ? 
turn on you tv. turn down you pulse . 
turn away from it all . 
it 's all get too much . 
when you 're look at life , decipher scar . 
just who fool who ? 
sit still in they car . 
the light look bright when you reach outside , time for one last ride before the end of it all .
