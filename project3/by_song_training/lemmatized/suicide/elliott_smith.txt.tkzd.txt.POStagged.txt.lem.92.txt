#bled white i 'm a color reporter ( rise city on the 409 ) , but the city 's be bleed white ( white city on the yellow line ) . 
and the doctor order ( drink till he 's trash be just a waste of time ) . 
he drink all night to take away this curse , but it make me feel much worse . 
bleed white . 
so i wait for the f-train ( white city on the yellow line ) and connect through a friend of me ( white city to a friend of me ) to a yesterday-dream (yesterday a dream be just a waste of time ) because i 'll have to be high to track the sunset down and paint this pailing town . 
bleed white . 
so here he come with a blank expression , especially for me because he know i feel the same because happy and sad come in quick succession . 
i 'm never go to become what you become . 
do n't you dare disturb me ( do n't complicate me piece of mind ) while i 'm balance me past ( do n't complicate me piece of mind ) because you ca n't help or hurt me ( the anger , be mean be just a waste of time ) like it already have . 
it may not seem quite right , but i 'm not fuck , not quite . 
bleed white . 
bleed white .
