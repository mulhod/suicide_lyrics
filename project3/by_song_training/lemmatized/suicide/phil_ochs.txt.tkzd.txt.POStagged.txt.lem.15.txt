# the trial outside the cat be scratch . 
inside the door be latch . 
on the room , the greedy gloom , the trial be reveal . 
police be six foot deep with switchblade in they teeth , so no one leave and they all believe this be absolutely real . 
yes , it 's real . 
and the sergeant say , "are you ready , boy ? 
get ready , boy . 
aim and fire . 
" order in the court . 
people ready for the sport . 
they squirm and squeak and lick they beak and grease they feather down . 
everybody rise . 
judge be here with bathroom eye . 
a grizzly bear , he hug he chair and the greedy gavel pound . 
yes , it pound . 
and the sergeant say , "are you ready , boy ? 
get ready , boy . 
aim and fire . 
" in the dungeon fall , write appeal upon the wall , and the priest in prayer be not even there , so precious be he time . 
to the stake he 's tie . 
the swallow sing . 
the trigger slide . 
he bid goodbye to the watery sky this plunge from he mind , from he mind . 
and the sergeant say , "are you ready , boy ? 
get ready , boy . 
aim and fire .
