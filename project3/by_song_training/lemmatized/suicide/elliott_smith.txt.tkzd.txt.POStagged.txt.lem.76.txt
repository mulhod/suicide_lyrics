#see you late i get a choke-chain make out of night-rain to keep you memory down in quicksand from the main man , to drown everything out . 
we be out on a joyride , fuck up from inside , always at a dead stall from stick pin into miniature man who ca n't feel it at all . 
see you late . 
see you late if i see you at all . 
see you late . 
walk through thick mud look for new blood , think i hear you name , cruel imagination still give you pain just to find you with you master-minder run you affair , say how you well now since it kill all you other care . 
see you late . 
see you late if i see you at all . 
see you late . 
see you late if i see you at all . 
see you late . 
see you late if i see you at all . 
see you late .
