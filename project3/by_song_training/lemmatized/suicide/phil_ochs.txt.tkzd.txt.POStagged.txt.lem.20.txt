#power and the glory come and take a walk with me through this green and grow land . 
walk through the meadow and the mountain and the sand . 
walk through the valley and the river and the plain . 
walk through the sun and walk through the rain . 
here be a land full of power and glory , beauty this word can recall . 
oh , he power shall rest on the strength of he freedom . 
he glory shall rest on we all , on we all . 
from colorado , kansas , and the carolinas too , virginia and alaska , from the old to the new , texas and ohio and the california shear , tell me , who can ask for more ? 
yet he 's only as rich as the poor of he poor , only as free as the padlock prison door , only as strong as we love for this land , only as tall as we stand . 
but we land be still trouble by man who have to hate . 
they twist away we freedom and they twist away we fate . 
fear be they weapon and treason be they cry . 
we can stop they if we try .
