#interzone i walk through the city limit . 
someone talk me in to do it . 
attract by some force within it , fad to close me eye to get close to it . 
around a corner where a prophet lie , see the place where he have a room to stay , a wire fence where the child play . 
see the be where the body lie and i be look for a friend of me . 
and i have no time to waste . 
yeah , look for some friend of me . 
the car screech . 
hear the sound on dust . 
hear a noise . 
just a car outside , metallic blue turn red with rust . 
pull in close by the build 's side in a group , all forget youth . 
have to think , collect . 
me sense now be turn onto a knife-edged view . 
find some place where me friend do n't know . 
and i be look for a friend of me . 
and i have no time to waste . 
yeah , look for some friend of me . 
down the dark street the house look the same . 
get dark now . 
face look the same . 
and i walk around and around . 
no stomach . 
tear apart . 
nail me to a train . 
have to think again . 
try to find a clue . 
try to find a way to get out ! 
try to move away . 
have to move away and keep out . 
four , twelve window , ten in a row , behind a wall . 
well , i look down low . 
the light shine like a neon show . 
insert deep . 
feel a warm glow . 
no place to stop . 
no place to go . 
no time to lose . 
have to keep on go . 
i guess they die some time ago . 
i guess they die some time ago . 
and i be look for a friend of me . 
and i have no time to waste . 
yeah , look for some friend of me .
