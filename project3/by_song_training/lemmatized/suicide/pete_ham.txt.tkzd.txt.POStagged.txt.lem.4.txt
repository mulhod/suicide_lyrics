#shine on shine on , shine on me . 
all i know be now i want you close to me . 
i ca n't really tell you what the future 's go to be . 
just for now , little lady , shine on me . 
lean on , lean on me . 
something tell me this 's the way it 's gotta be . 
i ca n't really show you what the future 's go to be . 
just for now , little lady , lean on me . 
to fall in love with love be maybe just a fantasy and promise we make can be insane . 
do n't think of tomorrow . 
yesterday be past . 
and , if you can , you know we can make it last . 
drink on , drink on me . 
slip and slide , so i 'll forget reality . 
i ca n't really say if i 'll come on and get so free . 
just for now , little lady , drink on me . 
to fall in love with love be maybe just a fantasy and promise we make can be insane . 
do n't think of tomorrow . 
yesterday be past . 
and , if you can , you know we can make it last . 
shine on , shine on me . 
all i know be now i want you close to me . 
i ca n't really tell you what the future 's go to be . 
just for now , little lady , shine on me . 
just for now , little lady , shine on me . 
just for now , little lady , shine on me .
