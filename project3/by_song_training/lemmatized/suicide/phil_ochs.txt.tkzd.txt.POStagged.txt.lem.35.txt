i never should have leave me home , never leave the farm , but the city be excitin . 
it can n't do me any harm . 
the more folk i run across , the less i seem to know . 
the day go by too quickly . 
the night go by too slow . 
fill he up with love , please , wo n't you , mister ?

i believe i 'll turn to drink , so i wo n't remember , so i wo n't have to think . 
tomorrow will bring happiness or at less another day , so i will bid farewell and i 'll be on me way . 
fill he up with love , please , wo n't you , mister ? 
just the hi-test be what i use to say , but this be before i lose me baby . 
i 'll have a dollar 's worth of regular today .
