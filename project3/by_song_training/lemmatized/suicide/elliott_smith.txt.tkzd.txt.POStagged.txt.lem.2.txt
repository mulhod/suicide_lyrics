#alameda 
you walk down alameda shuffle you deck of trick card over everyone like some precious only son face down , bow to the champion . 
you walk down alameda look at the crack in the sidewalk , think about you friend , how you maintain all they in a constant state of suspense for you own protection over they affection . 
nobody break you heart . 
you break you own because you ca n't finish what you start . 
walk down alameda brush off the nightmare you wish can plague me when i 'm awake and now you see you first mistake be think this you can relate . 
for one or two minute he like you , but the fix be in . 
you 're all pretension . 
i never pay attention . 
nobody break you heart . 
you break you own because you ca n't finish what you start . 
nobody break you heart . 
you break you own because you ca n't finish what you start . 
nobody break you heart . 
you break you own because you ca n't finish what you start . 
nobody break you heart . 
if you 're alone , it must be you this want to be apart .
