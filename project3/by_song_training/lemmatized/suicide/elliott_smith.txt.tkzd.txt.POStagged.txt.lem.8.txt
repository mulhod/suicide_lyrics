#punch and judy a wallflower punch talk to judy in a crowd corner where anybody can listen in , but they do n't read page to page or speak easy . 
now they 're go to go say the word in the wrong order again . 
they walk in a circle through all the sidewalk scene they use to be a part of one time . 
now everybody just stare and whisper , drive around up and down division street . 
i use to like it here . 
it just bum me out to remember . 
ca n't you ever treat anyone nice ? 
i think i 'm go to make the same mistake twice . 
they draw the curtain , wait for a call . 
pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all . 
ca n't you ever treat anyone nice ? 
i think i 'm go to make the same mistake twice . 
i 'm go to make the same mistake twice .
