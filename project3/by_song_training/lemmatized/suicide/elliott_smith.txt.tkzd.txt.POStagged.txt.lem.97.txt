# a question mark i get a question mark . 
i get a need to always take some shoot in the dark . 
i do n't have to make pretend the picture i 'm in be totally clearly . 
you think this all thing have a way they ought to appear because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know i do n't . 
i dream . 
do n't know what you mean . 
panic call you out and take you in , give you an easy game and let you win . 
you 're give back a little hatred now to the world because it treat you bad , because you can n't keep the great unknown from make you mad , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know i do n't . 
i dream . 
do n't know what you mean . 
say you final word , but honesty and love can 've keep we together . 
one day you 'll see it 's worth it after all . 
if you ever want to say you 're sorry , you can give me a call .
