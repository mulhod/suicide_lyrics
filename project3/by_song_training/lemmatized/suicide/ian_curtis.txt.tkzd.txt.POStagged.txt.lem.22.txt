#novelty when people listen to you , do n't you know it mean a lot because you 've get to work so hard for everything you 've get . 
ca n't rest on you laurel now , not when you 've get none . 
you 'll find you in a gutter , right back where you come from . 
someone tell me be in the know be the main thing . 
we all need the security this belong bring . 
ca n't stand on you own in this time , against all the odds . 
you all just fall behind like all the other sod . 
you slap we back and pretend you know about all the thing this we be go to do . 
what you go to do ? 
what you go to do when it 's over ? 
you 're on you own now . 
do n't you think this 's a shame ? 
but you 're the only one responsible to take the blame . 
so what you go to do when the novelty have go ? 
yeah , what you go to do when the novelty have go ? 
you slap we back and pretend you know about all the thing we be go to do . 
what you go to do ? 
what you go to do when it 's over ?
