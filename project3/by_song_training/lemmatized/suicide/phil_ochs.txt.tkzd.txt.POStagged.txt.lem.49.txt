#hills of west virginia from the flat plain of ohio we drift out one day for the southern part of the journey . 
underneath the bridge , the ohio river sing as we head for the hill of west virginia . 
and the red sun of the morning be smile through the tree as the darkness of the night be quickly fade and the fog hug the road like a cloudy , cloudy sea as we drive though the hill of west virginia . 
we smoke the tobacco and drink of the wine and we speak of the forest we be pass . 
and the road will wind and wind and wind when we drive through the hill of west virginia . 
among all the wealth of the beauty this we pass , there be many old shack grow old . 
and we see the break bottle lay on the grass when we drive though the hill of west virginia . 
the virginia people watch as we wend ride by . 
oh , proud as a boulder they be stand . 
and we wonder at each other with a meet of the eye when we drive think the hill of west virginia . 
and once in a while we will stop by the road and gaze at the womb of the valley , almost wish for a path down below , where we stop in the hill of west virginia . 
up and down and all around we take we restless ride and the rock , they be stare cold and jag , where explosion of the powder have tear away the side , where we drive through the hill of west virginia . 
and the orange sun be fall on the southern border-line as the shadow of the night be now return .
