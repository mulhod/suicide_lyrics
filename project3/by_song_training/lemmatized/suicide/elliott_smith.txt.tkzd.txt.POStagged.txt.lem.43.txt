#do n't go down i meet a girl , snowball , in hell . 
he be hard and as crack as the liberty bell . 
i get he to come on and move in with me and i say i 'd find a well place . 
we can spend eternity . 
do n't go down . 
do n't go down . 
stay with me , baby , stay . 
he mama call me a thief and he dad call he commander in chief . 
i fight he off with me love , but i know the sense of worthlessness he will have to raise above . 
do n't go down . 
do n't go down . 
stay with me , baby , stay . 
do n't go down . 
do n't go down . 
stay with me , baby , stay . 
he have a dream , wake up in shock . 
he have see he own body outline in chalk . 
i split the scene , the globe be spin , and he ghost lean down to kiss me with a message from the sun . 
do n't go down . 
do n't go down . 
stay with me , baby , stay . 
do n't go down . 
stay with me , baby , stay . 
do n't go down . 
stay with me , baby , stay .
