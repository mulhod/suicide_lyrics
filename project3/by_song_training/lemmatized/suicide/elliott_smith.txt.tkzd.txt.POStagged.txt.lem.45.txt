#fond farewell the litebrite 's now black and white because you take apart a picture this be n't right . 
pitch burn on a shine sheet , the only maker this you 'd want to meet . 
a dying man in a live room who shadow pace the floor , who 'll take you out in the open door . 
this be not me life . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend . 
it 's not what i 'm like . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who can n't get thing right . 
fond farewell to a friend . 
he say , really , i just want to dance . 
good and evil match perfect . 
it 's a great romance . 
i can deal with some psychic pain if it 'll slow down me high brain . 
vein full of disappear ink , vomit in the kitchen sink , disconnect from the miss link . 
this be not me life . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend . 
it 's not what i 'm like . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who can n't get thing right . 
fond farewell to a friend . 
i see you 're leave me and take up with the enemy , the cold comfort of the in between , a little less than a human be , a little less than a happy high , a little less than a suicide , the only thing this you really try . 
this be not me life . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend . 
it 's not what i 'm like . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend who can n't get thing right . 
fond farewell to a friend . 
this be not me life . 
it 's just a fond farewell to a friend .
