#i remember nothing we be stranger . 
we be stranger for way too long , for way too long . 
we be stranger for way too long . 
violent , violent . 
be stranger . 
get weak all the time . 
may just pass the time . 
me in me own world and you there beside . 
the gap be enormous . 
we stare from each side . 
we be stranger for way too long . 
violent , more violent , he hand crack the chair , move on reaction , then slump in despair . 
trap in a cage and surrender too soon . 
me in me own world , the one this you know for way too long . 
we be stranger for way too long . 
we be stranger . 
we be stranger for way too long , for way too long .
