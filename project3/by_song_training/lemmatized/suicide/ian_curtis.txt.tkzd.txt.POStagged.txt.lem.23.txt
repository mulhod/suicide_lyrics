#these day morning seem strange , almost out of place . 
search hard for you and you special way . 
this day , this day . 
spend all me time . 
learn a killer 's art . 
take threat and abuse till i 'd learn the part . 
can you stay for this day ? 
this day , this day . 
use outward deception to get away , break heart romance to make it pay . 
this day , this day . 
we 'll drift through it all . 
it 's the modern age . 
take care of it all now this debt be pay . 
can you stay for this day ?
