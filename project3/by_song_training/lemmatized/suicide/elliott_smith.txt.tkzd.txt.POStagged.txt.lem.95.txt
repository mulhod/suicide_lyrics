#oh well okay here 's the silhouette , the face always turn away , the bleed color go to black , dying like a day . 
can n't figure out what make you so unhappy . 
shake you head to say no , no , no and stop for a spell and stay this way . 
oh , well , okay . 
i get picture . 
i just do n't see it anymore . 
climb hour upon hour through a total bear with the one i keep where it never fade in the safety of a pitch-black mind , an airless cell this block the day . 
oh , well , okay . 
if you a get a feel the next time you see me , do me a favor and let me know because it 's hard to tell , it 's hard to say . 
oh , well , okay . 
oh , well , okay . 
oh , well , okay .
