#ice age i 've see the real atrocity , bury in the sand , stockpile for safety while we stand hold hand . 
i 'm live in the ice age . 
i 'm live in the ice age . 
nothing will hold . 
nothing will fit into the cold . 
it 's not an eclipse . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
search for another way , hide behind the door . 
we 'll live in hole and disused shaft , hope for little more . 
i 'm live in the ice age . 
i 'm live in the ice age . 
nothing will hold . 
nothing will fit into the cold . 
no smile on you lip . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age . 
live in the ice age .
