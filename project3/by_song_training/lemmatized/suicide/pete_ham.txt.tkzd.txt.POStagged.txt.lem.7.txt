#lonely you when i look into you tearful eye , i do n't know what to do . 
and , though you say this i do n't realize , i sympathize with you . 
lonely you , only you . 
yes , i do . 
lonely you , only you . 
lonely you . 
when i ask you just to be me friend , i want to lend a hand , but , if we get too close , it 's sure to end . 
oh , ca n't you understand ? 
lonely you , only you . 
yes , it will . 
lonely you , only you . 
lonely you . 
we really need a friend and friend be hard to find and hard still to keep. lonely you . 
lonely me . 
lonely you , only you . 
yes , it will . 
lonely you , only you . 
lonely you . 
lonely you . 
lonely you .
