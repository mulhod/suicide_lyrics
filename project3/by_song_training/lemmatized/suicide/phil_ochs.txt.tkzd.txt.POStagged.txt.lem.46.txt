#iron lady have you see the iron lady 's charm , leg of steel , leather on he arm , take on a man to die ? 
a life for a life . 
an eye for an eye . 
and death 's the iron lady in the chair . 
stop the murder . 
deter the crime away . 
only kill show this kill do n't pay . 
yes , this 's the kind of law it take even though we make mistake and sometime send the wrong man to the chair . 
in the death-row wait for they turn , no time to change , not a chance to learn , wait for someone to call , say , "it 's over , after all . 
" they wo n't have to face the justice of the chair . 
just before they serve he one last meal , shave he head , they ask he how he feel . 
then the warden come to say goodbye . 
reporter come to watch he die , watch he as he 's strap into the chair . 
and the chaplain , he read the final prayer . 
be brave , me son . 
the lord be wait there . 
oh , murder be so wrong , you see . 
both the bible and the court agree this the state 's allow to murder in the chair . 
in the courtroom , watch the balance of the scale . 
if the price be right , there 's time for more appeal . 
the string be pull , the switch be stay , the fine lawyer ' fee be pay and a rich man never die upon the chair . 
have you see the iron lady 's charm , leg of steel , leather on he arm , take on a man to die ? 
a life for a life . 
an eye for an eye . 
and death 's the iron lady in the chair .
