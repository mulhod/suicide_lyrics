#new monkey here come the sidewalk-boss again , tell me how i ca n't cave in , this i 'm a study in black , need a pat on the back . 
i look up and smile , a picture of dissatisfaction this he can only see as a junkie . 
though i may be straight as an arrow , he 's busy shake hand with me monkey , busy shake hand with me monkey . 
i go in me car straight to the bar where me sweetie pour the beer for the million of fan ignore the band . 
he 's in me ear , want me to live in denial , say you 've get to settle for something . 
though it may not be really live , anything be well than nothing , anything be well than nothing . 
no happy action-man go to move in to take me place . 
i 'll be pump out the product , just a total waste . 
look at you hand unoccupied . 
look at the length you 'll go to hide . 
you 're under the veil , pretend to fail , get a whole lot of empty time leave to go . 
now you 've get to fill it with something . 
i know what you can do . 
do n't you know anything be well than nothing ? 
no happy action-man go to move in to take me place . 
i 'll be pump out the product , just a total waste . 
i 'm here with me cup , afraid to look up . 
this be how i spend me time , laze around , head hang down , stick inside me imagination , busy make something from nothing , picture of hope and depression . 
anything be well than nothing . 
anything be well than nothing . 
anything be well than nothing . 
anything be well than nothing .
