# the thresher in portsmouth town on the eastern shear where many a fine ship be bear , the thresher be build and the thresher be launch and the crow of the thresher be swear . 
he be shape like a tear . 
he be build like a shark . 
he be make to run fast and free . 
and the builder shake they hand and the builder share they wine . 
think this they have master the sea . 
yes , he 'll always run silent and he 'll always run deep though the ocean have no pity , though the wave will never weep. they 'll never weep. and they marvel at he speed and they marvel at he depth and they marvel at he deadly design . 
and they sail to every land and they sail to every port just to see what fault they can find . 
then they put he on the land for nine month to stand and they work on he from stem to stern . 
but they can never see it be they coffin to be for the sea be wait for they return . 
yes , he 'll always run silent and he 'll always run deep though the ocean have no pity , though the wave will never weep. they 'll never weep. on a cold wednesday morn they put he out to sea when the wave , they be nine foot high . 
and they dive beneath the wave and they dive to they grave and they never say a last goodbye . 
and it 's deep and deep and deep they dive just to see what they ship can stand . 
but the hull give a moan and the hull give a groan and they plunge to the deep , dark sand . 
now he lie in the depth of the darken ocean floor , cover by the water cold and still . 
oh , ca n't you see the wrong ? 
he be a death ship all along . 
die before he have a chance to kill .
