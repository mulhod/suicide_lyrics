# junk bond trader the imitation pick you up like a habit , write in the glow of the tv 's static , take out the trash to the man . 
give the people something they understand . 
a stickman flash a fine-line smile .

rich man in a poor man 's clothe . 
the permanent installment of the daily dose . 
and you tell off when you tell it like it be . 
you world 's no wide than you hatred of he . 
check into a small reality , bore as a drug you take too regularly . 
the athlete 's laugh .

the first true love this fold at the slight touch , bring down like an old hotel . 
people dig through rubble for thing they can resell . 
happy holiday , say sick savior , the leave lover this i still favor .

i do n't need a remedy to be everything i 'm suppose to be . 
i do n't want nobody else . 
i can do it by me . 
we 're mean to be together . 
now i 'm a policeman direct traffic , keep everything move , everything static . 
i 'm the hitchhiker you 'll recognize pass on you way to some everlasting .

well sell it while you can . 
well sell it while you can . 
well sell it while you can .
