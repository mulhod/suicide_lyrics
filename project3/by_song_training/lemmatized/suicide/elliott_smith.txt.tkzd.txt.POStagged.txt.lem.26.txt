#somebody this i use to know i have tender feeling this you make hard , but it 's you heart , not me , this 's scar . 
so when i go home , i 'll be happy to go . 
you 're just somebody this i use to know . 
you do n't need me help anymore . 
it 's all now to you , there be not no before , now this you 're big enough to run you own show . 
you 're just somebody this i use to know . 
i watch you deal in a dying day and throw the live past away , so you can be sure this you 're in control . 
you 're just somebody this i use to know . 
i know you do n't think you do me wrong and i ca n't stay this way for long , keep ahold of what you just let go . 
you 're just somebody this i use to know .
