#i do n't understand think you 'd be look for the next in line to love , then ignore , put out and put away . 
and so you 'd soon be leave me alone like i 'm suppose to be tonight , tomorrow , and every day . 
there 's nothing here this you 'll miss . 
i can guarantee you this be a cloud of smoke , try to occupy space . 
what a fuck joke . 
what a fuck joke . 
i wait for a bus to separate the both of we and take me off far away from you because me feeling never change a bite . 
i always feel like shit . 
i do n't know why . 
i guess this i just do . 
you once talk to me about love and you paint picture of a never-neverland and i can 've go to this place , but i do n't understand , i do n't understand , i do n't understand .
