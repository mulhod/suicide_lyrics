#everything mean nothing to me someone find the future as a statue in a fountain at attention , look backward in a pool of water , wish with a blue songbird on he shoulder who keep sing over everything . 
everything mean nothing to me . 
everything mean nothing to me . 
everything mean nothing to me . 
i pick up the song and find me picture in the paper . 
the reflection in the water show an iron man still try to salute people from a time when he be everything he 's suppose to be . 
everything mean nothing to me . 
everything mean nothing to me . 
everything mean nothing to me . 
everything mean nothing to me .
