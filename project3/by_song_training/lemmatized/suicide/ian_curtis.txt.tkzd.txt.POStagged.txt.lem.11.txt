#atmosphere walk in silence . 
do n't walk away in silence . 
see the danger , always danger . 
endless talk . 
life rebuild . 
do n't walk away . 
walk in silence . 
do n't turn away in silence . 
you confusion , me illusion , wear like a mask of self-hate , confront and then die . 
do n't walk away . 
people like you find it easy , naked to see . 
walk on air . 
hunt by the river , through the street . 
every corner abandon too soon , set down with due care . 
do n't walk away in silence . 
do n't walk away .
