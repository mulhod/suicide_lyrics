Heart of Gold

I want to live.
I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give that keep me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old, keeps me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old.
I've been to Hollywood.
I've been to Redwood.
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold.
I've been in my mind.
it's such a fine line that keeps me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old, keeps me searching for a heart of gold and I'm getting old.
keep me searching for a heart of gold.
You keep me searching for a heart of gold and I'm growing old.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.

#Old Man

Old man, look at my life I'm a lot like you were.
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were.
Old man, look at my life, twenty-four and there's so much more.
Live alone in a paradise that makes me think of two.
Love lost, such a cost, give me things that don't get lost, like a coin that won't get tossed rolling home to you.
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you.
I need someone to love me the whole day through.
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true.
Lullabies, look in your eyes, run around the same old town.
Doesn't mean that much to me to mean that much to you.
I've been first and last.
Look at how the time goes past.
But I'm all alone at last, rolling home to you.
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you.
I need someone to love me the whole day through.
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true.
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were.
Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you were.

#The Needle and the Damage Done

I caught you knocking at my cellar door.
I love you, baby.
can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done.
I hit the city and I lost my band.
I watched the needle take another man.
Gone, gone, the damage done.
I sing the song because I love the man.
I know that some of you don't understand.
Milk blood to keep from running out.
I've seen the needle and the damage done, a little part of it in everyone.
But every junkie's like a setting sun.

#Going Back

In a foreign land there were creatures at play, running hand in hand, needing nowhere to stay, driven to the mountains high, they were sunken in the cities deep, living in my sleep.
I feel like going back, back where there's nowhere to stay, when fire filled the sky.
I'll still remember that day.
These rocks I'm climbing down have already left the ground, careening through space.
I used to build these buildings.
I used to walk next to you.
Their shadows tore us apart and now we do what we do.
Driven to the mountains high, sunken in the cities deep, living in our sleep.
I feel like going back, back where there's nowhere to stay.

#Comes a Time

Comes a time when you're drifting, comes a time when you settle down.
Comes a light, feelings lifting.
Lift that baby right up off the ground.
Oh, this old world keeps spinning around.
It's a wonder tall trees ain't laying down.
There comes a time.
You and I, we were captured.
We took our souls and we flew away.
We were right, we were giving.
That's how we kept what we gave away.
Oh, this old world keeps spinning around.
It's a wonder tall trees ain't laying down.
There comes a time.

#Look Out for My Love

There's a lot to learn for wasting time.
There's a heart that burns.
There's an open mind.
Look out for my love, look out for my love, look out for my love, look out for my love.
You own it, you own it now.
You own it.
There's a weight on you, but you can't feel it.
Living like I do, it's hard for you to see it.
Was I hurt too bad?
Can I show you daylight?
How could I be sad when I know that you might?
Look out for my love, look out for my love, look out for my love, look out for my love.
Look out for my love.
It's in your neighborhood.
I know things are going to change, but I can't say bad or good.
Silver wings of morning shining in the gray day while the ice is forming on a lonely runway.
Hydraulic wipers pumping till the window glistens.
Something saying something.
No one seems to listen.
Men with walkie-talkies, men with flashlights waving.
Up upon the tower time reads daylight savings.
I'm home again to you, babe.
You know it makes me wonder, sitting in the quiet slipstream in the thunder.
Look out for my love, look out for my love, look out for my love, look out for my love.

#Unknown Legend

She used to work in a diner.
Never saw a woman look finer.
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor.
She grew up in a small town, never put her roots down.
Daddy always kept moving, so she did too.
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a Harley-Davidson, her long blonde hair flying in the wind.
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes, the air she breathes.
You know it ain't easy.
You got to hold on.
She was an unknown legend in her time.
Now she's dressing two kids, looking for a magic kiss.
She gets the far-away look in her eyes.
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a Harley-Davidson, her long blonde hair flying in the wind.
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides colliding with the very air she breathes, the air she breathes.

#From Hank to Hendrix

From Hank to Hendrix I walked these streets with you.
Here I am with this old guitar, doing what I do.
I always expected that you would see me through.
I never believed in much, but I believed in you.
Can we get it together?
Can we still stand side by side?
Can we make it last, like a musical ride?
From Marilyn to Madonna I always loved your smile.
Now we're headed for the big divorce, California-style.
I found myself singing like a long-lost friend.
The same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end.
Can we get it together?
Can we still stand side by side?
Can we make it last, like a musical ride?
Sometime it's distorted, not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringing through.
New glass in the window, new leaf on the tree, new distance between us, you and me.
Can we get it together?
Can we still walk side by side?
Can we make it last, like a musical ride?

#Harvest Moon

Come a little bit closer, hear what I have to say.
Just like children sleepinh, we could dream this night away.
But there's a full moon rising.
Let's go dancing in the light.
We know where the music's playing.
Let's go out and feel the night because I'm still in love with you.
I want to see you dance again because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon.
When we were strangers, I watched you from afar.
When we were lovers, I loved you with all my heart.
But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high.
I want to celebrate, see it shining in your eye, because I'm still in love with you.
I want to see you dance again, because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon.

#Dreaming Man

I'm a dreaming man, yes, that's my problem.
I can't tell when I'm not being real.
In the meadow dusk I park my Aerostar with a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you.
I'll always be a dreaming man.
I don't have to understand.
I know it's alright.
I see your curves and I feel your vibrations, you dressed in black and white, you lost in the mall.
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations.
Another sleepless night, a sun that won't fall.
I'll always be a dreaming man.
I don't have to understand.
I know it's alright.
Now the night is gone, a new day is dawning, and our homeless dreams go back to the street.
Another time or place, another civilization would really make this life feel so complete.
I'll always be a dreaming man.
I don't have to understand.
I know it's alright.
Dreaming man, he's got a problem.
Dreaming man, dreaming man, he's got a problem.
Dreaming man.
