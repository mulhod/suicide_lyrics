Imagine

Imagine there's no heaven.
It's easy if you try.
No hell below us, above us only sky.
Imagine all the people living for today.
Imagine there's no countries.
It isn't hard to do.
Nothing to kill or die for, and no religion too.
Imagine all the people living life in peace.
You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will be as one.
Imagine no possessions.
I wonder if you can.
No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man.
Imagine all the people sharing all the world.
You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will live as one.

#Cold Turkey

Temperature's rising, fever is high.
Can't see no future.
Can't see no sky.
My feet are so heavy, so is my head.
I wish I was a baby.
I wish I was dead.
Cold turkey has got me on the run.
Body is aching, goose pimple bone.
Can't see no body.
Leave me alone.
My eyes are wide open.
Can't get to sleep.
One thing I'm sure of, I'm at the deep freeze.
Cold turkey has got me on the run.
Cold turkey has got me on the run.
Thirty-six hours rolling in pain.
Praying to someone.
Free me again.
Oh, I'll be a good boy.
Please make me well.
I promise you anything.
Get me out of this hell.

#Love

Love is real.
Real is love.
Love is feeling, feeling love.
Love is wanting to be loved.
Love is touch.
Touch is love.
Love is reaching, reaching love.
Love is asking to be loved. 
Love is you, you and me.
Love is knowing we can be.
Love is free.
Free is love.
Love is living, living love.
Love is needing to be loved.

#Nobody Told Me 

Everybody's talking, and no one says a word.
Everybody's making love, and no one really cares.
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs.
Always something happening and nothing going on.
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot.
They're starving back in China, so finish what you got.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Strange days indeed, strange days indeed.
Everybody's running, and no one makes a move.
Everyone's a winner, and nothing left to lose.
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu.
Everybody's flying, and no one leaves the ground.
Everybody's crying, and no one makes a sound.
There's a place for us in the movies you just got to lay around.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Strange days indeed, most peculiar, mama.
Everybody's smoking, and no one's getting high.
Everybody's flying, and never touch the sky.
There's a UFO over New York, and I ain't too surprised.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Nobody told me there'd be days like these.
Strange days indeed, most peculiar, mama.

#Working Class Hero

As soon as you're born, they make you feel small by giving you no time instead of it all till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all. 
A working-class hero is something to be.
They hurt you at home, and they hit you at school.
They hate you if you're clever, and they despise a fool till you're so fucking crazy, you can't follow their rules.
A working-class hero is something to be.
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty-odd years, then they expect you to pick a career.
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear, a working class hero is something to be.
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV, and you think you're so clever and classless and free, but you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.
A working-class hero is something to be.
There's room at the top, they're telling you still, but first you must learn how to smile as you kill if you want to be like the folks on the hill.
A working-class hero is something to be.
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me.

#Crippled Inside

You can shine your shoes and wear a suit.
You can comb your hair and look quite cute.
You can hide your face behind a smile.
One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside.
You can wear a mask and paint your face.
You can call yourself the human race.
You can wear a collar and a tie.
One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside .
Well, now, you know that your cat has nine lives, nine lives to itself, but you only got one and a dog's life ain't fun.
Mama, take a look outside .
You can go to church and sing a hymn.
You can judge me by the color of my skin.
You can live a lie until you die.
One thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside .

#How Do You Sleep?

So Sergeant Pepper took you by surprise.
You better see right through that mother's eyes.
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead.
The one mistake you made was in your head.
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night? 
You live with straights who tell you you was king, jump when your mama tell you anything.
The only thing you done was yesterday and, since you're gone, you're just another day.
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night? 
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?
A pretty face may last a year or two, but pretty soon they'll see what you can do.
The sound you make is muzak to my ears.
You must have learned something in all those years.
Ah, how do you sleep?
Ah, how do you sleep at night?

#Mind Games

We're playing those mind games together, pushing the barriers, planting seeds, playing the mind guerrilla, chanting the Mantra peace on earth.
We all been playing those mind games forever, some kind of druid dudes lifting the veil, doing the mind guerrilla.
Some call it magic, the search for the grail.
Love is the answer and you know that for sure.
Love is a flower.
you got to let it grow.
So keep on playing those mind games together, faith in the future out of the now.
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas, absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind.
Yeah, we're playing those mind games together, projecting our images in space and in time.
Yes is the answer and you know that for sure.
Yes is surrender.
you got to let it go.
So keep on playing those mind games together, doing the ritual dance in the sun, millions of mind guerrillas putting their soul power to the karmic wheel.
Keep on playing those mind games together, raising the spirit of peace and love.
I want you to make love, not war.
I know you've heard it before.

#Out the Blue

Out the blue you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me .
Every day I thank the Lord and Lady for the way that you came to me.
Anyway, it had to be two minds, one destiny .
Out the blue you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me .
All my life's been a long slow knife.
I was born just to get to you.
Anyway, I survived long enough to make you my wife .
Out the blue you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me .
Like a U.F.O. you came to me and blew away life's misery, out the blue life's energy, out the blue you came to me.

#I Know (I Know)

The years have passed so quickly.
One thing I've understood: I am only learning to tell the trees from wood.
I know what's coming down and I know where it's coming from and I know and I'm sorry, yes, I am, but I never could speak my mind.
and I know just how you feel and I know now what I have done and I know and I'm guilty, but I never could speak my mind.
I know what I was missing, but now my eyes can see.
I put myself in your place as you did for me.
Today I love you more than yesterday.
Right now I love you more right now.
Now I know what's coming down.
I can feel where it's coming from and I know it's getting better all the time as we share in each other's minds.

From distant lands, one woman, one man.

Three thousand miles over the ocean, three thousand light-years from the land of the rising sun.
Love has opened up my eyes.
Love has blown right through.
Wherever you are, you are here.
Wherever you are, you are here.
Three thousand miles over the ocean, three thousand light-years from the land of the surprising sun.

#Going Down on Love

Got to get down, down on my knees.
Got to get down, down on my knees.
Going down on love.
Going down on love.
Going down, going down, going down.
When the real thing goes wrong and you can't get it on and your love, she has gone and you got to carry on and you shoot out the light, ain't coming home for the night, you know you got to, got to, got to pay the price.
Somebody please, please help me.
You know I'm drowning in the sea of hatred.
Got to get down, down on my knees.
Got to get down, down on my knees.
Going down on love.
Going down on love.
Going down, going down, going down.

Nothing doing nowhere.
Well, you burn all your boats and you sow your wild oats.
Well, you know, you know, you know the price is right!

#Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)

Sweet as the smell of success, her body's warm and wet.
She gets me through this god-awful loneliness, a natural high butterfly, Oh I, I need, need, need her.
Just like a willow tree, a breath of spring, you see, and, oh, boy, you don't know what she do to me.
She makes me sweat and forget who I am.
I need, need, need, need her .
Well, I was wondering how long this could go on, on and on.
Well, I thought I could never be surprised.
But could it be that I bit my own tongue?
Oh, yeah, it's so hard to swallow when you're wrong.
A bird of paradise, the sunrise in her eyes.
God only knows such a sweet surprise.
I was blind.
she blew my mind.
think that I, I love, love, love, love, love her.
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her .
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet love.
