Fisherman

Between the darkness and the light, as the stars fade out of sight, I can hear his shiny boots fall on the sand.
With a basket at his side, and the morning full of pride you can see him cast his line with skillful hands.
Hey, hey, fisherman, wish you luck that's all I can.
Hey, hey, fisherman, forget the world if that's your plan.
As the morning turns to noon, he's content to sit and croon, and he lights his twisted pipe and settles down.
Onward goes the time as he tries new baited line, so he digs another worm up from the ground.
Hey, hey, fisherman, wish you luck that's all I can.
Hey, hey, fisherman, forget the world if that's your plan.
Between the nightness and the light, the line is taut.
He has a bite, and he hauls the beauty in with skillful pride.
And his patient mind is blown because the fish is overgrown.
It was really worth a day for such a prize.
Hey hey, fisherman.
 
#Beautiful and Blue

She looks out of her window at the people passing by. 
They look so happy. 
Makes her cry.
She watches them laughing. 
Sees the lovers holding hands, and everyone each other's friends.
Beautiful and blue, they're not as good as you.
Beautiful and blue, they're lonely too.
She feels so unhappy.
She no longer cares for life and is close to ending all her strifes.
The world doesn't know her.
It's so hard and cold and cruel.
She wonders why she's such a fool.
Beautiful and blue.
Beautiful and blue.

#Angelique

Angelique, your name is whispered by the passing breeze.
Proclaims your beauty to the tallest trees.
And you're mine, Angelique.
Angelique, you stand alone because none compares with you.
So far from those who try to be with you.
And you're mine, Angelique.
Angelique, your kiss is only like the morning dew.
You smile, the whole wide world, it smiles with you.
And you're mine, Angelique.
And you're mine, Angelique.
I'll never be with you,  never ever touch your hand.
So I'll just dream of you, lonely in my wonder land.
Angelique, when will I ever meet a girl like you?
And if I do, how will I know it's true, that you're mine, Angelique?
 
#Maybe Tomorrow

Listen to a lonely sound. 
See the grey and sadness all around.
See the people go their way. 
Care not of me and the love I've lost today.
Maybe tomorrow I will love again.
I'll never know until I've looked into her eyes.
Maybe tomorrow I will love again.
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice.
And so I'm living for a dream. 
Each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine.
I'll make believe that I don't care. 
I'll tell my friends I love my life.
I'm happy.
Maybe tomorrow I will love again.
I'll never know until I've looked into her eyes.
Maybe tomorrow I will love again.
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice.
Wherever, whoever you may be, let the light of your love shine through the window of my heart.
Then when you've colored all my thoughts bright, don't let me ever ever think of night, no yeah!
Maybe tomorrow you will love again.
I'll never know until I've looked into her eyes.
Maybe tomorrow you will love again.
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice.
Maybe tomorrow you will love again.

#Money 

Money stole my lady.
Fools have a way of making me lazy.
Money buy you freedom.
Rules have a way of making me crazy.
So we grow a little older with another tale to tell.
So we grow a little colder with another tale to tell.
Money make you feel unhappy.
Fools have a way of making me crazy.
So we grow a little older with another tale to tell.
So we grow a little colder with another tale to tell.

#It's Over

Pack my bag. 
I'm going away.
It's over.
Going home.
Thank you, people, but it's too much to stay.
It's done now.
I'm going home.
Now I feel like I'm warm.
Now I feel like I'm tuned.
Spent my time and some fun, and for that I thank you.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over. 
I'm going home.
It's over.
It's over, and for that I thank you.
Now I feel like I'm warm.
Now I feel like I'm tuned.
Spent my time and some fun, and for that I thank you.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over. 
I'm going home.
It's over.
It's over, and for that I thank you.
 
#No Good at All

Don't let your mother see you rock.
Don't let your mother see you roll.
Don't let your mother hear you knocking.
Don't let your mother see you go.
Don't ever let her see you out of your head.
Do you no good at all.
Don't let your brother put you down.
Don't let your brother put you on.
Don't let your brother hear your barking.
Don't let your brother see you go.
Don't ever let him see you out of your head.
Do you no good at all.

#Sing for the Song

Words won't come together, and they're very hard to me.
Peace of mind is all I have to win.
Tuning doesn't matter just as long as I can sing.
Get myself together for the song, and we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
Yes, we'll all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
Now, I get to feeling that it may be just a dream.
May be just another foolish game.
As long as we all sing it when we have no time to think.
Have no time for bringing down our friends.
And we can all sing, sing for the song.
Yes, we'll all bring, bring it along.
Yes, we'll all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.
And we can all sing, sing for the song, and we'll all bring, bring it along.

#Blind Owl 

Lies, ties, Mr. Cool disguise.
Hang it up.
Get up on your own.
Pill-driven skills, weeping Whip-poor-wills.
Too much going around that you can't hide.
Look out for the blind owl.
You can only find that you were wrong.
No one else around me ever loved me like you do, so I'll be strong.
Look out for the blind owl.
You can only find that you were wrong.
No one else around me ever loved me like you do, so I'll be strong.
Days, plays, interviewer's maze.
Play the role.
Sell your soul.
Becoming to yourself, a hero who must never lie.
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?
Who must never lie?

#When I Say 

What you are is what I see.
What I see is what I want it to be.
When I say I love you, what I mean is I really do.
I'm not the one who'll give you everything you need, but what I mean is that I'll try.
I can't deny that I've been burning inside for all the things I'll never see.
So come on, be yourself, nothing else.
Who could ask for any more?
And you know, they all love you.
What is more, I really do.
I'm not the one who'll give you everything you need, but what I mean is that I'll try.
I can't deny that I've been burning inside for all the things I'll never see.

#Where Do We Go From Here

Someone gives you their heart, but you still throw it all away, knowing the past is a part, part of what you are today.
We all know you had your troubles.
We all know you had your days.
What is love?
You can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride, telling yourself you're a loser like someone winning who's not, telling yourself you're a loser.
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Someone showed you the way that you'll be ready to see that the game had been played.
Losers had lost, and the winners were free.
We all know you have your troubles.
We all know you have your ways.
What is love?
You can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride, telling yourself you're a loser like someone winning who's not, telling yourself you're a loser.
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
We all know you have your troubles.
We all know you have your days.
What is love?
You can throw it all away with the helplessness of your pride, telling yourself you're a loser like someone winning who's not, telling yourself you're a loser.
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?

#King of the Load 

He's the king of the road, the old man, the child.
The joker running wild, making it funny.
He's of no fixed abode .
When he carries the load, he'll do anything he can to make it funny.
But he'll never say die if he's living a lie.
Pick up his hat and go. 
If there's reason to cry, he'll just make it a sigh, and wander on down the road.
He's a natural friend with the money to lend, or whatever it takes to turn you on, too. 
He's the father, the son. 
He don't owe anyone. 
All his debts are all paid with his confection.
Then he'll wander away with no time in his way.
Pick up his hat and go. 
He'll never say die if he's living a lie. 
Just wander on down the road, wander on down the road. 
And he'll wander away with no time in his way.
Pick up his hat and go. 
He never said die. 
He was living a lie. 
Just wandered on down the road, wandered on down the road, wandered on down the road.

#Look Out California 

Bags are packed.
Jumping on a jet today.

#Lost Inside Your Love

What can I say?
What can I do?
All of my life I've been a victim of you.
What can I say or do?
Lost inside your love.
What can it be?
Who can I see?
All of your life you've been the winner in me.
What can I say or do?
Lost inside your love.
Is it any wonder, there's no reason why?
Is it all because I left it open wide for your pride, to leave me one more time?
Are you leaving me one more time?
What can I say?
What can I do?
All of my life I've been a winner with you.
What can I say or do?
Lost inside your love.
Lost inside your love.
Lost inside your love.
