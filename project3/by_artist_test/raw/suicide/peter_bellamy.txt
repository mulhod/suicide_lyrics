The Ballad of Henry & Susannah, Pt. 1

Come all you gentle people and listen to my tale, concerning a poor convict.
From Suffolk he did hail.
For fourteen years transported, as you shall understand for to lead a poor and wretched life upon Van Diemen's Land.
Young Henry Cabell was his name, and in Mendham he did dwell.
His poor but honest parents, they reared him right well till cruel hardship overcame them and his father in despair to feed his family did embark upon a wild career. 

#Us Poor Fellows

The times they are hard and the wages are poor.
None of us poor fellows has money in store.
So how can a good man keep the wolf from the door?
Poor fellows, we all will go down.
When work it is scarce, tell me, how can we eat?
How can we afford to buy shoes for our feet?
And how can we get clothing to keep off the sleet?
Poor fellows, we might as well drown.
If we could find labor we never would complain.
We'd work well for a master, his favour to gain.
We'd be honest and faithful with never a stain.
But, poor fellows, how will we survive?
We could plough the good land.
We could fish the salt sea.
We could work in the woodland felling of trees.
But when only the breath of our bodies is free, poor fellows, can we stay alive?
Now a man that is single, he's free of all care.
He can soon leave a district if no work be there.
There's no manner of hardship that he cannot bear.
Poor fellows, if he is alone.
But a man with a family, his hands they are tied.
He must look to their comfort or lose all his pride.
He can't wander away but must stay by their side, poor fellows, and maintain his home.
Oh a man that is willing can't understand why he can find no employment, how hard he may try.
And it break his poor heart for to see his wife cry, so poor fellow, he'll do what he can.
And a man that is desperate and can't find a job, he will not be contended to sit home and sob.
Be he ever so honest, he'll turn out and rob, poor fellow, to prove he's a man.
If a good man goes robbing, you know it's a shame.
He brings scorn and misfortune on his honest name.
But it pitiful straits, tell me, who is to blame?
Poor fellow, you know he must try.
So let's hope that these hard times they soon pass away.
All unto our sweet saviour we earnestly pray that this dark, cloudy morn brings a glorious day.
Poor fellows, sometime ere we die. 

#The Robber's Song

My name is Abe Carman.
My trade it is right charming, for you know there is no harm in a little burglary.
I live by taking chances, like the heroes of Romances, and taking what I fancies with bold audacity!
There's wealth all for the taking, and there is no mistaking, my fortune I am making with a little robbery.
No man shall be my master as long as I run faster than those that would me blast for taking things for free!
I've robbed the great and wealthy in manner sly and stealthy, but it's just to keep me healthy as you can plainly see.
No watch, no ring, no clock it is not safe within your pocket, and it will avail you naught to lock it from light-fingered gentry! 

#The Ballad of Henry & Susannah, Pt. 2

So his father with a band went out when all lay sound asleep into a house in Alburgh town those desperate men did creep.
Young Henry he went with them, having reached his nineteenth year.
His part it was to stand a watch and see the coast was clear.
But fortune was not with that band, kind favor passed them by, for the constables they soon did come and did raise the hue and cry.
They was quickly overtaken and carried to the jail for to wring their hands and curse their fate until their strength did fail.
It was at Thetford assizes at the bar they soon did stand, and the sentence it was given that all three of them should hang.
But up spoke Henry's mother, crying, "Spare my only son, for his years are few, and for one crime his race should not be run."
Fourteen years of transportation became Henry's punishment, and to the cells of Norwich Castle this young man was sent.
Leaving his tender mother for to tear her hair in woe as her husband and Abe Carman to the gallows-tree did go. 

#The Leaves in the Woodland 

Oh the grass in the meadow, the reeds by the mere, the sad boom of the bittern is all that I hear.
And the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry: You never shall sit by your loved ones no more. 
When I was a young girl the world did seem gay, but these cruel hard times do drive comfort away.
And the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry: You never shall dance with your sweetheart no more.
Once I gathered wild flowers in the sweet countryside, but my garlands have withered. 
My posies have died.
And the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry: You never shall lie by your husband no more.
Once I went a-courting, but now my man's gone.
Once I was a mother, but now I'm alone.
And the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry: You never shall walk with your menfolk no more. 
Come all you young women that's free from all care.
Don't you ever get married, all sorrows lies there.
For the leaves in the woodland and the gulls by the shore cry: The heart that is given no man may restore. 
Now the fields are all empty.
The hedgerows are bare.
Only wild desolation is all I find there.
I'll go down to the river to ease all my pain, and who knows, but I might find my dear ones again.

#The Ballad of Henry & Susannah, Pt. 3

He had not been in Norwich Jail nine months unto a year when a pretty Norfolk serving maid, she also was sent there.
For stealing silver teaspoons, she from Thurlton village came for fourteen years of transport far across the raging main.

#I Once Lived in Service 

I once lived in service to a lady so fine.
I've served her by night and by day.
I've carried the dishes when the lady would dine, and after, I cleared them away.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is all slavery.
I've made up her bed, and I turned down her sheets.
I ironed the dresses she wore.
I've peeled her potatoes.
I've roasted her meats.
And it was I, with my broom, swept her floor.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is all misery.
I scrubbed her front doorstep.
I polished her plate.
I put coals in the pan for her bed.
I've rose before sunlight to blacklead her grate, and at midnight I've laid down my head.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is all drudgery.
I've carried her water.
I've answered her door.
I've polished the shoes for her feet.
And when she went to church, then her prayer-book I bore behind as she marched down the street.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant's a penance to me.
Now, I met a young man in the village one day as I run to the shop for her bread.
He's asked me my name, but I had to away lest me mistress should break me poor head.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant has no liberty.
So that night as I lay in my attic so bare, I resolved that I would run away.
And all for to honor the waggoner's fare, some silver spoons took for me pay.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant is melancholy.
Now I lie in prison but I will not weep.
Who knows what tomorrow may hold?
There's some fine lads in here for my company to keep.
There's strong arms to keep me from cold.
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a convict is all chivalry!
Now I've known confinement the most of me years.
Small freedom did I ever know.
Some prisons, sure, they have no cold iron bars, but some prisons, why, they have no men!
Oh dear me, how can it be?
The life of a convict's a pleasure to me.
Dear me, how can it be?
The life of a servant was never so free!

#Norwich Jail 

So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale, we wonder if we'll ever see the last of Norwich Jail.
The food is foul.
The air is bad.
The company not choice.
It would make you scowl to hear that mad old turnkey's rasping voice.
It would make you wonder would you ever live to tell the tale Of the hardships and the miseries you've known in Norwich Jail.
Our water here is scummy-green.
Our beds is heaps of straw.
There's water running down the walls, rats running over the floor.
There's naught to eat but rotten meat that'd make a dog turn pale.
Oh, it's dainty board and lodging when you visit Norwich Jail!
So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale, we wonder if we'll ever see the last of Norwich Jail.
Whene'er we fancy bathing, we paddles in the drains.
And when we wants a concert, we rattles of our chains.
And when we want a banquet we drink sludge and call it ale.
If you want a good time, commit a crime and come to Norwich Jail!
Now if you fancy gaming here, the race is run by fleas.
The stakes are perilously high: a crust of moldy cheese.
The first time that I tried my luck, I nearly lost my shirt.
But lucky for me they couldn't see the bugger for the dirt.
So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale, we wonder if we'll ever see the last of Norwich Jail.
If they'd sent us to America, today we would be free.
But since the Revolution that land we'll never see.
We are not for New England's shores, three thousand miles away.
They say we're bound for some further ground and they've named it Botany Bay.
Well perhaps it's out by India, or maybe near Japan.
Just off the coast of Canada or in the hills of Spain.
But wherever that strange land may be we know it cannot fail to be a far, far better place than stinking Norwich Jail.
So early in the morning the turnkey rings his bell.
So early in the morning we wish his soul to Hell.
So early in the morning when the night begins to pale we long for the day when we'll sail away from stinking Norwich Jail.

#Sweet Loving Friendship

If you look out from some high, high window, You will see the sun set beyond the town.
You will see the rooks to the tree-tops screaming, and the wing of evening come folding down.
Between the morning and the evening, between the Springtime and the Winter drear, there comes a time of new beginnings, when sweet loving friendship drives away all fear.
There is many here they know naught but sorrow, and like the beasts they live from day to day.
But we can think on a bright tomorrow since sweet loving friendship drives all grief away.
All hope in prison, it soon will smother if none will with you your sorrow share.
But we cling fast to one each other and sweet loving friendship banishes despair.
Just like the sailor when his ship makes harbor, just like the traveller who finds an inn, what care they if the wind blows harder when they be safe and warm within?
No lonely convict can resist the darkness, just as no sailor can the driving rain.
But find a comrade for to share your fastness and sweet loving friendship will ease your pain.
So if you look out from some high, high window, and see the sun set beyond the sky.
You need not mourn at the coming shadow if some loving friend is standing nigh.

#The Ballad Of Henry and Susannah, Pt. 4 

For three long years and upward in that dark and bitter cell young Henry and Susannah they lovingly did dwell.
And in Seventeen and eighty six, she bore him a baby boy.
Who would believe that such a pit could ever hold such joy?
But sorrow quickly followed which did pierce them to the heart for the news was to them carried that their family must part.
Young Henry was to stay in jail, as he did understand, while Susannah she was to be sent to far Van Diemen's Land.
Down on his knees he pleaded, all from his breaking heart, that from his own dear loved ones he would not be forced to part.
But in that dreary dungeon young Henry had to stay as his sweetheart and his little son to Plymouth were conveyed.

#The Black and Bitter Night

It is cold, sad, and lonely in this dismal cell.
No solace comes up with the day.
My heart knows an anguish that no tongue can tell since they've taken my true love away.
Oh, the black and bitter night, and oh, the weary day.
My love has been snatched far, far from my sight, and the transports will bear her away.
When first in this prison so deep was my pain.
Then she came and she banished dismay.
But now in despondence I'm drowning again, for they've taken my true love away.
Though surrounded by horrors, yet we found delight, for where love is, no sorrow can stay.
But misery and squalor swim back to my sight now they've taken my true love away
Why, the grasses still grow, and the streams still down flow, and the blackbird still sings on the spray.
But in dank, deary dungeons there's nothing but woe since they've taken my true love away.
Well, if I were a seagull, I'd fly to her side, and it's there that I wish I could stay.
But soon the cruel prison ships leave with the tide and they've bearing my true love away.
If I were a herring, I'd wait by the slip, though I waited a year and a day.
Then through the wide ocean I'd follow the ship that is bearing my true love away
So lovers, cling fast to each pleasure you find and cherish each moment of play, for all you will have is what stays in your mind once they've taken your true love away.

#The Humane Turnkey (1)

"Come rise you up, John Simpson," the governor did say.
"These scum are chained and ready, and it's time you was away.
Three woman and a farthing child, to Plymouth they are bound,
And you must be their escort till they reach that distant town."
When me and these poor convicts did arrive at Plymouth strand, I marched them up onto the deck all chained hand to hand.
The captain saw us come aboard and he did prove unkind.
"The women come," he did declare, "But the infant stays behind."
This proud unfeeling seaman, Captain Gilbert was his name.
Oh, to see a babe abandoned so, I swore it was a shame.
I wrapped it up in my great-coat, to the coach I went straightway and I started out for London Town without no more delay. 

#The Plymouth Mail

The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
When I was a lad I used to play by the roadside all the live-long day, hoping always to espy the gentry's coaches rolling by.
When I was a youth I used to roam with a waggoner from town to town, but I longed to fly across the land on a stagecoach high with a four-in-hand.
Now I am grown unto a man on the driver's box I take my stand.
Like the captain bold of a ship of sail, I'm the man who drives the Plymouth Mail.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
With six on top and four inside, the post-poy and the guard beside, their bags and baggage safely stowed, it's time to take the open road.
Then the hooves do fly, and the wheels spin round and we bid adieu to Plymouth town.
Plympton, Brent, and Ashburton pass, and to Exeter we comes at last.
Then the horses blow, and their sides do steam, as the ostlers run to change the team.
The travellers gulp a glass of ale then back they scramble on the Plymouth Mail.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
We roll across the Dorset Downs and stage again in Shaftesbury town.
Then I crack my whip with might and main, and on we roll to Salisbury Plain.  
Soon over Hounslow Heath we fly where the gibbets loom against the sky.
And the passengers all hide their gold for fear we meet some robbers bold.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
At the sign of the Standard in Cornhill, at last my rumbling wheels are still.
And the passengers all stiff and sore thank God their journey's safely over.
In a cozy parlor now I stand with a goodly bumper to my hand, and the travellers drink a glass of ale to the health of the driver of the Plymouth Mail.
The whip goes crack, and the horn does blow.
The turnpike calls, and I must go.
And wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the Plymouth Mail.

#The Humane Turnkey (2)

Now when I came to London, having rode two hundred mile, to see a turnkey nurse a babe, it cause the crowd to smile.
But hearing its sad history, it made the crowd to groan, and many a worthy citizen swore justice would be done.
Then up and spoke a gentleman and loudly did declare that only one man in the land could settle the affair.
So to Lord Sydney's house I went, the crowd did follow on, for they swore they would see Charity before the day was done.
When we came to Lord Sydney's house, it was the hour of nine.
We all came bursting in on him as he sat down to dine.
He listened to my story, and his countenance was grave, then declared that ere the week was out, the family would be saved.
Lord Sydney wrote two letters and he signed them with his hand, one to Plymouth, one to Norwich, bidding them to understand that young Cabell and the baby with Susannah were to go as a united family unto that distant shore.
Now I'm home again in Norwich but some other trade I'll seek as a coachman or a waggoner, a shopman or a sweep.
Perhaps I'll take the shilling or go wear the jacket blue.
There's no trade but it's the kinder, so locks and bars, adieu!

#The Green Fields of England

Farewell to our lovers and our kind relations.
Farewell to the homes we love well.
There is never an ending to our tribulations, for they've damned us like sinners to Hell.
Here's adieu, here's adieu to the green fields of England.
Now we're parting from you.
The sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives.
And on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives.
From Devon, from Derby, from Wiltshire and Wales, from Norwich, from Newark and Frome, we are herded together from verminous jails and like vermin are forced from our homes.
Here's adieu, here's adieu to the green fields of England.
Now we're parting from you.
The sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives.
And on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives.
There's cheats and cut-purses and rogues with no name.
There's swindlers and sheep-stealers bold.
There's poor poaching fellows took nothing but game, and there's footpads took nothing but gold!
Here's adieu, here's adieu to the green fields of England.
Now we're parting from you.
The sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives.
And on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives.
There's coiners and clippers and ladies of pleasure.
There's dicers and drunkards and whores.
There's butchers and bakers who dealt in short measures, and a few who have broken no laws.
Here's adieu, here's adieu to the green fields of England.
Now we're parting from you.
The sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives.
And on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives.
There's some who expected to go to the scaffold.
There's others who thought to go free.
But now one and all in the hulks lie shackled, and together must plough the salt sea.
Here's adieu, here's adieu to the green fields of England.
Now we're parting from you.
The sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives.
And on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives.
There's some of our number are handsome and hearty.
There's others the voyage will mend.
But there's never a soul of our miserable party will live to see England again.
Here's adieu, here's adieu to the green fields of England.
Now we're parting from you.
The sweet fetters of love they are wrenching asunder as they tear us from sweethearts and wives.
And on some foreign shore we are sentenced to wander in exile the rest of our lives.
So farewell to all judges so kind and forgiving.
Farewell to your prisons and cells.
For though me must leave all that makes life worth living, we are leaving you bastards as well!

#Roll Down

Sweet ladies of Plymouth, we're saying goodbye.
Roll down!
But we'll rock you and roll you again by and by.
Walk her round, my brave boys and roll down!
And we will roll down!
Walk her round, my brave boys and roll down!
Now the anchor's aweigh and the sails are unfurled, and we're bound for to take her half-way round the world.
In the wide Bay of Biscay the seas will run high, and the poor sickly transports they'll wish they could die.
When the wild coast of Africa it do appear, the poor nervous transports they'll tremble with fear.
When the Cape of Good Hope it is rounded at last, the poor lonesome transports they'll long for the past.
When the great southern whales on our quarter do spout, the poor simple transports they'll goggle and shout.
And when we arrive off Australia's strand, the poor weary transports they'll long for the land.
And when we set sail for old England's shore, the poor stranded transports we'll see them no more.
Then sweet ladies of Plymouth we'll pay all your rent, and go roving no more till our money's all spent.

#The Still and Silent Ocean

Across the still and the silent ocean our ship she finds her way alone.
The crew they make no loud commotion.
The chained transports they make no moan.
All black despair do lie behind us, and what awaits us no man may know.
Of those dark days naught can remind us.
New worlds are waiting to which we go.
Are we in chains? 
We do not feel them.
Are we ill-quartered? 
We don't complain.
Do we have guards? 
We do not see them.
Do we have sickness? 
We fell no pain.
For the night is passed.
New days are dawning.
Winter is over, and Spring draws nigh.
What's done is done.
There's no time for mourning.
What's lost is lost, and there's no time to sigh.
God bless those tender-hearted creatures who brought us back to our own again.
Good health to all whose kind deeds did reach us.
Good luck to them who did ease our pain.
Glad fortune come to Mrs. Jackson, to bold John Simpson and Lord Sydney too.
Almighty God, do spare and keep them, and grant them peace when their days are through.
Come all you poor benighted convicts.
Come join us in our present joy.
Come all you seamen who sail the tropics.
Rejoice with us that our goal is nigh.
When we're ashore the priest will wed us, as soon as we do reach the strand.
Salute the captain who here has led us to the hopeful pastures of Van Diemen's Land!

#The Ballad of Henry and Susannah, Pt. 5 

It was in the month of January Australia's coast drew near, and in that fair clime the sun did shine which filled their hearts with cheer.
And soon in peaceful Sydney Cove at anchor they did ride and admired the green and pleasant shore beyond the foaming tide.
Then up spoke Captain Philip, for so richly dressed was he: "Some man must bear me through the surf and keep me from the sea!"
Then up stepped Henry Cabell, being one both stout and tall, saying, "Captain, I will be that man and will not let you fall."
And so they sat them in the jolly boat, and the crew did pull for land.
And when they reached the shallows, Henry o'er the gunwale sprang.
He took the captain up on his back and he waded to the sand.
The very first of exiles in that distant part to stand.
And a fortnight later Henry took Susannah for his wife, the comfort of his darkest days to comfort him through life.
And when their years of sentence passed, their happiness did grow with property, prosperity and children also.
And so come all you gentle people who are lost in dark dismay, and remember that the blackest night must some time yield to day.
Remember that the wildest storm eventually must pass and, like Henry and Susannah, may you find your joy at last.
