fisherman between the darkness and the light , as the star fade out of sight , i can hear he shiny boot fall on the sand . 
with a basket at he side , and the morning full of pride you can see he cast he line with skillful hand . 
hey , hey , fisherman , wish you luck this 's all i can . 
hey , hey , fisherman , forget the world if this 's you plan . 
as the morning turn to noon , he 's content to sit and croon , and he light he twist pipe and settle down . 
onward go the time as he try new bait line , so he dig another worm up from the grind . 
hey , hey , fisherman , wish you luck this 's all i can . 
hey , hey , fisherman , forget the world if this 's you plan . 
between the nightness and the light , the line be taut .

and he patient mind be blow because the fish be overgrow . 
it be really worth a day for such a prize .
