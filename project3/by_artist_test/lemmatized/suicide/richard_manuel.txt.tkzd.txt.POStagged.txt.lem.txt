in a station once i walk through the hall of a station . 
someone call you name . 
in the street i hear child laugh . 
they all sound the same . 
wonder , can you ever know me , know the reason why i live ? 
be there nothing you can show me ? 
life seem so little to give . 
once i climb up the face of a mountain and eat the wild fruit there , fall asleep until the moonlight wake me and i can taste you hair . 
be n't everybody dream ? 
then the voice i hear be real . 
out of all the idle scheme , ca n't we have something to feel ? 
once upon a time they use me indeed . 
tomorrow never come . 
i can sing the sound of you laughter . 
still i do n't know you name . 
must be some way to repay you out of all the good you give . 
if a rumour should delay you , love seem so little to say . 
# we can talk we can talk about it now . 
it 's this same old riddle only start from the middle . 
i 'd fix it , but i do n't know how . 
well , we can try to reason , but you may think it 's treason . 
one voice for all , echo along the hall . 
do n't give up on father clock . 
we can talk about it now . 
come , let me show you how to keep the wheel turn . 
you 've get to keep the engine churn . 
but do you ever milk a cow ? 
i have the chance one day , but i be all dress up for sunday . 
everybody , everywhere , do you really care ? 
well , then , pick up you head and walk . 
we can talk about it now . 
it seem to me we 've be hold something underneath we tongue . 
i 'm afraid if you ever get a pat on the back , it will likely burst you lung . 
stop me if i should sound kind of down in the mouth , but i 'd rather be burn in canada than to freeze here in the south . 
move this eternal plough . 
we 've get to find a sharp blade or have a new one make . 
rest awhile and cool you brow . 
do n't you see there 's no need to slave , the whip be in the grave . 
no , no trance . 
it 's safe now to take a backward glance because the flame have turn to chalk . 
we can talk about it now . 
#lonesome suzie lonesome suzie never get the break . 
he 's always lose and so he sit and cry and shake . 
it 's hard just to watch he and , if i touch he , oh , poor suzie , i 'm wonder what to do . 
he just sit there hope for a friend . 
i do n't fit here , but i may have a friend to lend . 
maybe i mistake he , but i ca n't overlook he .

anyone who 's feel this bad can tell me what to say . 
even if he just get mad he may be well off this way . 
and where be all the understand ? 
he problem ca n't be this demand . 
why be it he look me way every time he start to cry ? 
lonesome suzie , i ca n't watch you cry no long , if you can use me until you feel a little strong .

why do n't we get together ? 
what else can we do ?
