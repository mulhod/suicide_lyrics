#us poor fellow the time they be hard and the wage be poor . 
none of we poor fellow have money in store . 
so how can a good man keep the wolf from the door ? 
poor fellow , we all will go down . 
when work it be scarce , tell me , how can we eat ? 
how can we afford to buy shoe for we foot ? 
and how can we get clothe to keep off the sleet ? 
poor fellow , we may as well drown . 
if we can find labor we never will complain . 
we 'd work well for a master , he favour to gain . 
we 'd be honest and faithful with never a stain . 
but , poor fellow , how will we survive ? 
we can plough the good land . 
we can fish the salt sea . 
we can work in the woodland fell of tree . 
but when only the breath of we body be free , poor fellow , can we stay alive ? 
now a man this be single , he 's free of all care . 
he can soon leave a district if no work be there . 
there 's no manner of hardship this he can bear . 
poor fellow , if he be alone . 
but a man with a family , he hand they be tie . 
he must look to they comfort or lose all he pride . 
he ca n't wander away but must stay by they side , poor fellow , and maintain he home . 
oh a man this be will ca n't understand why he can find no employment , how hard he may try . 
and it break he poor heart for to see he wife cry , so poor fellow , he 'll do what he can . 
and a man this be desperate and ca n't find a job , he will not be contend to sit home and sob . 
be he ever so honest , he 'll turn out and rob , poor fellow , to prove he 's a man . 
if a good man go rob , you know it 's a shame . 
he bring scorn and misfortune on he honest name . 
but it pitiful strait , tell me , who be to blame ? 
poor fellow , you know he must try . 
so let 's hope this this hard time they soon pass away . 
all unto we sweet saviour we earnestly pray this this dark , cloudy morn bring a glorious day . 
poor fellow , sometime ere we die .

#norwich jail so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail . 
the food be foul . 
the air be bad . 
the company not choice . 
it will make you scowl to hear this mad old turnkey 's rasp voice . 
it will make you wonder will you ever live to tell the tale of the hardship and the misery you 've know in norwich jail . 
we water here be scummy-green . 
we bed be heap of straw . 
there 's water run down the wall , rat run over the floor . 
there 's naught to eat but rotten meat this 'd make a dog turn pale . 
oh , it 's dainty board and lodge when you visit norwich jail ! 
so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail . 
whene 'er we fancy bath , we paddle in the drain . 
and when we want a concert , we rattle of we chain . 
and when we want a banquet we drink sludge and call it ale . 
if you want a good time , commit a crime and come to norwich jail ! 
now if you fancy game here , the race be run by flea . 
the stake be perilously high : a crust of moldy cheese . 
the first time this i try me luck , i nearly lose me shirt . 
but lucky for me they can n't see the bugger for the dirt . 
so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale , we wonder if we 'll ever see the last of norwich jail . 
if they 'd send we to america , today we will be free . 
but since the revolution this land we 'll never see . 
we be not for new england 's shore , three thousand mile away . 
they say we 're bind for some further grind and they 've name it botany bay . 
well perhaps it 's out by india , or maybe near japan . 
just off the coast of canada or in the hill of spain . 
but wherever this strange land may be we know it can fail to be a far , far well place than stink norwich jail . 
so early in the morning the turnkey ring he bell . 
so early in the morning we wish he soul to hell . 
so early in the morning when the night begin to pale we long for the day when we 'll sail away from stink norwich jail . 
#sweet love friendship if you look out from some high , high window , you will see the sun set beyond the town . 
you will see the rook to the tree-tops scream , and the wing of even come fold down . 
between the morning and the even , between the springtime and the winter drear , there come a time of new beginning , when sweet love friendship drive away all fear . 
there be many here they know naught but sorrow , and like the beast they live from day to day . 
but we can think on a bright tomorrow since sweet love friendship drive all grief away . 
all hope in prison , it soon will smother if none will with you you sorrow share . 
but we cling fast to one each other and sweet love friendship banish despair . 
just like the sailor when he ship make harbor , just like the traveller who find an inn , what care they if the wind blow hard when they be safe and warm within ? 
no lonely convict can resist the darkness , just as no sailor can the drive rain . 
but find a comrade for to share you fastness and sweet love friendship will ease you pain . 
so if you look out from some high , high window , and see the sun set beyond the sky . 
you need not mourn at the come shadow if some love friend be stand nigh .

4th for three long year and upward in this dark and bitter cell young henry and susannah they lovingly do dwell .

who will believe this such a pit can ever hold such joy ? 
but sorrow quickly follow which do pierce they to the heart for the news be to they carry this they family must part . 
young henry be to stay in jail , as he do understand , while susannah he be to be send to far van diemen 's land . 
down on he knee he plead , all from he break heart , this from he own dear love one he will not be force to part . 
but in this dreary dungeon young henry have to stay as he sweetheart and he little son to plymouth be convey . 
# the black and bitter night it be cold , sad , and lonely in this dismal cell . 
no solace come up with the day . 
me heart know an anguish this no tongue can tell since they 've take me true love away . 
oh , the black and bitter night , and oh , the weary day . 
me love have be snatch far , far from me sight , and the transport will bear he away . 
when first in this prison so deep be me pain . 
then he come and he banish dismay . 
but now in despondence i 'm drown again , for they 've take me true love away . 
though surround by horror , yet we find delight , for where love be , no sorrow can stay . 
but misery and squalor swim back to me sight now they 've take me true love away why , the grass still grow , and the stream still down flow , and the blackbird still sing on the spray . 
but in dank , deary dungeon there 's nothing but woe since they 've take me true love away . 
well , if i be a seagull , i 'd fly to he side , and it 's there this i wish i can stay . 
but soon the cruel prison ship leave with the tide and they 've bear me true love away . 
if i be a herring , i 'd wait by the slip , though i wait a year and a day . 
then through the wide ocean i 'd follow the ship this be bear me true love away so lover , cling fast to each pleasure you find and cherish each moment of play , for all you will have be what stay in you mind once they 've take you true love away . 
# the humane turnkey ( 1st ) " come rise you up , john simpson , " the governor do say . 
" this scum be chain and ready , and it 's time you be away . 
three woman and a farthing child , to plymouth they be bind , and you must be they escort till they reach this distant town . 
" when me and this poor convict do arrive at plymouth strand , i march they up onto the deck all chain hand to hand . 
the captain see we come aboard and he do prove unkind . 
" the woman come , " he do declare , " but the infant stay behind . 
" this proud unfeeling seaman , captain gilbert be he name . 
oh , to see a babe abandon so , i swear it be a shame . 
i wrap it up in me great-coat , to the coach i wend straightway and i start out for london town without no more delay . 
# the plymouth mail the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
when i be a lad i use to play by the roadside all the live-long day , hope always to espy the gentry 's coach roll by . 
when i be a youth i use to roam with a waggoner from town to town , but i long to fly across the land on a stagecoach high with a four-in-hand . 
now i be grow unto a man on the driver 's box i take me stand . 
like the captain bold of a ship of sail , i 'm the man who drive the plymouth mail . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
with six on top and four inside , the post-poy and the guard beside , they bag and baggage safely stow , it 's time to take the open road . 
then the hooves do fly , and the wheel spin round and we bid adieu to plymouth town . 
plympton , brent , and ashburton pass , and to exeter we come at last . 
then the horse blow , and they side do steam , as the ostler run to change the team . 
the traveller gulp a glass of ale then back they scramble on the plymouth mail . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
we roll across the dorset down and stage again in shaftesbury town . 
then i crack me whip with may and main , and on we roll to salisbury plain . 
soon over hounslow heath we fly where the gibbet loom against the sky . 
and the passenger all hide they gold for fear we meet some robber bold . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
at the sign of the standard in cornhill , at last me rumble wheel be still . 
and the passenger all stiff and sore thank god they journey 's safely over . 
in a cozy parlor now i stand with a goodly bumper to me hand , and the traveller drink a glass of ale to the health of the driver of the plymouth mail . 
the whip go crack , and the horn do blow . 
the turnpike call , and i must go . 
and wind nor sleet nor rain nor hail will halt the driver of the plymouth mail . 
# the humane turnkey ( 2nd ) now when i come to london , have ride two hundred mile , to see a turnkey nurse a babe , it cause the crowd to smile . 
but hear it sad history , it make the crowd to groan , and many a worthy citizen swear justice will be do . 
then up and speak a gentleman and loudly do declare this only one man in the land can settle the affair . 
so to lord sydney 's house i wend , the crowd do follow on , for they swear they will see charity before the day be do . 
when we come to lord sydney 's house , it be the hour of nine . 
we all come burst in on he as he sit down to dine . 
he listen to me story , and he countenance be grave , then declare this ere the week be out , the family will be save . 
lord sydney write two letter and he sign they with he hand , one to plymouth , one to norwich , bid they to understand this young cabell and the baby with susannah be to go as a unite family unto this distant shear . 
now i 'm home again in norwich but some other trade i 'll seek as a coachman or a waggoner , a shopman or a sweep . 
perhaps i 'll take the shill or go wear the jacket blue . 
there 's no trade but it 's the kind , so lock and bar , adieu !

and soon in peaceful sydney cove at anchor they do ride and admire the green and pleasant shear beyond the foam tide . 
then up speak captain philip , for so richly dress be he : " some man must bear me through the surf and keep me from the sea ! 
" then up step henry cabell , be one both stout and tall , say , " captain , i will be this man and will not let you fall . 
" and so they sit they in the jolly boat , and the crow do pull for land . 
and when they reach the shallow , henry o 'er the gunwale spring . 
he take the captain up on he back and he wade to the sand . 
the very first of exile in this distant part to stand . 
and a fortnight late henry take susannah for he wife , the comfort of he dark day to comfort he through life . 
and when they year of sentence pass , they happiness do grow with property , prosperity and child also . 
and so come all you gentle people who be lose in dark dismay , and remember this the black night must some time yield to day . 
remember this the wild storm eventually must pass and , like henry and susannah , may you find you joy at last .
