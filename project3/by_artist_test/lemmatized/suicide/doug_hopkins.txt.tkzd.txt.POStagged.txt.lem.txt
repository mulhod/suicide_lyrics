#pieces of the night be it any wonder this the star just do n't rush by when you 're only do 60th through this oh so vacant night ? 
but it 's lack something big this time . 
what the hell do you expect to find , aphrodite on a barstool by you side ? 
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know . 
somewhere in the distance out of sight . 
then i see : gin mill rainfall . 
what do you remember if at all ? 
only piece of the night . 
and be it any wonder in the middle of the crowd you let you foot get trample on when the music be this loud . 
but you want to be where you be , but it look much well from afar . 
a hillside in shadow between the people and the star . 
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know . 
somewhere in the distance out of sight . 
then i see : gin mill rainfall . 
what do you remember if at all ? 
only piece of the night . 
it seem so distant , but still only half the night away where notion between you question come too . 
be it any wonder where the piece of the night have be ? 
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .

#lost horizon the last horizon i can see be fill with bar and factory , and in they all we fight to stay awake . 
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again . 
drink , drink , drink in the garden and the grave . 
he have nothing leave to say , so he say he love me . 
i stand there grateful for the lie . 
drink enough of anything to make this girl look new again . 
drink , drink , drink in the garden and the grave . 
turn summer tree to bone and ice . 
turn insect song against the night with word we build and word we break . 
i 'm drink , drink , drink in the garden and the grave . 
maybe i can use you to reassure me . 
i will n't wish this indecision on anybody else . 
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again . 
and when the sin smile , how can it be wrong ? 
the last horizon i can see be not resign to memory . 
i never think i 'd still be here today . 
drink enough of anything to make me look new again . 
drink drink drink in the garden and the grave .
