take a walk

all these kinds of places make it seem like it 's been ages .
tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky .
i love this country dearly , i can feel the ladder clearly , but i never thought i 'd be alone to try .
once i was outside penn station selling red and white carnations .
we were still alone , my wife and i , before we married , saved my money , brought my dear wife over .
now i work to bring my family stateside , but off the boat they stayed awhile , then scattered across the coast .
once a year i 'll see them for a week or so at most .
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
practice is n't perfect , but the market cuts the loss .
i remind myself that times could be much worse .
my wife wo n't ask me questions .
there 's not so much to ask and she 'll never flaunt around an empty purse .
once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights , then decided she would stay the rest of her life .
i watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen and i sit and pray they never feel my strife .
but then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone .
he made some bad investments .
now the accounts are overdrawn .
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
honey , it 's your son .
i think i borrowed just too much .
we had taxes , we had bills , we had a lifestyle to front and tonight i swear i 'll come home and we 'll make love like we 're young and tomorrow you 'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids .
we can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes , but see i am no criminal .
i 'm down on both bad knees .
i 'm just too much a coward to admit when i 'm in need .
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk
i took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk , took a walk

# i 'll be alright

can you remember ever having any fun ? because , when it 's all said and done , i always believed we were , but now i 'm not so sure oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh
i drink a gin and take a couple of my pills and my parade will give you chills .
oh , honey , do n't give me up , oh , oh , oh , oh
i know we 've had enough .
you should go if you want to .
yeah , go if you want to .
i 'll be alright , be alright .
well , i 've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless .
your whole life 's been nothing but this .
i wo n't let you go unless i 'll be alright .
i 'll be alright .
i 'm so self-loathing that it 's hard for me to see reality from what i dream .
no , no one believes me - no , not a single thing .
my brain is racing and i feel like i 'll explode .
you 're looking at me from below .
this world was n't made for you .
just go find someone new .
you should go if you want to .
yeah , go if you want to .
i 'll be alright , be alright .
well , i 've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless .
your whole life 's been nothing but this .
i wo n't let you go unless i 'll be alright .
i 'll be alright .
why do i keep holding onto suffering ?
heads gone on now , walls , my thoughts are stumbling
this party is over now .
it is n't happening
the wind in the sails could tell i 'm only recovering .
you should go if you want to .
yeah , go if you want to .
i 'll be alright , be alright .
well , i 've made so many messes and this love has grown so restless .
your whole life 's been nothing but this .
i wo n't let you go unless i 'll be alright .
i 'll be alright .

#carried away

since my heart is golden , i 've got sense to hold in .
tempted just to make an ugly scene .
no , i 'm not as proper .
my money 's in copper .
ripped down from the brownstones to the street .
listen , i 'm your friend , do n't quote me , but not a friend worth noting .
yes , please do n't ever note me as your friend .
who says we have cold hearts acting out our old parts ?
dance before my favorite little scene , oh , oh , oh , oh .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
all your appeal , once again we 'd feel higher education making sense .
justify your thesis , certain that you need this .
tell me what your point is in defense .
listen , i do n't really know you , and i do n't think i want to , but i think i can fake it if you can .
let 's agree there 's no need , no more talk of money .
let 's just keep pretending to be friends , oh , oh , oh .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
wake up in the morning .
wake up in the evening .
wake up when you want to because no one 's really watching .
wish you had something to say about it , but we all have problems .
we 're all having problems and we all got something to say .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .
i get carried away , carried away from you , and i 'm hoping and i 'm praying because i 'm sorry , sorry about that , sorry about things that i 've said .
always let it get to my head .

#constant conversations

well , you 're wrapped up in a blanket and you 're staring at the floor .
the conversation 's moderated by the noisy streets below .
i never want to hurt you , baby .
i 'm just a mess with a name and a price and now i 'm drunker than before .
they told me drinking does n't make me nice .
you never know where some people will go .
yeah , some people been hurting me .
you can tell by a look , by the slightest crook in the neck or the blink of an eye .
well , then , they 'll see what they see , and they 'll do what they 'll do , but that does n't mean a goddamn thing .
you can listen if you want .
you can listen if you do n't .
yeah , they 'll talk .
yeah , they 'll even sing .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , they come singing through the window , singing through the trees .
yeah , they 're singing trough the bright spring leaves .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , yeah , they love you when they need you , but someday you 're going to need to find some other kind of place to go , oh .
now you 're standing in the kitchen , and you 're pouring out my drink .
well , there 's a very obvious difference , and it 's that one of us can think .
if there 's a bump in the road , yeah , you fix it , but for me i 'll just run off the road .
but tonight you 've got me cornered , and i have n't got a place to go .
you never know where some people will go .
yeah , some people been hurting me .
you can tell by a look , by the slightest crook in the neck or the blink of an eye .
well , then , they 'll see what they see , and they 'll do what they 'll do , but that does n't mean a goddamn thing .
you can listen if you want .
you can listen if you do n't .
yeah , they 'll talk .
yeah , they 'll even sing .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , they come singing through the window , singing through the trees .
yeah , they 're singing through the bright spring leaves .
everybody now , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , sing it loud , sing it loud .
yeah , they love you when they need you , but someday you 're going to need to find some other kind of place to go , do n't you know , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ?

#mirrored sea

well , he called the whole thing such a wild mistake .
he said he did n't mean no harm .
well , it was a big to-do , but nothing else was new .
his past checkered like checkerboards in central park .
you do good in the light and the bad in the dark .
good men are scarce and few .
they 're always passing through .
oh , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
they 're all i see .
oh , let me be , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
oh mirrored sea , leave me be .
born with a chance that everybody takes , with all risk and hardly any reward .
bounce off the walls of your teens like in a pinball machine .
slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life like overheard insults or a cheating wife and then it 's down for the count , the lost that wo n't be found .
oh , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
they 're all i see .
oh , let me be , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
oh mirrored sea , leave me be .
everyone 's alone .
oh , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
they 're all i see .
oh , let me be , you mirrored sea .
your waves , they 're haunting me .
oh , mirrored sea , leave me be .

#cry like a ghost

all on my own , where i found you alone , you were caught up in somebody else 's mess and , yes , i drank all those drinks on my own .
my life 's become some blurry little quest .
and the clock kept ticking slowly , and you leaned over to ask me if i even had a clue where i was .
well , i lied down your wood floors , and my brain and body took course in the night and then , as though it never was .
it all began to feel the same .
i want to know where they keep the rain .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb ,
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough is enough .
sick to the bone on the steps to my home .
the moon shined through the drapery of leaves to her , to ignore everyone on my own , my true love , just to feel some made up breeze .
but , as my body crumbled , you walked as i just stumbled , and we spoke only of things made in my head .
you never once controlled me , what all the others told me that , if i kept on going , i 'd be dead .
it 's not just you who felt the pain .
now , tell me where they keep the rain .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb ,
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough is enough .
see what i 've done now .
i do n't understand
she says i screamed and that i raised my hand , but i never meant to .
was n't even there .
i never meant to .
i would never dare .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb ,
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough 's always too tough .
sylvia , right back where you came from .
you 're a pendulum , heartbroken and numb .
but , sylvia , no one 's going to tell you when enough 's enough .
enough is enough .

#on my way

ballerina , trapped between the walls of her own home .
oh , god , kristina , do n't once think that this madness is my fault alone .
now her nightmare 's in her hands .
still every day 's another chance .
i 'm on my way .
i 'm on my way .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
spinning one beat until i finally realize how busy i am .
we 're both so broken , and all i 'm long hoping is that we 'll stumble upon our love again .
just believe in me , kristina .
all these demons , i can beat them .
i 'm on my way .
i 'm on my way .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
i caught you dancing quietly .
it felt like being somebody else .
oh , my friend , it seems like our love is too lovely for everyone else .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .
i 'm on my way .
i 'm on my way .
let 's get married .
i 'll buy a ring and then we 'll consecrate this messy love .

#hideaway

who could love you in the way that you love you ?
you 're alone , darling , and there 's nothing to argue .
if your life evolves into ruin , everyone 's watching all that you 're doing .
say your head 's turning .
maybe you should start running .
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you cannot stay .
come and play , oh , my hideaway .
someday everything will be okay .
you 're not strong so you , you can hurt her so badly .
you do n't mean to , hurting her is too maddening .
when you do , it 's a war in your head .
what you mean to say is n't always worth saying .
take a deep breath as soon as you let go .
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you cannot stay .
come and play , oh , my hideaway .
someday everything will be okay .
what 's the point to this , feeling happiness in life ?
as we fight off our demise , or love as we play into its lies , oh honey .
hideaway , hideaway , where they 'll never say you cannot stay .
come and play , oh , my hideaway .
someday everything will be okay .

#two veils to hide my face

oh , mercy , in the leaves so green that brush against my hands , let the wind sing us our love songs as we sift within your sands .
do n't answer any prayers they have .
just lift our callous hearts with the bursting rays of august and your cold raindrops of march .

#love is greed

you want a love , a love for us .
you want a selfless love that we can always say we trust .
love has always been a mockery of those in love and scared to be in your need .
do n't want to love .
do n't want to hurt .
if all that loneliness requires just another 's comfort , better off being all on your own .
there 's a beauty in being alone .
today we 're arguing , it 's not worth making another person that 's just yours for the taking .
all your hoping and praying wo n't do more than saying that love is just greed .
it 's almost taken me , but now i can see love is just greed , a selfish little need .
you follow or you lead .
if we really love ourselves , how do you love somebody else ?
a love to us , a love to them .
it 's just the history repeating itself time and time again .
love is not a veil to hide your voice .
all this talk of love just turns to noise .
so you want love , a love so tough that even all these truths do n't seem as though they 're adding up .
have n't you already had enough ?
what 's this suffering remind you of ?
someday we 'll all agree it 's not worth making another person that 's just yours for the taking
all your hoping and praying wo n't do more than saying that love is just greed .
it 's almost taken me , but now i can see love is just greed , a selfish little need .
you follow or you lead .
if we really love ourselves , how do you love somebody else ?
a love all gone is just another story .
what 's gone sour once was glory .
it 's romance you want
well , ask for it , then .
honey , could you put your arms around me so ?
tell me things about you that i would n't know and tell me that you love me like you do and maybe i will too .
love is just greed .
it 's almost taken me , but now i can see love is just greed , a selfish little need .
you follow or you lead .
if we really love ourselves , how do you love somebody else ?

#it 's not my fault , i 'm happy

sorry i could n't be there , i was tied to a rocking chair .
i was beat down to a pulp , rocking back and forth somewhere .
if you knew , if you saw , you 'd have said it was the final straw , that my life was bound and tethered on a porch by the shore .
but there is no easy way to tell them so , the things you know .
and run , they say .
they think they know exactly so .
it 's not right , it 's not right .
how am i the only one who sees us fight ?
what are we ?
who are they ?
who says those bastards do n't deserve to pay ?
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance .
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair .
still i 'm the only one who seems to care .
it 's funny that being funny makes you feel like up and running when your past lingers like rain clouds , casting shadows below .
i could live with so many burdens .
i take all your hope and yearning , but there 's no one i want to take me for that petty little rose .
i used to glow .
once i had a love to show , a love they know .
they 're slow , so slow that they never know where i go .
it 's not right , it 's not right .
how am i the only one who sees us fight ?
what are we ?
who are they ?
who says those bastards do n't deserve to pay ?
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance .
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair .
still i 'm the only one who seems to care .
i know that it 's only something .
i 'm just working with what i 've been given .
it 's not my fault , i 'm happy .
do n't call me crazy , i 'm happy .
it 's not right , it 's not right .
how am i the only one who sees us fight ?
what are we ?
who are they ?
who says those bastards do n't deserve to pay ?
well , it 's enough , it 's just enough because we do n't stand a chance .
so , long you stay around , you 're just another song and dance .
it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair , it 's not fair .
still i 'm the only one who seems to care .

# where we belong

it 's gotten cold in here , but a solemn warmth draws near and with a gentle touch all these burdens and such fears are wiped clear .
who says you ought to stay ?
how 's this the easier way ?
it 's far from giving up .
cowards never say enough is enough .
and then i 'm lifted up out of the crimson tub
the bath begins to drain and from the floor he prays away all my pain .
who says that god exists ?
we ca n't see icons or myths , but , well , i believe in you .
do you believe in me , too , gabriel ?
all the things you ca n't control should never destroy the love one holds .
i found a place , i found a place , i found a place where we belong .
never be up and down , be in between the whitest clouds .
never did i ever think i 'd find all the things i 've found because how you keep on living when you 're always but a million down .
all i 've ever wanted was to be happy and make you proud .

#almost there

there are things you 'll never learn , like there 's nothing to hide from .
house of people at your door .
give it away , they 'll just take more .
but i do n't know what you want , but i ca n't get it out of my brain .
yeah , you 're almost there .
there are things you 'll never do , like even try to hurt me too .
god knows something more than ruin .
put you down and blamed my moods .
all this talk - i swear , i ca n't get it out of my brain .
yeah , you 're almost there .
yeah , you 're almost there .
