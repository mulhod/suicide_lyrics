bastard

the old bastard left his ties and his suit , a brown box , mothballs and bowling shoes , and his opinion so you 'd never have to choose .
pretty soon , you 'll be an old bastard too .
you get smaller while the world gets big .
the more you know you know you do n't know shit .
the whiz-man 'll never fit you like the whiz-kid did .
so why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
close your eyes , close your ears , young man .
you 've seen and heard all an old man can .
spread the facts on the floor like a fan .
throw away the ones that make you feel bad .
kids today getting old too fast .
they ca n't wait to grow up so they can get some ass .
they get nostalgic about the last ten years before the last ten years have passed .
so why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
tears land on a hand on a chest .
the old bastard had a paradigm arrest .
he got smaller and the world got big .
the more he knew he knew we did n't know shit .
the whiz-man never fit him .
the whiz-kid did .
so why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .
why you got to act like you know when you do n't know ?
it 's okay if you do n't know everything .

#you to thank

by the time the buzz was wearing off , we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot nevada sun .
kids piled high , and our moms and dads shook hands in a party of polaroid friends , rented a pool and hired a band .
maybe they knew more then we knew because they danced and drank while we jumped off the deep end .
oh i 've got you to thank for this .
christmas came around , yeah , and everything was going to crap and our moms and dads not a clue to be had .
yeah , we put on a pretty good act and they seemed to all need to believe it , so we danced and smiled and paddled hard beneath it .
oh i 've got you to thank for this .
you ca n't say you 've never had a doubt and smoked it down but really wanted out .
by the time the buzz was wearing off , we were standing out on the sidewalk with our tattoos that looked like rings in the hot nevada sun .
and they wo n't fade .
i 've got you to thank .

#jesusland

take a walk .
out the gate you go and never stop , past dollar stores and wig shops , quarter in a cup for every block .
and watch the buildings grow smaller as you go down the tracks , beautiful mcmansions on a hill that . overlook a highway with riverboat casinos and you still have yet to see a soul .
jesusland , jesusland .
town to town , broadcast to each house , they drop your name , but no one knows your face .
billboards quoting things you 'd never say .
you hang your head and pray for jesusland , jesusland .
miles and miles , and the sun going down .
pulses glow from their homes .
you 're not alone .
lights come on as you lay your weary head on their lawn .
parking lots , cracked and growing grass .
you see it all from offices to farms .
crosses flying high above the malls .
a longer walk through jesusland , jesusland .

#landed

we 'd hit the bottom .
i thought it was my fault and in a way i guess it was .
i 'm just now finding out what it was all about .
we 'd moved to the west coast , away from everyone .
she never told me that you called back when i was still , i was still in love till i opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
and i twisted it wrong just to make it right , had to leave myself behind .
and i 've been flying high all night , so come pick me up .
i 've landed .
the daily dramas she made from nothing , so nothing ever made it right .
she liked to push me and talk me back down till i believed i was the crazy one , and in a way i guess i was .
well i opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
dragging the sea of a troubled mind , had to leave myself behind .
singing bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
if you wrote me off , i 'd understand it because i 've been on some other planet , so come pick me up .
i 've landed .
and you will be so happy to know i 've come alone .
it 's over .
well i opened my eyes and walked out the door and the clouds came tumbling down , and it 's bye-bye , goodbye , i tried .
down comes the reign of the telephone czar .
it 's okay to call and i will answer for myself .
come pick me up .
come pick me up .
i 've landed .

#gracie

you ca n't fool me , i saw you when you came out .
you got your mama 's taste but you got my mouth .
and you will always have a part of me nobody else is ever going to see , gracie girl , with your cards to your chest walking on your toes .
what you got in the box only gracie knows .
and i would never try to make you be anything you did n't really want to be , gracie girl .
life flies by in seconds .
you 're not a baby , gracie , you 're my friend .
you 'll be a lady soon but until then you got to do what i say .
you nodded off in my arms watching tv.
i wo n't move you an inch even though my arm 's asleep.
one day you 're going to want to go .
i hope we taught you everything you need to know , gracie girl .
and there will always be a part of me nobody else is ever going to see but you and me , my little girl , my gracie girl .

#trusted

it 's funny , i know , but i 'm disappointed in you .
i thought you could read my mind but i came home early and saw that a drawer had been opened .
looks like you 've been reading my diary instead .
how does it feel to realize you 're all alone behind your eyes ?
it seems to me if you ca n't trust , you ca n't be trusted .
caught in a dream , picking up astral signals , some of them psychic .
you better watch what you think .
happens to be that everybody else 's dreams are freudian clues .
you better watch what you dream .
you want to see the other side , what 's going on behind the eyes .
still it seems if you ca n't trust , you ca n't be trusted .
did n't you know we 're as close as we can be ?
the sun 's coming up .
she 's pulled all the blankets over , curled in a ball like she 's hiding from me .
and that 's when i know she 's going to be pissed when she wakes up for terrible things i did to her in her dreams .
you want to see the other side , what 's going on behind the eyes .
still it seems if you ca n't trust , you ca n't be trusted .
did n't you know we 're as close as we can be ?
hello .

#give judy my notice

judy , could anyone be loved anymore than i love you ?
does it hurt you too ?
but judy , i 've been feeling small too long .
i love you so , but something 's wrong .
and i come running when you want me here .
and when you want me to , i disappear .
give judy my notice .
i knew if i made it easy for you , you 'd settle for me , yeah eventually .
but judy , i wo n't be your bitch anymore and follow you around and hold the door .
and i ca n't do this any longer .
the vacuum left is so much stronger .
give judy my notice .
give judy my notice .
judy you know i 'm not mad anymore , at least most of the time , but that could take a while .
i 've been living just to see you smile every once in a while .
tears fall , but that do n't mean nothing at all .
it 's just because i said it first .
yeah , that 's why it hurts .
and i 'm not sorry if you 're not sorry .
and you 're not sorry until i make you .
give judy my notice .

#late

under some dirty words on a dirty wall , eating takeout by myself , i played the shows , got back in the van and put the walkman on and you were playing .
in some other dive a thousand miles away , i played a thousand times before , and like pathetic stars , the truck stops and the rock club walls i always knew , you saw them too , but you never will again .
it 's too late .
do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
elliott , man , you played a fine guitar and some dirty basketball .
the songs you wrote got me through a lot .
just want to tell you that .
but it 's too late .
it 's too late .
no , do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
oh no things were looking up , at least that 's what i heard .
oh no someone came and washed away your hard-earned peace of mind when desperate static beats the silence up , a quiet truth to calm you down .
the songs you wrote got me through a lot .
just want to tell you that .
but it 's too late .
it 's too late .
no , do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .
it 's too late .
it 's too late .
no , do n't you know it 's been too late for a long time .

#sentimental guy

there 's a moment in my mind i scribbled and erased a thousand times like a letter never written or sent .
these conversations with the dead .
i used to be a sentimental guy .
now i 'm haunted by the left unsaid .
i never thought so much could change .
little things you said or did are part of me , come out from time to time .
probably no one i know now would notice .
but i never thought so much could change .
you drifted far away , far away it seems .
time has stopped , the clock keeps going .
people talking and i 'm watching as flashes of their faces go black and white and fade to yellow in a box in an attic .
but i never thought so much could change .
now i do n't miss anyone .
i do n't miss anything .
what a shame because i used to be a sentimental guy .

#time

think of me any way you want .
i can be the problem if that 's easier .
in your head , move the pieces around , things i 've said .
turn the memory upside down and it makes it better , i know , but sometimes it 's hard to swallow .
in time , i will fade away .
in time , i wo n't hear what you 're saying .
in time , but time takes time , you know .
tell your friends the things they want to hear and see .
start the drums .
band against the enemy and in time i will fade away .
in time , i wo n't care what you 're saying .
in time , but time takes time , you know .
in your head , move the pieces around , things i 've said .
turn the memory upside down .
it might make it better , i know , but sometimes it 's hard to swallow .
in time , i will fade away .
in time , i wo n't care what you 're saying .
in time , but time takes time , you know .
time takes time you know .

#prison food

you walked the earth , talked and never spoke a word .
she wonders who will be the first to go .
i said you know , the biggest things we got to face alone .
do n't want to waste time and go .
alone alone again .
alone alone again .
a trace of me , it floats in my periphery and , every time i turn to see , it goes .
alone alone again lone alone again .
alone alone again .
floating by like a satellite to pass the time , you 'll float by again and i can tell you about the little . things so you do n't think about the big things for a while .
you walked the earth , talked and never spoke a word .
she wonders who will be the first to go .
alone alone again .
alone alone again .
alone alone again .
alone alone again alone .
