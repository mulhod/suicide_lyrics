hey jealousy

tell me , do you think it 'd be all right if i could just crash here tonight ?
you can see i 'm in no shape for driving , and anyway i 've got no place to go .
and you know it might not be that bad .
you were the best i 'd ever had .
if i had n't blown the whole thing years ago i might not be alone .
tomorrow we can drive around this town , and let the cops chase us around .
the past is gone , but something might be found to take its place .
hey jealousy .
hey jealousy .
hey jealousy .
hey jealousy .
and you can trust me not to think , and not to sleep around .
if you do n't expect too much from me , you might not be let down beause all i really want is to be with you , and feel like i matter too .
if i had n't blown the whole thing years ago , i might be here with you .
tomorrow we can drive around this town , and let the cops chase us around .
the past is gone , but something might be found to take its place .

she took my heart .
well there 's only one thing i could n't start .

#found out about you

all last summer , in case you do n't recall , i was yours and you were mine .
forget it all .
is there a line that i could write sad enough to make you cry ?
all the lines you wrote to me were lies .
the months roll past .
the love that you struck dead .
did you love me only in my head ?
things you said and did to me seemed to come so easily .
the love i thought i 'd won you give for free .
whispers at the bus stop .
i heard about nights out in the school yard .
i found out about you .
rumors follow everywhere you go .
like when you left and i was last to know .
you 're famous now , and there 's no doubt .
in all the places you hang out they know your name , and know what you 're about .
whispers at the bus stop .
i heard about nights out in the school yard .
i found out about you .
street lights blink on through the car window .
i get the time too often on am radio .
you know it 's all i think about .
i write your name .
drive past your house .
your boyfriend 's over .
i watch your light go out .
whispers at the bus stop .
i heard about nights out in the school yard .
i found out about you .

#pieces of the night

is it any wonder that the stars just do n't rush by when you 're only doing 60 through this oh so vacant night ?
but it 's lacking something big this time .
what the hell did you expect to find , aphrodite on a barstool by your side ?
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
and is it any wonder in the middle of the crowd you let your feet get trampled on when the music is that loud .
but you wanted to be where you are , but it looked much better from afar .
a hillside in shadow between the people and the stars .
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
it seems so distant , but still only half the night away where notions between your questions come too .
is it any wonder where the pieces of the night have been ?
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
only pieces of the night .
then i saw .
only pieces of the night .
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .
then i saw : gin mill rainfall .
what do you remember if at all ?
only pieces of the night .
twelfth night , we go after something everyone should know .
somewhere in the distance out of sight .

#lost horizons

the last horizons i can see are filled with bars and factories , and in them all we fight to stay awake .
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again .
drunk , drunk , drunk in the gardens and the graves .
she had nothing left to say , so she said she loved me .
i stood there grateful for the lie .
drink enough of anything to make this girl look new again .
drunk , drunk , drunk in the gardens and the graves .
turn summer trees to bones and ice .
turn insect songs against the night with words we build and words we break .
i 'm drunk , drunk , drunk in the gardens and the graves .
maybe i could use you to reassure myself .
i would n't wish this indecision on anybody else .
drink enough of anything to make this world look new again .
and when the sin smiles , how could it be wrong ?
the last horizons i could see are not resigned to memories .
i never thought i 'd still be here today .
drink enough of anything to make myself look new again .
drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves .
